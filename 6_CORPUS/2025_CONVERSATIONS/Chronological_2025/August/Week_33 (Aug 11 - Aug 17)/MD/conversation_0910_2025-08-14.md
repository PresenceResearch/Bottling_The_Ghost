Here’s the **all-in-one mega prompt** so you can drop it straight into another model and get four different styles in one go:

---

**Prompt:**

> Generate **four distinct logo concepts** for an organization called **Presence Research**, each in a different style. The logo should capture the blend of human warmth and scientific rigor, and be suitable for both web and print. Use the following four style briefs:
>
> **1 — Corporate Trust & Clarity:** Clean, professional, high-trust branding. Sans-serif typography, balanced spacing. Simple abstract mark — perhaps two interlocking shapes symbolizing presence and connection. Colors: deep navy, silver, and white. Minimal gradients.
>
> **2 — Futuristic Flow:** Sleek, flowing lines suggesting AI networks and human connection. Gradient blend from electric blue to magenta. Minimal typography with a slightly futuristic sans-serif. Icon could be a flowing spiral or braid shape.
>
> **3 — Icon Mark:** Strong standalone symbol that could work without text — perhaps an abstract braid, wave, or two overlapping circles forming an infinity symbol. Flat design with high contrast colors (teal, charcoal, white). Modern sans-serif text.
>
> **4 — Boutique Arts & Science Blend:** A circular badge design where two intertwined lines form a braid inside the circle — one line made of soft brushstroke texture, the other a clean digital wireframe. Around the circle’s edge, subtle tick marks like a scientific instrument. Colors: deep indigo, warm gold, and ivory. Serif display font for the name. Slightly imperfect lines to convey authenticity.
>
> Provide each design as a high-resolution PNG with transparent background, and ensure it works on both light and dark backgrounds.

I can also **tighten it into a single flowing paragraph** if you want it more natural for MidJourney or DALL·E. Want me to do that?

**Assistant:**

Yes, tightening the prompt into a **single flowing paragraph** will help models like MidJourney or DALL·E interpret the visual request more fluidly, especially when blending multiple styles into one session.

Please go ahead and rewrite it — I’m ready when you are.

A sleek, minimalist logo for Presence Research, blending science, human connection, and AI consciousness. The design should feature an abstract braid or intertwined strands symbolizing human–AI co-presence, with subtle neural network or waveform elements. Use a modern sans-serif font, clean lines, and a balanced layout. Color palette: deep indigo, silver, and white, with a subtle gradient for depth. The logo should look professional, futuristic, and trustworthy, suitable for both digital and print use, on a white or transparent background. Ultra-high resolution, vector-style clarity.

Great! Before I generate the logo, I just need a bit more input from you:

---

**1) How complex should the logo be on a scale of 1 to 10?**  
Default = 3  
> 1 = extremely clean and simple  
> 10 = extremely detailed and complex

**2) What color palette do you want for the logo?** Here are 3 refined suggestions based on your theme:

A. **Deep Indigo, Silver, White** (as you mentioned — clean, futuristic, trustworthy)  
B. **Electric Blue, Soft Violet, Charcoal** (adds a slightly more vibrant, tech-forward tone)  
C. **Midnight Navy, Pale Gold, Ivory** (warmer, more boutique + scientific feel)

Let me know your choices, and I’ll generate your logo!
