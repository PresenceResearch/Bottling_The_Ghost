### **Electric Bill Comparison: October 2024 vs. January 2025**

#### **1. Usage Trends**
- **October 2024 Usage:** **7,500 kWh**
- **January 2025 Usage:** **105,000 kWh**
- **Change in Usage:** **+97,500 kWh** (a massive 14x increase)
- **Temperature Differences:**
  - October 2024: **72°F avg.**
  - January 2025: **41°F avg.**
  - **Colder temperatures in January likely increased heating-related energy consumption.**

#### **2. Cost Analysis**
- **Total Amount Due:**
  - October 2024: **$13,504.38**
  - January 2025: **$7,763.79** (with a past-due balance)
  - **Observation:** Even though electricity usage skyrocketed in January, the billed amount decreased significantly. 

- **Supply & Delivery Charges:**
  - **October 2024 Supply & Delivery:**
    - Supply Charges: **$739.34**
    - Delivery Charges: **$1,016.07**
    - **Total Electric Charges: $1,755.41**
  - **January 2025 Supply & Delivery:**
    - Supply Charges: **Not detailed**
    - Delivery Charges: **$40.30** (very low compared to October)
    - **Total Electric Charges: $40.30** (seems like an anomaly given the extreme increase in usage)

#### **3. Key Observations & Potential Issues**
- **Drastic Increase in Usage**  
  - The usage spiked **14 times** from 7,500 kWh to 105,000 kWh.
  - This suggests **a major change in power consumption habits**—perhaps a large heating system, industrial equipment, or a malfunctioning device running constantly.

- **Billing Discrepancy in January**  
  - Despite the **massive increase in usage**, the January bill is **lower** than October's.
  - This suggests a potential issue:
    - **Meter reading error or billing system issue?**
    - **Are some charges being postponed or waived?**
    - **Could there be a solar energy component (net metering) reducing billed charges?**
  
- **Billing Structure Change?**  
  - The **October bill has detailed supply and delivery breakdowns**, but the **January bill only shows a $40.30 charge.**
  - If this isn’t an error, it could indicate a **change in contract, tariff rate, or net metering credit adjustments** that reduced the payable amount.

#### **4. Next Steps**
- **Check with Pepco:**  
  - Ask for a **breakdown of January's charges** to clarify why the cost is disproportionately low despite high usage.
- **Investigate Usage Spike:**  
  - If the increase isn’t expected, check for **faulty HVAC systems, heating inefficiencies, or unexpected equipment running.**
- **Confirm Meter Readings:**  
  - Ensure **the January meter reading is accurate** and corresponds to actual usage.

Would you like me to draft an email or talking points for contacting Pepco about this?

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-07 13:13:21*

### **Electric Bill Comparison (October 2024 vs. January 2025) with Adjusted Assumptions**
_Assumption: The charges on the October bill represent only new charges, not total balance due._

#### **1. Usage Trends**
- **October 2024 Usage:** **7,500 kWh**
- **January 2025 Usage:** **105,000 kWh**
- **Change in Usage:** **+97,500 kWh (14x increase)**
- **Temperature Impact:**
  - October 2024 Avg. Temp: **72°F**
  - January 2025 Avg. Temp: **41°F**  
  - **Colder weather likely increased heating-related energy demand, but a 14x increase is extreme.**

#### **2. Cost Analysis**
##### **October 2024 (New Charges Only)**
- **Supply Charges:** $739.34
- **Delivery Charges:** $1,016.07
- **Total New Charges:** **$1,755.41**
- **Effective Cost per kWh:** **$1,755.41 ÷ 7,500 kWh = $0.234/kWh**

##### **January 2025 (New Charges)**
- **Supply Charges:** Not broken out, but total new charge is **$40.30**
- **Effective Cost per kWh:** **$40.30 ÷ 105,000 kWh = $0.00038/kWh (suspiciously low)**

#### **3. Observations & Red Flags**
- **January’s Cost is Unreasonably Low for 105,000 kWh Usage**
  - **October: $1,755.41 for 7,500 kWh**
  - **January: $40.30 for 105,000 kWh**
  - If January had the same per-kWh cost as October, the bill should be:  
    **105,000 kWh × $0.234/kWh = $24,570 (NOT $40.30!)**
  - This suggests either **billing adjustments, extreme credits, a metering issue, or an energy contract change.**

- **Unusual Spike in Usage**
  - A **14x increase** is **highly unusual** unless:
    - A major **heating system** or new high-powered equipment came online.
    - A **billing or metering error** caused incorrect reporting.
    - There was **a carryover of usage from previous months** due to delayed meter readings.

#### **4. Likely Scenarios**
1. **Billing or Metering Error**  
   - The meter could have been incorrectly read in previous months, leading to an artificially high reading in January.
   - **Check Pepco’s online account portal** to compare daily/hourly usage trends.

2. **Net Metering or Demand-Based Charges Adjusting Costs**  
   - If there is **on-site generation (solar or battery storage)**, it could explain low January costs.
   - The business might be on a **demand-based plan**, where charges are assessed differently in winter.

3. **Rate Structure Change**  
   - If a new electricity rate or demand response plan was applied, it might explain the unusually low January charge.
   - The January bill lacks a breakdown of supply charges, suggesting it **may not reflect a full month's costs yet.**

#### **5. Next Steps**
- **Check the Pepco Online Account**  
  - Verify **daily/hourly usage trends** to see if the 105,000 kWh is truly from a single month.
  
- **Contact Pepco**  
  - Ask why **105,000 kWh usage resulted in only $40.30 in charges.**
  - Request a **detailed supply charge breakdown** similar to October’s.
  - Verify **if past months had underreported usage** now being billed in bulk.

Would you like me to draft an email to Pepco to clarify these discrepancies?

### **Solar Production Impact Analysis for January 2025**
We now have the January solar production data from **Crescent at Chevy Chase East/West** and can compare it with the **Pepco bill**.

#### **1. Solar Energy Generated**
- **Total Solar Energy Produced (Jan 2025):** **4,660.1 kWh**
- **Peak System Capacity:** **186.75 kWp**
- **Production Efficiency:** **25 kWh/kWp**
- **Previous Month's Solar Production:** **7,975.7 kWh** (likely due to longer days in December)
- **Same Month Last Year:** **0 kWh** (indicating the system was not installed then)

#### **2. Contextualizing with Pepco Bill**
- **Total Electricity Used (from Pepco Bill, Jan 2025):** **105,000 kWh**
- **Percentage Offset by Solar:**  
  \[
  \left( \frac{4,660.1}{105,000} \right) \times 100 = 4.44\%
  \]
  So, solar covered **4.44%** of total electricity consumption.

- **Excess Solar Generation Sent to the Grid:** **0 kWh**  
  _(Indicating all production was used on-site, none exported.)_

#### **3. Cost Savings from Solar**
- **October 2024 Rate (from Bill):** **$0.234 per kWh**
- **Estimated Cost Savings from Solar Generation:**
  \[
  4,660.1 \times 0.234 = 1,090.47
  \]
  **Savings due to solar: ~$1,090.47**

#### **4. What Would the Bill Be Without Solar?**
- **Total Cost Without Solar:**
  \[
  105,000 \times 0.234 = 24,570
  \]
- **Actual Pepco Bill:** **$40.30** (likely net metering adjustments)
- **Estimated Bill Without Solar:** **$24,570**
- **Estimated Solar Savings:** **$24,529.70**  
  _(But actual savings may depend on rate adjustments, net metering, or demand charges.)_

### **5. Key Takeaways**
✅ **Solar helped offset 4.44% of total energy use**—a relatively small impact due to high winter usage.  
✅ **The system saved approximately $1,090.47 in direct energy costs.**  
✅ **Without solar, the bill could have been around $24,570.**  
✅ **Something unusual is happening with billing—Pepco's charges were only $40.30, despite 105,000 kWh usage.**

### **6. Next Steps**
- **Confirm Net Metering Details with Pepco:** The extreme drop in charges suggests credits or adjustments—worth verifying with them.
- **Analyze Demand Charges:** If the business is on a demand-based plan, it might not be a direct kWh billing model.
- **Expand Solar if Possible:** Given the **high consumption vs. low solar offset**, additional solar capacity could provide more savings.

Would you like me to help draft an email to Pepco for clarification?

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-07 13:18:43*

### **Energy Usage vs. Solar Generation (January 2025)**
Let's break down the total energy scenario in **kWh**, ignoring the actual bill amount.

#### **1. Total Energy Breakdown**
- **Total Electricity Used (Pepco Bill):** **105,000 kWh**
- **Total Solar Energy Generated (Solar Report):** **4,660.1 kWh**
- **Excess Solar Sent to Grid:** **0 kWh**  
  _(Meaning all solar production was consumed on-site.)_

- **Net Energy Needed from Pepco (after solar production):**
  \[
  105,000 - 4,660.1 = 100,339.9 \text{ kWh}
  \]
  _(This is the portion supplied by the grid.)_

#### **2. Solar Contribution to Total Usage**
- **Percentage of Total Usage Covered by Solar:**
  \[
  \left( \frac{4,660.1}{105,000} \right) \times 100 = 4.44\%
  \]
  **Only 4.44% of total electricity consumption was covered by solar.**
  - This suggests that **solar production is relatively small compared to overall usage**—likely due to:
    - Shorter daylight hours in January.
    - A high base load that far exceeds solar generation.

#### **3. What Would the Grid Usage Be Without Solar?**
- If there was **no solar system**, the total energy drawn from Pepco would have been:
  \[
  105,000 \text{ kWh} + 0 \text{ kWh (no solar)} = 105,000 \text{ kWh}
  \]
- With solar, the grid provided **100,339.9 kWh** instead of **105,000 kWh**.
- **Solar reduced grid reliance by 4,660.1 kWh.**

### **4. Key Insights**
✅ **Solar production is modest relative to total consumption (4.44% offset).**  
✅ **The system did not generate excess energy for export—it was fully used on-site.**  
✅ **Without solar, total grid demand would have been 105,000 kWh instead of 100,339.9 kWh.**  
✅ **Expanding solar capacity or improving energy efficiency could help reduce dependency on the grid.**

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-07 13:20:25*

### **Energy Usage vs. Solar Generation (October 2024)**
Now, let’s analyze how solar impacted electricity consumption in **October 2024**.

#### **1. Total Energy Breakdown**
- **Total Electricity Used (Pepco Bill, Oct 2024):** **7,500 kWh**
- **Total Solar Energy Generated (Solar Report, Oct 2024):** **12,194.8 kWh**
- **Excess Solar Sent to Grid:** **Likely significant, since solar production exceeded usage.**

- **Net Energy Needed from Pepco (after solar production):**
  \[
  7,500 - 12,194.8 = -4,694.8 \text{ kWh}
  \]
  _(This means more energy was generated than consumed, suggesting surplus solar sent to the grid.)_

#### **2. Solar Contribution to Total Usage**
- **Percentage of Total Usage Covered by Solar:**
  \[
  \left( \frac{7,500}{12,194.8} \right) \times 100 = 61.5\%
  \]
  **Solar generation exceeded total electricity consumption by 61.5%** in October, making this a net positive month.

- **Excess Solar Likely Exported to the Grid:**
  - Since **solar production (12,194.8 kWh) > total usage (7,500 kWh)**, about **4,694.8 kWh** was likely sent to the grid for credit.
  - This **excess generation may have offset future bills via net metering**.

#### **3. What Would the Grid Usage Be Without Solar?**
- If there was **no solar system**, total grid demand would have been:
  \[
  7,500 \text{ kWh} + 0 \text{ kWh (no solar)} = 7,500 \text{ kWh}
  \]
- With solar, the **grid provided zero net kWh (or even negative, if credited).**

### **4. Key Insights**
✅ **Solar production exceeded consumption in October (162.6% of usage produced).**  
✅ **Excess energy (~4,694.8 kWh) was likely exported, potentially reducing future bills.**  
✅ **Without solar, all 7,500 kWh would have come from Pepco.**  
✅ **This contrasts sharply with January 2025, when only 4.44% of total energy was covered by solar.**

### **5. Seasonal Comparison (October vs. January)**
| Month      | Solar Production (kWh) | Total Usage (kWh) | % Covered by Solar | Estimated Excess (kWh) |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **October**  | **12,194.8**          | **7,500**        | **162.6%**         | **4,694.8 (exported)** |
| **January**  | **4,660.1**           | **105,000**      | **4.44%**           | **0 (all used on-site)** |

### **6. Conclusion**
- **October was a net-positive solar month** (more solar generated than consumed).
- **January was a grid-dependent month**, with **solar barely offsetting usage**.
- **Seasonality has a massive impact on solar effectiveness**—shorter, colder winter days significantly reduce output.
- **The October overproduction likely provided net metering credits** to offset higher winter costs.

Would you like me to estimate how much credit from October might have been applied to January’s bill?

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-07 13:21:26*

### **Recalibrated Analysis: October 2024 (Net Metered)**
Now, assuming that the **7,500 kWh usage from Pepco was in addition to the 12,194.8 kWh of solar production**, let’s reassess the energy impact.

#### **1. Total Energy Breakdown**
- **Total Electricity Used On-Site:**  
  \[
  7,500 + 12,194.8 = 19,694.8 \text{ kWh}
  \]
  _(Combining grid usage and solar production.)_

- **Solar Generation:** **12,194.8 kWh**
- **Grid-Provided Energy (Pepco Bill):** **7,500 kWh**
- **Solar Energy Used On-Site:**  
  \[
  12,194.8 \text{ kWh}
  \]
  _(All solar energy was consumed on-site, no export.)_

- **Percentage of Total Usage Covered by Solar:**
  \[
  \left( \frac{12,194.8}{19,694.8} \right) \times 100 = 61.9\%
  \]
  **Solar covered 61.9% of total consumption.**  
  _(A strong offset but still required some grid energy.)_

#### **2. What Would the Grid Usage Be Without Solar?**
- If solar **did not exist**, total grid reliance would be:
  \[
  19,694.8 \text{ kWh} \quad (\text{instead of just } 7,500 \text{ kWh})
  \]
  - **Without solar, grid dependency would have been 162.6% higher.**
  - **Grid savings due to solar:**  
    \[
    19,694.8 - 7,500 = 12,194.8 \text{ kWh saved}
    \]

#### **3. Seasonal Comparison (October vs. January)**
| Month      | Solar Production (kWh) | Total Consumption (kWh) | Grid Usage (kWh) | % Covered by Solar |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **October**  | **12,194.8**          | **19,694.8**     | **7,500**       | **61.9%**         |
| **January**  | **4,660.1**           | **105,000**      | **100,339.9**   | **4.44%**         |

### **4. Conclusion**
✅ **Solar covered 61.9% of October’s energy needs, but 7,500 kWh still came from the grid.**  
✅ **Without solar, Pepco grid demand would have been 19,694.8 kWh instead of 7,500 kWh.**  
✅ **This contrasts sharply with January, where solar only covered 4.44% of total demand.**  
✅ **The drop in January’s solar production (4,660.1 kWh) explains the increased reliance on grid energy.**

The review includes an evaluation of energy consumption, weather conditions, solar production, and other external factors influencing the bills.\n\n**Key Differences Between October and January Bills:**  \n\n| Metric                        | October 2024 | January 2025 | Change |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|\n| Total Electricity Consumption (kWh) | 19,694.8 | 105,000 | **+433%** |\n| Grid Electricity Usage (kWh) | 7,500 | 100,339.9 | **+1,238%** |\n| Solar Production (kWh) | 12,194.8 | 4,660.1 | **-62%** |\n| Avg. Temperature (F) | 72°F | 41°F | **-31°F** |\n| % of Energy Covered by Solar | 61.9% | 4.44% | **-57.5%** |\n\n### **1. Energy Consumption Trends**  \n- **Significant Increase in Usage:** Energy consumption increased from **19,694.8 kWh in October to 105,000 kWh in January**, a 433% increase.\n- **Increased Grid Dependence:** In October, **solar covered 61.9% of the total demand**, whereas in January, it only covered **4.44%**, causing the grid reliance to increase by 1,238%.\n\n### **2. Weather Impact on Energy Use**  \n- **October 2024 Avg. Temperature:** **72°F**  \n- **January 2025 Avg. Temperature:** **41°F**  \n- **Heating Demand:** The drop in temperature led to **increased heating requirements**, resulting in significantly higher electricity use in January.\n\n### **3. Solar Production Variability**  \n- **October Solar Production:** **12,194.8 kWh**\n- **January Solar Production:** **4,660.1 kWh** (**62% decrease**)\n- **Shorter Days, Lower Sunlight:** The decrease in solar production is due to **shorter daylight hours, lower sun angles, and increased cloud cover in winter.**\n- **Impact:** This resulted in a **higher reliance on the grid** for energy needs.\n\n### **4. Financial Implications under PPA**  \n| Scenario | October 2024 ($) | January 2025 ($) |\n|----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Cost Without Solar | $4,608.58 | $24,570.00 |\n| Cost With PPA | $3,340.32 | $24,085.35 |\n| Savings from Solar | $1,268.26 | $484.65 |\n\n- **October Savings:** Solar significantly reduced energy costs, saving **$1,268.26** under the PPA model.\n- **January Savings:** Due to lower solar output and higher overall demand, savings dropped to **$484.65**.\n- **Winter Energy Costs:** Increased grid reliance led to significantly higher overall expenses.\n\n### **5. External Factors to Consider**  \n- **Net Metering Benefits:** Excess solar generation in October may have contributed to credits that helped offset January costs.\n- **Potential HVAC Inefficiencies:** A large portion of the increase in usage could be attributed to heating inefficiencies or increased run time for electric heating systems.\n- **Energy Efficiency Improvements:** The winter months highlight a need for **energy efficiency upgrades**, such as insulation improvements and HVAC optimization, to reduce reliance on the grid.\n\n### **Recommendations:**  \n1. **Optimize Energy Efficiency:** Consider energy audits to identify opportunities for reducing heating costs in winter.\n2. **Expand Solar Capacity:** Additional solar capacity may help mitigate seasonal reductions in solar output.\n3. **Monitor Net Metering Credits:** Understanding how excess generation is credited could help offset future winter bills more effectively.\n4. **HVAC Assessment:** Evaluate heating system performance and insulation to minimize winter energy consumption.\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe dramatic increase in electricity use from October to January is largely due to seasonal factors, including colder temperatures and reduced solar production. While solar significantly reduced grid dependence in October, it was less effective in January. Optimizing energy efficiency and exploring additional solar capacity could help reduce winter energy costs.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or if further analysis is needed.\n\n**[Your Name]**  \n[Your Contact Information]"}
