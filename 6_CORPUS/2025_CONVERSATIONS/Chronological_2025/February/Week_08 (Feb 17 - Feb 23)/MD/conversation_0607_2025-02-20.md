what is the loaded kWh rate?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-20 16:29:20*

To determine the **loaded kWh rate**, we need to divide the **total amount due** by the **total kWh usage** for the billing period.

### **Calculation:**
- **Total Amount Due:** **$10,655.86**
- **Total kWh Usage:** **2,522 kWh**

\[
\text{Loaded kWh Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Due}}{\text{Total kWh Usage}}
\]

\[
\text{Loaded kWh Rate} = \frac{10,655.86}{2,522} = 4.23 \text{ cents per kWh} \text{ or } \$4.23/kWh
\]

### **Key Insights:**
- This **$4.23/kWh** rate is **heavily influenced by demand charges** ($9,749.79 in this case).
- If demand were reduced, the **effective kWh rate would drop significantly**.
- For a business with high peak loads but relatively low energy usage, demand charges dominate the cost structure.

Would you like a breakdown of **how much the rate would change if demand were reduced** by, say, 10-20%?

---

**You:**

*2025-02-20 16:30:09*

bro they used 1708896 kWh

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-20 16:30:31*

You're absolutely right! Let's **recalculate the loaded kWh rate** using the correct usage figure of **1,708,896 kWh**.

### **Loaded kWh Rate Calculation:**
- **Total Amount Due:** **$10,655.86**
- **Total kWh Usage:** **1,708,896 kWh**

\[
\text{Loaded kWh Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Due}}{\text{Total kWh Usage}}
\]

\[
\text{Loaded kWh Rate} = \frac{10,655.86}{1,708,896} = 0.00624 \text{ or } 0.624 \text{ cents per kWh} \text{ (or $0.00624/kWh)}
\]

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Your loaded kWh rate is **$0.00624/kWh (or **0.624 cents per kWh**).
- This is **incredibly low** because your cost structure is dominated by **demand charges**, not energy consumption.
- The demand charges ($9,749.79) make up **over 90% of your bill**, which means **reducing peak demand would have a way bigger impact than reducing kWh usage.**

Would you like to see a **scenario analysis** of how much your total cost would drop if peak demand were lowered by 10-20%?

**You:**

*2025-02-24 06:37:27*

what is the rate schedule on this bill

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-24 06:37:38*

The **rate schedule** on the bill is **General Service Primary ME-GPD**, which applies to **commercial and industrial customers** receiving primary voltage service. This rate structure typically includes:  

### **Key Components of the Rate Schedule (ME-GPD)**
1. **Customer Charge** – A fixed monthly fee for maintaining service, regardless of usage.
2. **Demand Charges** – Based on the highest **kilowatt (kW) demand** recorded during the billing cycle. This is a major cost driver for commercial accounts.
3. **Energy Charges (kWh-based)** – Charges based on total energy consumption.
4. **Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)** – A small percentage fee to fund grid infrastructure upgrades.
5. **State Sales Tax** – Typically 6% in Pennsylvania.
6. **Generation Charges** – If the customer has not chosen a third-party supplier, Met-Ed supplies generation at the **Price to Compare (PTC)**.

Would you like me to break down this rate schedule further with an updated analysis based on the latest Met-Ed tariffs?

**You:**

*2025-02-24 06:43:22*

please create a table inserting monthly production into monthly usage and calcualte kWh and $ offset

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-24 06:43:30*

I'll create a table that integrates **monthly solar production** into **monthly usage**, calculating both **kWh and dollar offsets** based on the current Met-Ed rates.  

To proceed, I need:  
1. **Your estimated or actual solar production (kWh) per month**  
2. **Any net metering policies or rate adjustments** (if applicable, such as credits for excess solar)  

If you don’t have actual production data, I can use **a typical solar production profile for Pennsylvania** based on system size. Let me know how you'd like to approach it!

**You:**

*2025-02-24 06:43:45*

please consoildate hourly peoduction inro monthly

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-24 06:44:07*

Got it! I will consolidate the **hourly production data** into **monthly totals** and integrate it into the **usage vs. production table**, calculating the **kWh and dollar offsets**. Let me process this now.

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-24 06:44:07*

The tool I need to process the hourly production data is currently unavailable. However, I can still manually create a **monthly usage vs. solar offset analysis** if you provide me with:  

1. **Hourly or monthly solar production data** (or I can estimate based on typical Pennsylvania solar production)  
2. **Net metering policy** (whether excess solar production earns credits at full retail rate or a lower rate)  

If you'd like, I can estimate production based on a **commercial-scale system size (e.g., 500 kW, 1 MW)** and typical solar generation patterns. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

**You:**

*2025-02-24 06:54:30*

please create monthly production numbers for a 41 kW solar array with a 1350 TSRF

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-24 06:55:04*

I'll calculate **monthly solar production** for a **41 kW solar array** with a **Total Solar Resource Fraction (TSRF) of 1350**. TSRF represents the percentage of available solar energy at a site compared to an ideal location, so I'll factor that into the production estimate.  

### **Assumptions:**
- **Production Estimate Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{Monthly Production (kWh)} = \text{System Size (kW)} \times \text{Solar Hours Per Month} \times \frac{\text{TSRF}}{1000}
  \]
- **TSRF Scaling Factor:** Since **1350** represents **35% more than an ideal 1000 TSRF system**, I will scale the standard output accordingly.
- **Location:** Pennsylvania (Mid-Atlantic), using **average solar hours per month**.

Would you like me to **integrate this into the monthly usage vs. solar offset table** to calculate **net usage, % offset, and dollar savings** based on Met-Ed rates?

---

**You:**

*2025-02-24 06:56:32*

yes please

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-24 06:56:56*

The tool I need to process and display the **monthly usage vs. solar offset analysis** is currently unavailable. However, I can manually outline the calculations for you.

---

### **Updated Analysis: Usage vs. Solar Offset**
I'll calculate the following for each month:
1. **Net Usage (kWh)** → *Total Usage - Solar Production*
2. **kWh Offset (%)** → *(Solar Production ÷ Total Usage) × 100*
3. **Dollar Offset ($)** → *Solar Production × Met-Ed Price to Compare ($0.1105/kWh)*
4. **Net Cost ($)** → *Total Cost - Dollar Offset*

---

### **Example for January:**
- **Usage:** 1,794,340 kWh  
- **Solar Production:** 3,044 kWh  
- **Net Usage:** 1,794,340 - 3,044 = **1,791,296 kWh**  
- **Offset %:** (3,044 ÷ 1,794,340) × 100 = **0.17%**  
- **Dollar Offset:** 3,044 × $0.1105 = **$336.35**  
- **Net Cost:** Total Cost ($220,472.06) - Dollar Offset ($336.35) = **$220,135.71**

{"name": "solar_offset_proposal", "type": "document", "content": "**Proposal for Energy Cost Analysis and Solar Offset Impact**  \n\n**Prepared for:** [Company Name]  \n**Prepared by:** [Your Name]  \n**Date:** [Today's Date]  \n\n---\n\n### **Executive Summary**\nThis proposal provides an analysis of current electricity consumption, projected costs, and the financial impact of a **41 kW solar array** with an annual production of **55,350 kWh**. By integrating solar generation into the facility's energy profile, we aim to reduce overall energy expenses and improve sustainability. The analysis includes a breakdown of usage, demand charges, and financial offsets due to solar production.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Energy Consumption & Costs**\n- **Average Monthly Usage:** 1,708,896 kWh\n- **Annual Total Cost:** $2,472,987\n- **Effective Rate:** **$0.118/kWh** (including demand charges and fees)\n- **Major Cost Drivers:**\n  - Demand Charges: ~$8,699 per month\n  - Distribution Charges: ~$9,694 per month\n  - Generation Charges: ~$188,800 per month\n  - Sales Tax & DSIC: Varies per month\n\n---\n\n### **Impact of Solar Production**\n- **Total Annual Solar Generation:** 55,350 kWh\n- **Monthly Solar Contribution:**\n  - **Peak Generation Months:** May–July (~6,900–7,000 kWh/month)\n  - **Low Generation Months:** December (~1,865 kWh/month)\n- **Average Monthly kWh Offset:** 0.17% to 0.48%\n- **Total Dollar Offset:** **$6,245 annually**\n\n---\n\n### **Financial Impact of Solar on Energy Costs**\n- **Annual Energy Cost Reduction:** ~$6,245\n- **Post-Solar Effective Rate:** **$0.117/kWh** (slight reduction due to modest offset)\n- **Projected 10-Year Savings (assuming stable rates):** ~$62,450\n- **Impact on Demand Charges:** Minimal, as solar does not significantly reduce peak demand\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways & Recommendations**\n1. **Solar Provides Modest Savings** – While a **55,350 kWh offset** results in annual savings of ~$6,245, it accounts for only **3.24% of total energy consumption**.\n2. **Consider Demand Reduction Strategies** – Since demand charges are a major cost component (~$104,388/year), implementing **load shifting, battery storage, or energy efficiency measures** could yield greater financial impact.\n3. **Explore Expansion of Solar System** – A larger solar array or a battery storage solution could maximize self-consumption and offset demand peaks.\n4. **Monitor Rate Changes** – Utility prices are expected to rise **by 1.9% annually** in the short term, increasing the financial benefit of solar over time.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- **Detailed Feasibility Study:** Conduct an in-depth analysis to determine the impact of **battery storage, demand response programs, and additional solar capacity.**\n- **Utility Rate Structure Review:** Evaluate alternative rate plans that could better align with solar generation and usage patterns.\n- **Implementation Plan:** If expanding solar capacity is viable, develop a financial model and seek incentives or tax credits to enhance ROI.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the current 41 kW solar system provides some financial relief, optimizing energy usage through **demand management, potential solar expansion, and strategic load shifting** will yield greater long-term benefits.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** [Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]  \n[Company Name]"}
