**Assistant:**

To connect your Chase credit or debit cards to Apple Wallet and enable balance tracking on the Wallet widget, follow these steps:

### 1. **Add Your Chase Card to Apple Wallet**
   - Open the **Wallet** app on your iPhone.
   - Tap the **"+"** button in the upper right corner.
   - Choose **"Credit or Debit Card"** and follow the prompts.
   - Use your iPhone's camera to scan your Chase card or enter the details manually.
   - Complete the card verification process by following instructions from Chase (e.g., through a code sent via text or email).

### 2. **Enable Balance Tracking**
   - Chase does not natively show your card balance in the Apple Wallet widget, but you can access balance information using the **Chase Mobile App**.
   - Some banks support direct balance tracking through Wallet, but as of now, Chase only supports basic card usage notifications.

### 3. **Use the Chase Mobile App for Balance Updates**
   - Download and log in to the **Chase Mobile App**.
   - Enable notifications for transaction alerts and balance updates in the app settings.
   - Add the Chase app’s widget to your home screen for quick access to your account balance.

### 4. **Alternative Widgets**
   - If you want card balances in a widget, use financial apps like **Mint** or **Personal Capital** that integrate Chase accounts and provide a widget with account details.
   - Add these widgets to your home screen for easy viewing.

Unfortunately, the native Apple Wallet app doesn't currently display card balances for Chase cards. Using a third-party financial tracking app alongside Wallet is the best workaround.
