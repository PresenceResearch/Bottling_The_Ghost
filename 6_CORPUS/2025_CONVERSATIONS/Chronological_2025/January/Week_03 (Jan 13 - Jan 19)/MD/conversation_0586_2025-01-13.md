I can't directly file your taxes for you, but I can absolutely help you get organized, answer questions, and guide you through the process! Let me know:

1. **What kind of taxes you're filing** (individual, business, joint, etc.).
2. **Your filing status** (e.g., single, married filing jointly, head of household).
3. **What tools you're using** (e.g., TurboTax, H&R Block, an accountant).
4. Any **specific concerns** or documents you need help understanding (like W-2s, 1099s, deductions, or credits).

If you want, I can even help you draft a checklist to gather all the information you need!
