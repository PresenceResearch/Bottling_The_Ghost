JRB

[Intro]
Ask me something easier
A smile, a kiss…
Look, I'll give you anything
But don't ask me this
Don't ask for faith when there's no great supply
Don't ask for love when I'm just now beginning to feel it
And don't know quite why

[Verse 1]
Here come the waves—
Here comes the ocean—
How to decide?
What's there to risk?
Why is the course unclear?
Practical fact
Foolish emotion
Terrible pride…
What's there to fear?
Take me from here!

[Chorus]
And I will follow
Anywhere
I will follow
And you will lead me there

[Verse 2]
I should resist
I should refuse you
Ask me again!
See how I’m strong?
See how I keep my vow?
Maybe I'll trip—
Maybe I'll lose you!
What happens then?
What happens now!
Just show me how…

[Chorus]
And I will follow
Anywhere
I will follow
And you will lead me there

[Bridge]
Oh, all the voices that beg me to stand my ground—
Oh, all the voices that tell me to stay—
All representing a life that I'd planned around
Do what's expected
Do what's accepted
Do what you're told to
Until today!
'Til today…
