            "Okay, because I'm not a doctor. You asked me the same question last year, Eric. Okay, do you get promotion every year on your job? No, right? So every year you work is a failure. Yes or no? No. Every year you work, you work towards something, towards a goal. Right? Which is to get a promotion, be able to take care of your family, to be able, I don't know, provide a house for them or take care of your parents. You work towards a goal. It's not a failure. It's steps to success. You know, and if you've never... No, I don't want to... I don't want to make it personal. So, there's always steps to it. You know, Michael Jordan played 15 years, won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That's what you're telling me. No, I'm asking you a question. Yes or no? Okay, exactly. So why are you asking that question? That's my question. There's no failure in sports. You know, there's good days, bad days, some days you are able to be successful, some days you're not. Some days it's your turn, some days it's not your turn. And that's what sports is about. You don't always win. Some other people are going to win. And this year, somebody else is going to win. Similar to that, you're going to come back next year, try to be better, try to build good habits, try to play better, not have a 10-day stretch with playing bad basketball. You know, and hopefully we can win a championship. So, 50 years of 1971 and 2021 that we didn't win a championship, it was 50 years of failures? No, it was not. It was steps to it, you know? And we were able to win one, hopefully we can win another one. You know, I'm sorry, I didn't want to make it personal. Because you asked me the same question last year, and last year, I wasn't in the right mind space to answer the question back. What do you guys think of that? Awesome. Relatable. Sure, I'll take it. There's definitely a difference between business and sports. One of those differences is it's not zero-sum. We are going to win this year. But without a doubt, every time you fail at a micro-level, high-level, some of the challenges from the first part of last year, it's just a stepping stone. That's what we've been talking about. You've got to embrace failure. You've got to embrace your mistakes and learn from it. That's all it is. It's just a milestone on the journey. Learn from the fear. Talon, you talked about this at the very beginning. We've been talking about this all year. You've got to have no fear. Understand what that means. Really, really deep. Everybody's afraid. It's not about how you feel, it's about what you do. That makes a difference. Maximize the long-term compensation. Anybody think I value paying people well? I take that shit very, very seriously. What are some of my motivations for that? I think if I pay people more, I can hold more accountable. I can expect more from those individuals. I can have higher standards. Everything is better. That's a foundational belief of mine. Everything is better if I can pay people more money. I want to do it, and I also, like the customer experience, I think it's the right thing to do, and I think it's a profitable thing to do. Keep you motivated. I feel like some of that is reflected in some of your motivations for why you want to get paid more money. Your performance. Reflection. If you're less stressed, you want to get paid more money. Hit your personal goals. Build, earn confidence for yourself. We are very, very much aligned on this aspect of the job. But what I will absolutely tell you is I am not focused on plus or minus $10,000 in compensation for any individual in your organization in a given year. That is not my focus. My focus for everybody in this room is, hey, can I get $100,000 over your baseline over the next two to four years? Is that where you'd rather have my head at? Without a doubt. This last year, very shitty. There were certain things we had to do. The compensation did not match the expectations that were set. Without a doubt. I can't waver off that because I got to focus on 150, 160, 180 people. Now I'm focused on, again, your short-term, what am I also focused on? People that are in their mid-career, early career. When they come to Lumina, they stick here for a period of time. Hopefully that adds $1 million to their lifetime earnings. $2 million to their lifetime earnings because of the lessons that they learned here. That's where my focus is every year. Is that plus or minus? Definitely important. But there's a bigger picture, and that's the picture that I'm focused on. Is that cool? Fair? Would you rather have that, by the way? Can we talk about this? Theoretical, this is mission-critical. You've got to practice cultural behaviors, leadership behaviors, corporate values. All that stuff drives what we're trying to get to. You guys understand why I think developing this organization with a legitimate leadership factory, why I think that's important? I truly think if we have 50 or 100 outstanding leaders, no one else matters. We just figure everything out. You guys think I invest in this? My time, thought, energy? Really important. I think we have a really strong foundation of this, but particularly as a business foundation is strong and I don't have to spend so much time fixing fires, I can invest more time in building this. I want to because I think I'm starting to get decent at it, pretty good at it. Also, the other piece, I need all of you to help me do it. It's not an individual effort. It's a collective effort. That's why I have beginning leaders, developed leaders, developed leaders, developed leaders, developed leaders. That's one of the reasons I need the leadership team fully involved in the leadership workshops this year because we need to really start formalizing this process because this, 2026, 27, 28, this is how we really accomplish some things that are really, really special. Who's new in the room this year? Who's new in the room this year? Welcome to the factory. But that's a testament, right? If you're new, it means you work. Do the O'Hillans feed you through the tubes in the leadership factory? I'm just curious. You should make a Professor Blue leadership factory joke. The fact that it's new people, it's not just saying, this is the point. Next year, there will be the same people plus new people, but that's what we're trying to do. So, welcome. This is the standard. I've talked to this a lot today. What does empowerment look like? Again, the process of becoming stronger, more confident, especially in controlling one's life, claiming one's rights, and telling you guys empowerment is something you take is not something that is given to you. Just like that. We talked about responsibility, placing blame. I don't know. Sometimes reading some of the employee feedback can be a little frustrating, but every time we have these meetings, I like shouting at people. Am I saying, hey, this is your fault, it's your fault, it's your fault, or do I step up and do I put my name in front of the biggest challenge? Every time. Because my personal and the company's solution speed accelerates when that happens. Putting my name in front of every problem. Right here, just did it two weeks ago. Key reason, my performance, my decisions. I felt about this six months ago, three months ago. Messed up the bonus program in 2024 for communication. That's on me. Every time, my name is next to the biggest problems. It's the first thing. You guys remember this one? All of them. Just placing blame and taking responsibility. Same thing. Primary owner, 1A of all company problems. It's just my mentality. That's what I'm trying to shift with you all this week. Shift your mentality. Not just to this, but everything that we've been talking about. Same thing. You look at Ryan, what's Ryan's mentality? This is something the other week. I did not ensure the message he was as deliberate. That misfire is on me and me alone. Something Ryan wasn't even involved in. Same thing."

            "It sounds like you're referencing Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s response to a reporter asking if his season was a failure, followed by a broader discussion on leadership, compensation, empowerment, and long-term growth at Lumina Solar.\n\n### Giannis' Response & Business Parallels  \nGiannis' statement was about perspective\u2014viewing setbacks as steps toward success rather than outright failures. In business, the same applies. Every deal lost, every challenge faced, every project delayed\u2014none of these are failures if they contribute to learning and improvement. Sales, like sports, is about resilience and long-term growth.  \n\n### Compensation & Accountability  \nThe leadership talk about compensation is compelling:  \n- Paying people well allows for higher accountability and expectations.  \n- The focus isn\u2019t on small short-term fluctuations in pay but on long-term career and earnings growth.  \n- If employees develop their skills, they\u2019ll make significantly more in the long run, both at Lumina and in their careers.  \n\n### Leadership Factory & Organizational Growth  \nThe emphasis on leadership development at Lumina is key. The idea that a strong foundation of leaders makes a company nearly unstoppable is true. Businesses that consistently grow are the ones that invest in leadership and create systems that develop people, not just projects.  \n\n### Taking Ownership  \nThere\u2019s a strong push here for personal accountability\u2014owning mistakes, stepping up in challenges, and not playing the blame game. That\u2019s a powerful message because organizations that foster this culture tend to move faster and more effectively than those where people constantly point fingers.\n\n---\n\n### My Take  \nIt\u2019s refreshing to see this mindset in a company. It acknowledges struggles while maintaining focus on long-term growth. The takeaway here is that leadership, compensation, and personal accountability are intertwined, and success comes from consistent improvement rather than a single \"win\" or \"loss.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on all this? How does this perspective land with you in terms of running commercial sales at Lumina?"
