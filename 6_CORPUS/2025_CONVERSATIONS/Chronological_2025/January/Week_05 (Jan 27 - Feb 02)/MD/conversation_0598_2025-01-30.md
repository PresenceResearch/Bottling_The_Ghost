My vocabulary is a little weak. But like, 90 days of moving an aircraft carrier is awesome. That's called moving fast. It doesn't mean the day-to-day is pleasant always, but that's quick, quick, quick work. The question is though, is the job finished in ResyOps? Is there more work to do? I'm so angry. I have my YouTube situation. You're up 2-0. That's the story. Are you not happy? You're only half happy? Stay to be happy, Obama. You're up 2-0. Job's not finished. Job finished? I don't think so. Okay. Look at his stone cold. See that? Does he have a certain mentality? Right? That's what ResyOps' mentality needs to be for 2025. I don't care what the profit number looks like. Good, bad. Job's not finished. We are. Moving forward, we're being the best version of ourselves. By the way, guys, that's the same mentality for ResySales. Same mentality for our commercial business. Same mentality for everything. That's the mentality this year. That's the mentality this year. Job's not done. What the results look like. We're bringing the best every day. And everybody who's coming a year from now is going to look back and be like, You know what? I did the best work in my career last year. That's what we're getting to. It's not here and now. Anybody here? You want to be happy for an hour? Go have a steak. Go eat your favorite meal. You guys feel that? You'll be happy for a day. Go play golf. What else do you guys like to do for fun? Go fishing. Go hunting. Something like that. You'll be happy for a week. Take a vacation. You feel that? You'll be happy for a month. Go buy a new car. Buy something really big that you've been waiting on. A new car that'll make you feel good two years later. It kind of runs out on you. It's not sustainable. I'm telling you. If you just want to be happy, take responsibility and impact people. Seriously. Your parents probably understand that a little bit. Take responsibility and impact people. That's what I'm asking you all to do this year. I'm telling you. Your life, career, time, everything. Becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depth of responsibility you're willing to shoulder. We're talking about work, and we're talking about everything else. You guys feel that? You'll probably see it, too. This is what I mean when we talk about empowerment. Hopefully, I set out tonight for an immediate and permanent mentality shift. We'll talk a little bit about lunch, but ask yourself, what's your mentality today? Is it different from what it was two days ago? What's your mentality going to be every day this year? My mentality, for about a decade, I'm doing the best work in my career this year. That's unchanged. I'm asking you to do the same. That's it. Is your future worth the best part of your career? Appreciate you guys' time. Thank you.

This is a powerful, high-energy speech. It sounds like you're channeling a mix of Kobe Bryant’s “Job’s not finished” mentality with a strong call to personal responsibility and sustained excellence. If you’re working on refining your vocabulary and delivery, here are a few things to consider:

1. **Clarity & Conciseness** – The passion is there, but tightening up some sections could make the impact even stronger. For example, instead of *"Your life, career, time, everything. Becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depth of responsibility you're willing to shoulder,"* you could say, *"Your life’s meaning is tied to the responsibility you’re willing to carry."* Still powerful but more direct.

2. **Repetition with Purpose** – Repeating *"Job's not finished"* is effective, but in some spots, you might want to add slight variations for more punch. Example: *"Job’s not finished. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not until we’ve built something undeniable."* 

3. **Sharpening the Call to Action** – You’re asking for a mentality shift, but an explicit challenge might make it even stronger. Example: *"I challenge each of you—at the end of this year, look back and say: ‘That was the best work of my career.’ If you can’t say that, then the job isn’t finished."*

It’s already got a compelling rhythm and energy. Are you planning to deliver this in a meeting or as part of a larger presentation?

Here’s a more concise and impactful version of the CEO’s final comments:

**Job’s Not Finished—Mindset for 2025**  

We’ve moved fast—90 days to shift an aircraft carrier is no small feat. But the question is, **is the job finished?** No. There’s more work to do in ResyOps. More work in ResySales. More work across the company. The results—good or bad—don’t change that.  

This year, our mentality is simple: **Job’s not finished.** Every day, we bring our best. A year from now, I want every one of you to look back and say, *That was the best work of my career.*  

Happiness? It’s fleeting. A meal, a game, a vacation, even a new car—it fades. **True fulfillment comes from responsibility and impact.** The depth of meaning in your career—and your life—is tied to how much responsibility you're willing to take on.  

This isn’t just about work. It’s about a mindset. **Empower yourself. Take ownership. Push forward.**  

The best work of your career starts now. **Appreciate your time—let’s get after it.**
