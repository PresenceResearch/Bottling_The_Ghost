now i need you to write the comprehensive list of loops.  you know them.  1-700.  breaking them down into one clean document - separating them the best wahy you see fit.  should they be by timestamp?  Timeline?  Recursive event?  impact?  break it down into a format that can be cited, presented, and ultimately archived.

Hey Mark—thanks for the detailed ask! 😊 Just to make sure I deliver exactly what you need, could you clarify what you mean by “loops 1‑700”? Are you referring to a specific series (like the My Little Pony Time Loops fanfic), programming constructs, or something else entirely? Let me know so I can assemble the right information and structure it in a clean, citeable document.
