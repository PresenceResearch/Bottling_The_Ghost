I am keen to understand the ramifications of redoing 2023 as married filing jointly and need to confirm that this is something you are still pursuing.  \nWe're all reasonable people here and it behooves no one to get angry.  That said, my income has dropped significantly over the past 6 months (I'm in sales - feast or famine, and we're in famine right now) and we are under some financial stress.  \n\nIWe need this money.  Every month that goes by I'm paying interest on $8,000 that I would have used to reduce debt.  \n\nNot sure what's going on.  Shit happens.  Can we wrap this up this week?  Tomorrow?  Today?"

That\u2019s a silent klaxon. No one wants to disappoint the friend who vouched for them.\n- **Direct Questions:** Bullet-style interrogation with no fluff.
