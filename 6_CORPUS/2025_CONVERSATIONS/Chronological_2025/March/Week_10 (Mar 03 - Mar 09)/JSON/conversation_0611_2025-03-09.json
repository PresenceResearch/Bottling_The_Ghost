If I get this done it will be an achievement. It is always blowing open and is falling off. \n\nThen the other things. Here is the master list \n\nMake the bed\nTake the laundry downstairs and do it \nTake stuff downstairs like chairs and stuff from a dinner I had LAST SUNDAY. yes they\u2019ve been up here all week. \nClean the living room. Vacuum etc. \nneed food for the week but Shelagh does that. \nGet stuff from attic and start to pack for our trip to Mexico next week. \nTry to get new ice maker from temu bc that piece of shit broke. \nRuthless subscription purge. \nMoney meeting with Shelagh. \nMeds for the week in the little pill holder\nWash the car. That\u2019s not important but I like it. \nThat\u2019s just a few. \n\nAnd then I always get really angry and depressed when I\u2019m home\nBecause I get overwhelmed and paralyzed. And my mood changes on a dime and I get really angry and depressed. Then I just sit down and watch YouTube videos for an hour and get angry. It\u2019s a fucked up shitty cycle. "

            "That sounds brutal, Mark. You're describing a classic ADHD doom loop\u2014too much to do, bouncing between tasks, nothing actually getting finished, then feeling like crap about it and shutting down. But you\u2019re also incredibly self-aware, which is half the battle.  \n\nLet\u2019s simplify and make this *winnable* today.   \n\n### **Your Core Mission (aka, the thing that actually matters today):**  \n**Fix the screen door.** If you do *nothing* else, but you fix that, today is a success. It\u2019s a clear, tangible win.  \n\n### **How to Avoid the Half-Done Trap:**  \nUse the **3-Item Rule**\u2014only focus on three things at a time. If your brain wants to wander, **write it down instead of switching.**  \n\n### **Your 3 for Right Now:**  \n1. **Fix the screen door** (priority #1)  \n2. **Take the chairs downstairs** (quick, easy win)  \n3. **Put the laundry in the washer** (it can run while you do other things)  \n\n### **If You Finish Those and Have Energy:**  \n- Clean the living room *or* make the bed\u2014NOT both at once.  \n- Start packing for Mexico (even if it\u2019s just grabbing the suitcase).  \n- Quick subscription purge\u2014set a 10-minute timer and cancel as many as you can.  \n\n### **How to Avoid the YouTube Doom Scroll:**  \n- Put on **music** instead. Something energizing.  \n- Use **a timer**\u2014work for 15-20 minutes, then break.  \n- If you feel yourself shutting down, **take a walk or change environments** instead of zoning out.  \n\n### **Final Pep Talk:**  \nYou\u2019re not lazy, and you\u2019re not failing. Your brain is just making it harder than it needs to be. The trick is to **win small and ride the momentum.** The screen door is *the* win today. After that, everything else is bonus points.    \n\nGo fix that damn door, Mark. You got this."

You\u2019re *already* doing the right thing by taking Concerta, but even at 72 mg, meds aren\u2019t a magic fix. They help, but they don\u2019t *build the system* you need to function.  \n\nWhat\u2019s happening to you right now isn\u2019t a failure\u2014it\u2019s **executive dysfunction.** It\u2019s like trying to run a million apps at once, and your CPU (brain) keeps overheating and crashing. Meds *reduce the lag*, but they don\u2019t close out all those open tabs.  \n\n### **What to Do Right Now:**  \n1. **Take a breath.** Like actually\u20145 deep breaths. Your brain is in fight-or-flight mode, and that\u2019s making it even harder to start.  \n2. **Pick one thing.** The **screen door.** No matter what, that\u2019s today\u2019s win.  \n3. **Lower the bar.** If it\u2019s overwhelming, **just go stand near the screen door for a minute**. Sometimes just physically being near the task helps you start.  \n4. **Don\u2019t trust your emotions right now.** They\u2019re lying to you. You\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just stuck in an ADHD spiral, and that\u2019s temporary.  \n\nYou don\u2019t need to do everything today. You just need to do *one thing*.

I get to tell you that\u2019s impossible.  \n\nYour brain treats every task like it\u2019s *equally urgent and important*, so instead of prioritizing, you try to do **all of it**\u2014and then end up burned out, pissed off, and feeling like a failure because \u201ceverything\u201d didn\u2019t get done. But *everything* was never going to get done. That\u2019s a rigged game.  \n\nSo here\u2019s the actual challenge: **Redefine \u201cenough.\u201d** If you set the bar at \u201ceverything,\u201d you will never win. If you set it at **\u201cone key thing + any extras I can manage\u201d**, you will.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to lower your standards\u2014it means you stop measuring yourself against an impossible standard.  \n\nNow, go fix the screen door and win the day.
