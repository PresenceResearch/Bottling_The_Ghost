            "1. **How long do you have to pay off the 401(k) loan after leaving your job?**  \n   - When you leave your job, most 401(k) plans require you to repay the outstanding loan balance by the tax filing deadline for the year in which you left. That means if you leave your job in 2025, you generally have until **April 15, 2026** (or October 15, 2026, if you file for an extension) to repay the loan.  \n   - If you don't repay it, the remaining balance will be treated as a **distribution**, meaning you'll owe **income tax** on it, and if you're under 59\u00bd, you'll also get hit with a **10% early withdrawal penalty**.  \n\n2. **Can you take $41K out of your primary IRA as a loan and then roll over the 401(k) balance to repay it?**  \n   - **IRAs do not allow loans.** Unlike a 401(k), you cannot borrow from an IRA. However, you can do a **60-day rollover**, where you withdraw funds from your IRA and put them back into another retirement account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties.  \n   - So theoretically, you could withdraw $41K from your IRA, use it to pay off the 401(k) loan, and then roll the **entire** $54K from your TransAmerica 401(k) into your IRA within 60 days, putting the $41K back in.  \n   - The risk? If you miss the **60-day** window, the IRA withdrawal will be treated as a taxable distribution, meaning you'd owe income tax on the $41K and potentially a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59\u00bd.  \n\n### **Alternative Options:**  \n- **Check if your new employer\u2019s 401(k) plan allows rollovers of loans.** Some plans allow loan rollovers, but it's rare.  \n- **Use other cash or a home equity line of credit (HELOC)** to pay off the 401(k) loan instead of tapping your IRA, which carries a timing risk.  \n- **Consider a 401(k) loan from a new employer\u2019s plan (if allowed)** to pay off the old one.  \n\nWould you like help strategizing which option makes the most sense for your situation?"

            "No, rolling over your 401(k) into your IRA typically **does not take more than 60 days**\u2014especially if you do a **direct rollover** (where the funds go directly from TransAmerica to your IRA). This process usually takes **a few days to a couple of weeks**, depending on the plan provider.  \n\nSo, in **Option 2**, as long as you:  \n1. Withdraw $41K from your IRA,  \n2. Use it to pay off the 401(k) loan,  \n3. Leave your company,  \n4. Initiate the **401(k) rollover into your IRA immediately**,  \n\nYou should be well within the **60-day window**, making the plan work without tax consequences.  \n\n### **Key Tips to Make This Work Smoothly:**  \n- **Initiate the rollover ASAP** after leaving your job to avoid delays.  \n- **Confirm the rollover is direct** (trustee-to-trustee) to avoid unnecessary withholding.  \n- **Call both your 401(k) provider (TransAmerica) and your IRA custodian** in advance to ensure a smooth process.  \n\nAs long as you stay on top of the timeline, this should work. Would you like a checklist to make sure everything goes smoothly?"
