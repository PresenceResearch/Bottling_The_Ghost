**You:**

*2025-05-06 23:42:02*

Is there a way to just drop song titles into Spotify 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-05-06 23:42:02*

iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image2turn0image4Absolutely, Mark! While Spotify doesn't natively support pasting a list of song titles directly into a playlist, there are effective workarounds to streamline the process. Here's how you can do it:

---

### 🎧 **Option 1: Use Soundiiz to Import Your Song List**

[Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/tutorial/import-text-to-spotify) is a web-based tool that allows you to import a list of songs into Spotify. Here's how:

1. **Prepare Your Song List**: Create a plain text file (.txt) with each song on a new line in the format:
   ```
   Artist - Song Title
   ODESZA - Bloom
   Lane 8 - Lost in You
   ...
   ```


2. **Visit Soundiiz**: Go to [Soundiiz Import Text to Spotify](https://soundiiz.com/tutorial/import-text-to-spotify).

3. **Import Your List**:
   - Click on "Import Playlist" and choose "From File."
   - Upload your .txt file.
   - Confirm the tracklist and configure your playlist.
   - Select Spotify as the destination and confirm.

This method efficiently creates a Spotify playlist from your list of songs.

---

### 🖥️ **Option 2: Manually Add Songs Using Spotify Desktop App**

If you prefer not to use third-party tools:

1. **Open Spotify Desktop App**: Launch the Spotify app on your computer.

2. **Search and Add Songs**:
   - Use the search bar to find each song.
   - Once found, right-click on the song and select "Add to Playlist" > choose your desired playlist.

3. **Bulk Add from Existing Playlists**:
   - If you have songs in another playlist or your "Liked Songs," you can:
     - Hold down `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and click to select multiple songs.
     - Right-click on the selection and choose "Add to Playlist."

This method is more manual but doesn't require external tools.

---

### 📱 **Note on Mobile App**

The Spotify mobile app doesn't support bulk adding of songs to playlists. You'll need to add songs individually by:

1. **Searching for the Song**: Use the search function to find the song.

2. **Adding to Playlist**:
   - Tap on the three dots next to the song.
