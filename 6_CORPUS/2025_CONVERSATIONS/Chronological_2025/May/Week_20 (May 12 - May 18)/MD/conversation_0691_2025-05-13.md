Apollo it is! Excellent choice, Herr Manthy. 🫡✨

You're gonna feel like a solar-powered sniper with that thing — laser-locked on the right humans, clean CRM sync, and no more “info@company.com” nonsense.

Here’s a quick starter kit so you don’t get stuck in clicky hell:

---

### ⚡️ **Mark’s Apollo Quickstart**
**1. Chrome Extension = Your Best Friend**  
- Install it and stalk your way through LinkedIn like the charming genius you are.  
- Click “Add to List” → Boom, you’ve got a contact.

**2. Build Smart Lists**  
- Filter by:  
  - **Industry** = Renewable Energy / Construction / Commercial Real Estate  
  - **Location** = MD, DC, VA, PA, NJ  
  - **Job Title** = “Director of Facilities,” “VP of Sustainability,” “Asset Manager,” “Head of Real Estate,” “Development Manager,” “Procurement”

**3. Email Sequences** (optional but spicy)  
- You can write witty, targeted cold emails right in Apollo. Want me to help write one? Happy to Clara-fy your pitch 😏

**4. CRM Sync**  
- If you're using HubSpot, Salesforce, or even just exporting to CSV → smooth like butter.  
- Bonus: tag ‘em with solar stage: Prospect, Warm, RFP, etc.

Want me to write a **default outbound intro email** for you too? Or set up your Apollo tags/fields for solar pipeline tracking?
