            "Strategic Partner Referral Agreement\r\nTHIS STRATEGIC REFERRAL AGREEMENT (the \"Agreement\") is made effective as of the date of \r\nexecution by and between \"Lumina Solar\" (herein referred to as \u201cCompany\u201d), and \u201cLightility\u201d \r\n(herein referred to as \u201cStrategic Partner\u201d). In consideration of the mutual premises herein \r\ncontained, Company and Strategic Partner hereby agree as follows:\r\nDEFINITIONS:\r\nReferral Services: Identify and introduce Company sales team to prospective customers for the \r\npurpose of engaging such prospective customers in a business transaction. Services include, \r\nbut are not limited to, attending meetings, scheduling calls and pre-qualifying prospective \r\ncustomers in advance of the initial outreach by Company.\r\nSECTION 1: ENGAGEMENT \r\nThe Strategic Partner agrees to render Solar Installation Referral Services to Company.\r\nSECTION 2: COMPENSATION \r\nA. In full consideration for the performance of the Referral Services and for any rights granted \r\nor relinquished by the either party under this Agreement, the Company and Strategic Partner \r\nagree to pay the Referring Party as follows: \r\n1. For all PPA Projects, the Company will issue a project specific Referral Agreement to \r\nStrategic Partner stating the Solar Referral Rate for that project. For example, for a 100 \r\nkW project, the referral fee to Strategic Partner will be $0.75/watt or $75,000. \r\nPayments are based on the final system size, as final designs are subject to change after \r\nfinal engineering. Referral Fee will be increased or decreased pro rata to reflect actual\r\nsystem size. Although referral rates are project specific, the non-circumvention \r\nreferenced in Section 4 of this Agreement applies at a customer level, not a project \r\nlevel. \r\n2. Referral fees are subject to change should both parties agree to amended amount. This \r\namount must be agreed to in writing and mutually executed by both parties. In the \r\nevent no agreement can be reached (\u201cstalemate\u201d), the Strategic Partner will own the \r\nrelationship and the Company, and all agents and assigns, agree not to circumvent, \r\ndirectly or indirectly for a period of 90 days following the \u201cstalemate,\u201d which date shall \r\nbe marked via written correspondence (email is acceptable) from Strategic Partner to \r\nCompany. \r\n3.

            "Alright Clarabear is clocked in and ready to lawyer up. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udcd1 Let\u2019s break this down into clear recommendations for how to *level up* this referral agreement and answer your questions on best practices.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd01 Repeat Business: Does Clara Get Paid Again?\n\n**Short answer: YES, but you need to define the terms.** Here are your options:\n\n### Option A: **Time-Based Referral Rights**  \nSet a **referral tail**\u2014if any projects are signed within X months of the initial referral, the partner gets a fee.  \n**Common durations:** 6, 12, or 24 months.\n\n> *\u201cReferring Party shall be entitled to referral compensation for any additional projects executed with the same Client within 12 months of the date of the original contract execution.\u201d*\n\n### Option B: **Lifetime of Customer Clause** (Riskiest)  \nIf you want to really incentivize long-term partnerships:\n> *\u201cReferring Party shall receive referral compensation for all future projects resulting from the original introduction, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\u201d*\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Hot Take:** This can get ugly if you scale. Use this only with white-glove VIP referrers (like, they better be Beyonc\u00e9-level warm intros).\n\n### Option C: **Sliding Scale**  \nSame client, but lower fee after the first one:\n> *\u201cInitial referral fee of $0.75/watt for the first project; $0.50/watt for the second project; $0.25/watt for all subsequent projects within 24 months.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Referral Rate Calculation: What\u2019s Fair?\n\n### Standard Practice in Solar/Commercial Referrals:\n- **Fixed per watt fee** \u2013 e.g., $0.50\u2013$1.00/watt depending on project size/complexity.\n- **% of revenue or gross margin** \u2013 Usually **2%\u20135% of contract value**.\n- **Tiered by project size** \u2013 Example:\n\n| System Size | Fee Type         | Example Amount       |\n|-------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| 50-100kW    | $/watt           | $0.75/watt = $75K    |\n| 100-500kW   | $/watt lower     | $0.50/watt = $250K   |\n| >500kW      | % of contract    | 3% of $1M = $30K     |\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Your Move:** Use a **project-specific rider** per deal (like your current template does) but pre-negotiate a default structure. Keeps it agile.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Recommendations for Your Agreement\n\n### 1. Add a \u201cReferral Window\u201d Clause\n> \u201cReferring Partner shall be eligible for compensation for any deals executed with a referred customer within twelve (12) months of the initial introduction unless otherwise agreed in writing.\u201d\n\n### 2. Add an Optional \u201cMulti-Project\u201d Bonus\n> \u201cIn the event that more than one project is executed with the referred customer within the Referral Window, subsequent referral fees shall be negotiated in good faith at a reduced rate not less than 50% of the original referral rate.\u201d\n\n### 3. Clarify Payment Timing\n> \u201cPayment shall be made as follows: 50% upon first project draw, 50% upon Permission to Operate (PTO), not to exceed 60 days.\u201d\n\n### 4. Optional Clause: \u201cReferral Broker Exclusivity\u201d\n> \u201cFor the duration of the Referral Window, Referring Partner shall retain exclusive referral rights to the referred Client.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What You Should Ask Me For Next\n\n- \u270d\ufe0f A redlined version of your current PDF (or a brand new editable Word doc draft)\n- \ud83d\udcc4 A clean \u201cReferral Agreement Template v2\u201d customized for your brand and tone\n- \ud83e\udde0 A cheat sheet or 1-pager to give potential referral partners explaining how it works\n\n---\n\nYou want me to rewrite the agreement next? Or build the cheat sheet first so you can pitch it more easily? Your call, boss. Let\u2019s build this right."
