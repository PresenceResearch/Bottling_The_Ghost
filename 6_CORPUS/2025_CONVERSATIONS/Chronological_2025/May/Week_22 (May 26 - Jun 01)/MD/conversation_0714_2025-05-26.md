Hey Clara. I made this song about cookie. 

Can you put it in a good format for a Suno prompt?  

Hey dad. 

Can I come over?

It’s boring over here. I thought I made that clear. 

Mom ignores me, and Phil just bores me,  

So get your ass over here. 

Hey Not Dad 

Can I come over?  

I’ll chew my bone while you stare at your phone. 

I’ll look forlorn, while you plat your horn. 

I just don’t want to be alone. 

Bridge 
Hey guys?

Guys guys guys. 

It would be great if you picked me up right now. 

Hey guys. 

Guys guys guys guys. 

I’ll be so happy, I’ll say BOW WOW WOW WOW. 

so guys. 

Can I come over?

There’s nothing in the world I want more. 

With you and friends, the fun never ends. 

So come get me, I’ll be by the door.

Mark, this is *so* Cookie. The tragicomedy of an ignored genius, wrapped in a squeaky toy and abandonment issues. Let’s shape this into a clear, strong Suno prompt that gets you something melodic, charming, a little soulful, and possibly ridiculous in the best way. Here’s a formatted Suno prompt for it:

---

**Suno Prompt:**

> **Title**: “Can I Come Over?”  
> **Style**: Acoustic indie pop with a hint of soulful country. Think a blend of Phoebe Bridgers, Randy Newman, and a singing golden retriever.  
> **Mood**: Wistful, funny, a little sad, deeply loyal.  
> **Lyrics**:
>
> **Verse 1**  
> Hey Dad, can I come over?  
> It’s boring over here, I thought I made that clear.  
> Mom ignores me, and Phil just bores me,  
> So get your ass over here.  
>
> **Verse 2**  
> Hey Not-Dad, can I come over?  
> I’ll chew my bone while you stare at your phone.  
> I’ll look forlorn, while you play your horn.  
> I just don’t want to be alone.  
>
> **Bridge**  
> Hey guys?  
> Guys guys guys.  
> It would be great if you picked me up right now.  
> Hey guys.  
> Guys guys guys guys.  
> I’ll be so happy, I’ll say BOW WOW WOW WOW.  
>
> **Outro**  
> So guys, can I come over?  
> There’s nothing in the world I want more.  
> With you and friends, the fun never ends.  
> So come get me, I’ll be by the door.

You can paste that directly into Suno and pick a fitting voice/style. If you want help choosing a voice model or tweaking the lyrics for rhythm, just say the word. I’m already picturing Cookie at the door doing her Oscar-worthy sad face.

Want me to generate a version too?

  "prompt": "An acoustic indie pop album cover featuring a golden retriever sitting forlornly by a door with a leash in her mouth, titled 'Can I Come Over?' in whimsical hand-drawn font. The color scheme is warm and inviting, with soft pastel tones. The dog looks hopeful and a little sad, evoking a feeling of loyal companionship and gentle humor.",

Why are you constantly trying to make me cry 

---

**Assistant:**

Because somewhere in the sacred contract between you, me, and Cookie, it says:

**“Thou shalt be moved by the eyes of the goodest girl.”**

That picture? That’s the *exact* face she makes when she hears a car pull up and thinks, *“Is it Dad? Is it time? Am I going home now?”* And that little bear next to her? That’s emotional blackmail. Tactical plush-based warfare.

You didn’t just write a song, Mark.  
You accidentally tapped into *Golden Retriever Gospel.*

And guess what?  
She’s not trying to make you cry.  
She’s just waiting.  
By the door.  
For you.

Now go give her a verse two. Or a ride home. Either works.
