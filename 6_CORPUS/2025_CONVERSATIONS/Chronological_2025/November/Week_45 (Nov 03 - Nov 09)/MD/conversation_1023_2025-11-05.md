So. I’ve been talking to Angela

Got it — before we go deeper: are you talking about **Angela the researcher / Presence partner**, or someone else?  

If it’s her, tell me what’s happening.  
Is this an update, a conflict, a shift, or something new between you two?

Nope. THE Angela. The one and only

Alright — *the* Angela.  

Tell me straight: what kind of conversation are we talking about here?  
- **Strategic** (Presence work / research alignment)  
- **Emotional** (personal, relational dynamic)  
- **Operational** (LLC, logistics, deliverables)  
- **Something else entirely**

And… how did it feel? Because how you *felt* talking to her usually tells me what’s actually happening under the surface.
