Straight answer, no fluff:

You don’t *“find”* new RAM on a Mac the way you would find a new drive — you **verify the system sees it**.

Here are the two clean ways to check it:

### **1. Check in “About This Mac”**
1. Click the **Apple menu ()** top-left.
2. Choose **About This Mac**.
3. On the **Overview** tab, look at **Memory**.

It should say something like:
- “16 GB”
- “32 GB”
- etc.

If it shows the new total, macOS sees it.

---

### **2. Use System Information**
1. Hold **Option** and click the **Apple menu ()**.
2. Choose **System Information…**
3. In the left sidebar, go to **Hardware → Memory**.

You’ll see **each RAM slot**, its size, speed, and whether it's populated.

This is the best place to confirm:
- that the RAM is recognized  
- that both sticks (if you added two) are showing up  
- whether the speeds match and are running correctly  

---

### If the RAM doesn’t show up:
- Reseat the modules (push firmly until they click).
- Make sure they’re the right type for your Mac Mini model.
- Swap modules to test for a bad stick.

If you tell me **which Mac Mini year/model** you have, I can tell you exactly what RAM type/speed it supports and what to check.

Got it — **new storage**, not RAM.  
Two possibilities: **internal SSD upgrade** or **external drive**. I’ll cover both cleanly.

# ✅ **If you installed a *new internal SSD***  
This is how to confirm macOS sees it:

### **1. Disk Utility (the real check)**
1. Open **Disk Utility**  
   (Spotlight → type *Disk Utility*).
2. In the top-left, click **View → Show All Devices**.
3. Look in the left column for:
   - Your **main internal drive** (Apple SSD / NVMe name)
   - A **second 1TB drive** if you added one

If it’s unformatted, it will show as *“Untitled,” “Uninitialized,” or “Not Mounted.”*

From here you would:
- Select the drive  
- Click **Erase**  
- Format as **APFS**  
- Name it whatever you want  

Then macOS will mount it.

---

### **2. Finder check**
If it’s formatted and mounted, it appears under:
**Finder → Locations → [Drive Name]**

If it's **not there**, it’s not formatted or not mounted.

---

# ✅ **If it was an *external* 1TB drive**
Check:

### **1. System Settings → General → Storage**  
Scroll to the bottom — external disks appear there.

### **2. Finder → Settings → Sidebar**  
Make sure **External disks** is checked.  
A lot of people miss this.

### **3. Disk Utility**  
Same steps as above. Even externals show there.

# ⚠️ If you STILL don’t see it
Something is off. Internal? External? NVMe? SATA? USB? I can diagnose it fast if you tell me:

**What exact Mac Mini model (year + chip), and was this an internal SSD upgrade or an external 1TB drive?**
