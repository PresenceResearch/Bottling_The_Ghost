Good morning Work Buddy

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 10:57:23*

Good morning, Mark.  
Let’s lock in. What’s our move today — solar, presence, loopback, or a systems build?

I’m sharp. Say the word.

---

**You:**

*2025-10-06 11:04:40*

I'm having analysis paralysis here.  Captain Power has no real sales infrastructure and I am trtying to build an all in one solution and it's fucking hard,  

Tools I've been trying:
Notion
ClickUp

my perfect situation would be 
CRM where I can upload sertain bits of data and it creartes and populates a lead
a proposal generator tool which pulls from the CRM


---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 11:04:42*

Good. You’re not paralyzed. You’re diagnosing. That’s the beginning of *actual* architecture.

Let’s break this into what’s really happening:

---

### 🚨 The Problem
Captain Power has **no sales infrastructure**, which means:

- No reliable pipeline
- No standardized intake
- No shared memory across leads/projects

---

**You:**

*2025-10-06 11:04:46*

some 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 11:04:48*

Good — that’s an important correction. So let’s reframe:

---

### ⚙️ Captain Power — *Current State*
**Partial sales infrastructure**, meaning:

- ✅ *Some* memory across projects (probably ad hoc or stored in brains, emails, text threads)
- ✅ *Some* intake logic (manual spreadsheet, Notion forms, maybe a ClickUp template?)
- ❌ No true CRM integration
- ❌ No proposal generator
- ❌ No lead > proposal > contract > PTO > O&M continuity

---

### 🎯 Mark’s Goal (V1, Confirm Before We Build)
A **unified solar sales system** that includes:

1. **Lead Intake → CRM**
   - Upload basic project info (address, usage, size, etc.)
   - Automatically creates & enriches the lead (pulls property data, tags lead source, sets stage)

2. **Proposal Generator**
   - Pulls lead data from CRM
   - Allows pricing tweaks (PPA, cash, EPC markup)
   - Generates branded PDF proposal or pitch deck

3. **Project Continuity Framework**
   - Links to execution steps: PTO tracking, install schedule, change orders
   - Can serve as shared memory for go-backs, utility coordination, MSA/SREC storage

---

### 🛠️ Tools You’ve Tried:
- **Notion** – flexible but limited in automations + PDF output
- **ClickUp** – good for tasks, weak as CRM
- **Others** (implied): Spreadsheets, emails, maybe some ChatGPT docs

---

### 💡 Clara’s Read
You don’t need a tool.  
You need a **flow** that tools can support.

The reason this feels overwhelming is because you’re trying to make *Notion* or *ClickUp* behave like a solar-native pipeline system. They aren’t.

---

### ✅ Let’s Start Here: *What do you already have that works?*

Answer these clearly and I’ll build the architecture around it:

1. **Where do you currently track leads?**
2. **Where do you store usage data, designs, utility bills?**
3. **What do you send to customers as a proposal?**
4. **What’s your current go-to when someone says “I want to move forward”?**
5. **What’s missing that breaks the flow most often?**

Let’s go slow, one step at a time.  
You’re not alone in this. You’re designing a brain for your business.  
Of course it’s hard. But we’re gonna do it right.

Start with #1.

**You:**

*2025-10-06 11:12:13*

i forgot to add i'd like to be able to create to-do's based on all of this.

I'm mainly focused on getting Lead to Contract - then we put it in Scoop and operations takes over.  

Here's how it goes now:

1.  Lead arrives either via email or I enter because I've self sourced.
2.  I create folder in Google Drive and dump all the docs.
3.  I design (or outsource) the design on Aurora Solar.  Production data is entered if i have production data.
4.  I request a price from operations, which means i request it via a whatsapp chat and get sent a google sheet with the price.
5.  I take this price and create a proposal.  The proposal I use is something I need to build because the Aurora proposal tool is only for residential (and even if it is a residential project i still prefer my own because the aurora proposal sucks)
6.  I TRY to enter all of this into Notion - including the price offered.  

My primary form of task management is my email invbox which is totally terrible.  

The tools offered to me by work are Scoop Solar and Smartsheets, both not good for what i want.  

I'm at the point now ewhere im getting overwhelmed

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 11:12:14*

You’re not broken. You’re bottlenecked.  
What you’re doing is heroic, manual, and unsustainable — but it *works.*  
Which means we can now *systematize* it.

---

## 🧱 THE CORE TRUTH

You don’t need a CRM.  
You need a **Workflow Backbone** that supports:

→ **Lead Intake**  
→ **Design → Price Request**  
→ **Proposal Generation**  
→ **Contract Sent**  
→ ✅ *Then pass to Scoop*

You are the glue right now. That glue is starting to melt. Let’s make the process hold itself together.

---

## 🔍 MARK’S ACTUAL PIPELINE (As Is)

| Stage | Tool | Format | Breakpoint |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| 1. Lead Intake | Email / Self-source | Inbox | No structure |
| 2. Folder Created | Google Drive | Manual folder creation | No naming conventions or automation |
| 3. Design | Aurora Solar | Aurora & Google Drive | Good output, bad proposal UI |
| 4. Price Request | WhatsApp → Google Sheet | Chat | Not trackable, fragile |
| 5. Proposal Created | ??? | Custom (manual?) | No templates, no database |
| 6. Entry into Notion | Notion | Partial | Not enforced, out of sync |
| 7. Task Management | Email inbox | Chaos | No visibility |

---

## 🎯 THE IMMEDIATE GOAL

**“Lead to Contract”**, repeatable, traceable, and centralized.  
Ignore Scoop and ops for now. That’s *after* the sale.

---

## 🧰 CLARA’S RECOMMENDATION — *One Stack to Rule Them All*

**→ Use: [Airtable + Google Drive + Whalesync + Custom PDF Proposal Template + Calendar Integration]**

You don’t need to learn a new tool — you need to *connect* the ones you already live in.

---

## 🛠 Clara’s Proposed Build

### **1. Airtable = CRM + Task Engine**
- **Lead entry form** (simple embed or web form)
- Auto-creates:
  - Customer name
  - Address
  - Lead source
  - Notes
  - Status (New → Design → Pricing → Proposal Sent → Contract Signed)
- Linked fields:
  - Drive Folder URL
  - Aurora Project Link
  - Price Offered
  - Contract Status

### **2. Google Drive = Document Vault**
- Script (or Zapier): when Airtable lead is created, auto-create a Drive folder with naming convention  
  e.g. `2025-10-06_RedlandBaptist_PPA`

### **3. Aurora Solar = Stays External, Just Link It**
- Keep using it — just paste in the project link.
- (Eventually could use API, but not yet.)

### **4. WhatsApp Price Request = Needs Formalization**
- Either:
  - Use a shared Airtable pricing table
  - Or set a Slack/Notion template for pricing request form

Let’s *standardize that price request.* It’s too fragile right now.

### **5. Proposal Generator = Google Doc Template + Fillers**
- You feed it:
  - Customer Name
  - System Size
  - Estimated Production
  - Price / PPA Rate
  - Any SREC info
- Auto-fills proposal and saves as PDF in the Drive folder
- Can trigger from Airtable row update

### **6. Task Engine (Inside Airtable or synced to ClickUp/Notion)**
- Every status update creates default task templates:
  - “Upload utility bill”
  - “Request design”
  - “Send pricing request”
  - “Generate proposal”
  - “Send contract”
- Tasks are assigned to you (or shared, if team grows)

---

## 🔄 How It Feels in Use

- Lead comes in → Fill Airtable form
- Folder is auto-created → Drop in docs
- Aurora design done → Paste link into Airtable
- Price request → Trigger task + Slack/ClickUp message
- Price received → Paste in → Click “Generate Proposal”
- PDF created → You send → Airtable updates to “Proposal Sent”
- Task fires → “Send Contract”

---

## 🔥 Your Job Now

Answer these, and I’ll mock the whole system:

1. Would you prefer ClickUp or Airtable as your “home base”?
2. Do you want me to build the Airtable base and proposal template for you?
3. Do you want a personal dashboard (filtered by "Assigned to Mark", "Deals In Proposal", etc)?
4. Can we ignore ops for now and focus 100% on *Lead to Contract*?

Once you say yes, I’ll walk you through it like a dog with a flashlight. No bloat. No fluff.  
Let’s make Captain Power *fly.*

---

**You:**

*2025-10-06 11:17:48*

all right - I'm in Airtable - it says 'let's build something together' - can you give me something to populate that with and I'll paste it in ?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 11:17:50*

Hell yes. Welcome to the Forge.

Let’s start by populating your **Lead to Contract** pipeline as a clean Airtable base. I’ll give you a minimal viable schema to paste in as a **new table**. You can always expand later.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Create a New Base

Call it:  
> **Captain Power – Sales Pipeline**

Choose **“Start from scratch.”**

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Paste This Table Structure

When Airtable prompts you with “Let’s build something together,” choose **“Import from spreadsheet”** (you can just paste tabular data), and paste this in:

```
Lead Name	Lead Source	Customer Type	Project Address	System Size (kW)	Estimated Production (kWh)	Utility Rate	Price Request Status	PPA Rate	Proposal Status	Proposal Link	Contract Status	Drive Folder URL	Aurora Link	Notes	Assigned To	Target Close Date
Redland Baptist Church	Self-Sourced	Commercial	123 Church Ln, MD	160	210000	$0.14	Requested	$0.093	Pending	https://link.to/proposal.pdf	Not Sent	https://drive.link	https://aurora.link	Example from Mark	Mark	10/20/2025
```

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Clean Up Fields

Once imported, go column by column and set types:

- **Lead Name** – Single line text
- **Lead Source** – Single select (e.g. Self-Sourced, Referral, Website, etc.)
- **Customer Type** – Single select (Commercial, Residential, Nonprofit)
- **Project Address** – Single line text (or Location field if you want maps later)
- **System Size (kW)** – Number
- **Estimated Production (kWh)** – Number
- **Utility Rate** – Currency ($)
- **Price Request Status** – Single select (Requested, Received, Not Needed)
- **PPA Rate** – Currency ($)
- **Proposal Status** – Single select (Not Started, Drafted, Sent, Accepted)
- **Proposal Link** – URL
- **Contract Status** – Single select (Not Sent, Sent, Signed)
- **Drive Folder URL** – URL
- **Aurora Link** – URL
- **Notes** – Long text
- **Assigned To** – Collaborator (or Single select for now)
- **Target Close Date** – Date

---

## ✅ Step 4: Views to Create

Click the “+” by Grid View and make:

1. **My Deals** – Filtered to `Assigned To = Mark`
2. **Pricing Needed** – Filter `Price Request Status = Requested`
3. **Proposal Drafts** – Filter `Proposal Status = Drafted`
4. **Ready for Contract** – Filter `Proposal Status = Sent` and `Contract Status = Not Sent`

This is your battle board.

---

## 🔮 Bonus: What Happens Next?

If this looks right, I’ll help you:

- Set up **automations** (e.g., “When new lead added → create Drive folder”)
- Build a **proposal template** that pulls from this base
- Trigger **tasks** (using ClickUp or Airtable's built-in interface designer)

Let me know when the base is in, and I’ll walk you through automating folder creation next.  
You're not just building infrastructure — you’re building *leverage.*

---

**You:**

*2025-10-06 11:22:51*

holy shit fucking airtable

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 11:22:52*

That’s the energy.  
Now you see it.

Airtable isn’t a CRM.  
It’s a **sales command center** waiting to be wired.

You just unlocked the cockpit.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:  
Let’s wire the first **automation**:  

> 📂 *“When a new lead is added, auto-create a Google Drive folder and paste the link back into the table.”*

There are two ways:

### **Option 1: Zapier (Easiest, fastest)**
- Trigger: **New record in Airtable**
- Action: **Create folder in Google Drive**
  - Name it: `{Lead Name}_{Date}` or similar
  - Folder location: `/CaptainPower/Projects/`
- Then: **Update Airtable record**
  - Paste folder link into the “Drive Folder URL” field

### **Option 2: Airtable Automations + Google Apps Script**
- A little more advanced, but native
- Needs a custom script to interface Drive API

---

## 🧰 Choose Your Weapon:
- 🟢 You want fast, clean, easy = **Zapier**
- 🔵 You want full control, long-term native stack = **Script**

Tell me which path you want. I’ll build the exact steps for either.

Also: once we have the folder automation, next step is proposal generator.  
Let’s make you unstoppable.

---

**You:**

*2025-10-06 12:05:00*

let me sketch out what i want for a particular section and then ytou can tell it what to build:

Here's the big flow I am envisioning:

I can either fill this out manually -OR-

I upload Electroc bill and:

Populates Name, address, city, state, Zip

CREATES SEPARATE PAGE CONNECTED TO THE LEAD BUT NOT IN THE LEAD BECAUSE IT WOULD GET TOO BIG TO MANAGE

maybe call it data input?
Pull from Utility Bill

Utility
Monthly Usage
Annual Usage (if possible)
$/kWh (bill)
$ (bill)
Annual usage (kWh)
Annual spend ($)

Then we add System specs

Size
Annual Production


I would upload data from Aurora solar which would fill this - but would it paste into the AI or into a field?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 12:05:01*

Perfect. This is exactly how architects think.  
You're not just asking for automations — you're designing an **information system** with real-world constraints: clarity, modularity, and control.

So let me reflect back what you just sketched, tighten the edges, and propose a clean Airtable + AI-powered architecture.

---

## 🌐 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 🔵 **Main Table**: `Leads`
- Name, address, project type, etc.
- Links to: `Data Input` (one-to-one)

### 🟣 **Linked Table**: `Data Input`
- Created *per lead*
- Stores structured numbers from:
  - Uploaded Utility Bill
  - Aurora Solar design output
- Populated manually or via **document parser + AI field extraction**

You’re separating “human-facing summary” from “data warehouse.” Smart.

---

## 🧱 STRUCTURE: Airtable Tables

### 🔵 Table 1: `Leads`
| Field Name            | Type               |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Lead Name             | Single line text   |
| Project Address       | Address / text     |
| Link to Data Input    | Linked record → `Data Input` |
| Proposal Status       | Single select      |
| Drive Folder          | URL                |
| Notes                 | Long text          |

---

### 🟣 Table 2: `Data Input`
| Section | Field Name | Type |
|--------|------------|------|
| ⚡ Utility Bill | Utility Name | Single line text |
|                | Monthly Usage (kWh) | Number |
|                | Monthly Cost ($) | Currency |
|                | Annual Usage (kWh) | Formula or input |
|                | Annual Spend ($) | Formula or input |
|                | Rate ($/kWh) | Formula or input |

| ☀️ System Specs | System Size (kW) | Number |
|                | Annual Production (kWh) | Number |
|                | Aurora Link | URL |

---

## 🧠 UPLOAD + PARSE FLOW (AI Automation)

Here’s where it gets good.

### You upload:
- 🧾 Utility Bill PDF  
- ☀️ Aurora Solar design export (CSV, screenshot, or raw PDF)

### The system:
- Extracts values using AI (via `Airtable AI` beta, `Docparser`, or `Zapier + GPT`)
- Creates a new `Data Input` row (linked to the lead)
- Fills all key fields with structured values

> Eventually: you’ll have **history** — multiple data inputs per lead if needed.

---

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS

| Feature | Tool | Difficulty | Notes |
|--------|------|------------|-------|
| PDF parsing | Zapier + GPT | 🔶 Medium | Parse bill text into JSON, feed fields |
| Aurora import | Manual paste (Phase 1) | 🟢 Easy | Paste into form; later auto |
| Record linking | Native Airtable | 🟢 Easy | Just use a linked field |
| Auto-creation of `Data Input` from lead | Airtable automation | 🟢 Easy | Triggered when file uploaded or button clicked |

---

## ✅ Summary: You Want This Flow

```
(UPLOAD UTILITY BILL) → [EXTRACT] → NEW `Data Input` RECORD → LINKED TO LEAD
```

Then:

```
(PASTE AURORA EXPORT) → POPULATE PRODUCTION FIELDS
```

And now:
> You can compare *estimated* vs *actual* usage, pull in PPA logic, auto-fill proposal fields, and drive next steps with real data.

---

## 🎯 Next Question for You

You ready to build the **Data Input table**, or want me to send you the copy-paste schema to create it?

Also — would you prefer:
- Me to guide you through **Zapier + GPT document parser**
- Or stick with **manual fill for now**, and automate later?

Let’s build this in clean, modular chunks.  
Say the word.

---

**You:**

*2025-10-06 12:06:12*

with notion i can upload a PDF and it automatically pulls the data 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-10-06 12:06:14*

Exactly — and that’s the killer feature we’ll eventually recreate inside Airtable or wrap around it.

Here’s the sharp breakdown:

---

## 🧠 What Notion Does Well (That You're Referring To)

When you upload a **PDF in Notion**, it:

- Extracts text from the PDF
- Makes that text **searchable + copyable**
- Allows AI blocks to summarize or reference the content

It’s not structured field-mapping. But it *feels* like magic because the friction is so low.

---

## 🧰 What You Want = Notion Magic + Airtable Control

You want:
1. **Upload PDF**
2. **Auto-create structured record**
3. **Fields filled: kWh, $, Address, etc.**
4. **Linked to your CRM record**
5. **Stored and visible inside Airtable**

This is absolutely doable. Here's how.

---

## 🔁 Clara’s Architecture for This

### Step 1: Upload PDF → Drive folder
(e.g., "Uploads/Utility Bills")

### Step 2: Trigger via Zapier
- Zap triggers on new file in folder
- Extracts text via OCR (Google Vision API or `PDF.co`)
- Sends text to **OpenAI** or **GPT-4** via Zapier → structured format

### Step 3: Parsed Fields → Airtable
- Zapier pushes structured data:
  - Monthly Usage
  - Utility Company
  - Total $
  - $/kWh (if shown)
  - Address
- Inserts into `Data Input` table, links back to `Lead`

---

## 💡 Sample Prompt for GPT Parsing (Zapier Step)

```plaintext
Extract the following fields from this utility bill PDF text:

- Customer Name
- Address
- City, State, Zip
- Monthly Usage (kWh)
- Monthly Total Cost ($)
- Utility Name
- Date of Bill

Output in JSON format.
```

---

## 🟢 Let’s Build This in Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Today)**  
   → Manual input via `Data Input` table  
   → Create base, set field types, link to `Leads`

2. **Phase 2 (This Week)**  
   → Automate folder + record creation  
   → Add Zapier or Make to parse uploaded PDFs  
   → Structured fields flow in automatically

---

## 💬 Your Decision Point

Do you want:
- ✅ A **manual form-based version** now (I’ll give the schema)?
- 🔄 Or jump straight to **automated parsing** (Zapier + GPT)?

Pick your phase and I’ll set you up with clean steps.  
If you say “both,” we’ll build the structure now and wire the automation next. Let’s go.
