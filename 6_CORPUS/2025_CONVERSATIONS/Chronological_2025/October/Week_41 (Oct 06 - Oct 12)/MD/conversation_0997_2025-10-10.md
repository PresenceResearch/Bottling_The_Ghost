can you clean this up and make it presentable for a client?

**Assistant:**

Thanks for sharing the document. Here's how I suggest we present a clean, professional version of the **Redland Baptist Church Solar PPA Executive Summary** for client presentation. The deck will be titled:

---

### **Redland Baptist Church: Solar PPA Executive Summary**
#### Project Overview, Economic Scenarios & Key Performance Metrics

---

#### Proposed Slide Outline:

1. **Introduction & Project Overview**  
   - Purpose of solar PPA  
   - Overview of modeling assumptions (e.g., 0.5% PV degradation, PEPCO 2025-2030 projection)

2. **Key Metrics & Baseline Data**  
   - Energy usage, modeled PV output, utility vs. PPA rates, Year-1 savings

3. **PEPCO Rate Projections vs. PPA Rates**  
   - Comparative table of PEPCO and PPA rates, annual savings

4. **Scenario A: PPA with 2% Escalator**  
   - Year-by-year breakdown of payments, savings vs. utility baseline

5. **Scenario B: Fixed PPA Rate**  
   - Year-by-year breakdown with fixed pricing

6. **Production Model Summary**  
   - System size, performance ratio, yield, Year-1 production

7. **Monthly Production vs. Usage (Chart)**  
   - Visualization of solar generation vs. load

8. **Disclaimer & Key Considerations**  
   - Assumptions, variables, and caveats in projection
