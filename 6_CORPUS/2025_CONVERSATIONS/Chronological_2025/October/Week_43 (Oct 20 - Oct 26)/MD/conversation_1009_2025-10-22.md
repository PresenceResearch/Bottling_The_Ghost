Could you specify what “this” refers to — an image, document, song file, or conversation? Once I know what item you’re asking about, I can check or tell you its creation date.

It depends which specific version of the entity["place", "Maryland", 0] passenger plate you mean, but here are key dates:

- The current standard-issue passenger plate “Maryland Proud” design (red “MARYLAND” at top, state flag element) **began** being issued **September 26, 2016**. citeturn0search10turn0search12turn0search15  
- The prior “War of 1812” base design was issued from **June 14, 2010** to September 25, 2016. citeturn0search10turn0search8  

If you mean a special plate (vintage, historic, trailer, etc.), I can look up the exact “made” date for that version.
