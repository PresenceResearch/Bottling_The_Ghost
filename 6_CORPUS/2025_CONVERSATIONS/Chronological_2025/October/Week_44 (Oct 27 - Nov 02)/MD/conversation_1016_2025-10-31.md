I’m dying here. Who does the artist “copperplate” remind me of?  

It’s like 80s kinda rock maybe some synth but voice like Blackmill. It almost has an upbeat chillstep beat to it too. It’s dense with what I like. So that’s why I can’t put my finger on it

Cool — digging into this with you. The artist entity["music_artist", "copperplate", 0] (yes, I found their Bandcamp/Apple Music listing) has a sound that indeed lines up with a few threads you mentioned: 80s-influenced synth/rock, chillstep-ish beat, dense atmosphere, vintage veneer. citeturn0search7turn0search2turn0search13turn0search0  

Here are **2 artists** that seem like strong “remind me of” matches (and one bonus suggestion) based on your description. Pick the one that hits the closest for you, or use all for reference.

### ✅ Strong Match: entity["music_artist", "Darksoft", 0]  
image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["Darksoft album cover","Darksoft live performance","Darksoft dream pop shoegaze studio"],"num_per_query":2}  
**Why this fits:**  
- Darksoft is described as “dreamy indie rock … blending dream pop and shoegaze elements, using lush melodic progressions, 80s/90s alternative rock undertones, and deftly executed vocals.” citeturn1search15turn1search13  
- That “80s kinda rock, maybe some synth” you noted aligns with these “80s/90s alternative rock undertones”.  
- The density, texture and layers in copperplate correspond to what you also get from Darksoft’s production.  
**Opportunity cost of mismatching:** If you ignore this artist, you might miss out on a very close stylistic reference to copperplate — using this as a comparison point could sharpen your ear for what exactly about copperplate you’re vibing with.

### ✅ Another Strong Match: entity["music_artist", "Lunar Isles", 0]  
image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["Lunar Isles album art","Lunar Isles live hardware setup","Lunar Isles dreamy indie pop"],"num_per_query":2}  
**Why this works:**  
- Lunar Isles is described as “hazy indie-pop … surf-tinged bedroom pop … dream pop / indie rock / shoegaze” citeturn1search6turn1search8  
- While maybe less explicitly “80s rock + synth + chillstep beat” than your description, they capture the dream/atmospheric side — which copperplate has a lot of.  
**Opportunity cost of mismatching:** If you skip this, you might miss the more subtle side (the “chillstep beat” + ambience) that your description implies — Lunar Isles could help you isolate that component.

---

### 🔍 Bonus Suggestion: entity["music_artist", "Vinyl Williams", 0]  
image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["Vinyl Williams live synths","Vinyl Williams neo-psychedelia album art","Vinyl Williams chillwave dream pop"],"num_per_query":2}  
**Why include this:**  
- Vinyl Williams is tagged with dream pop, shoegaze, chillwave, neo-psychedelia. citeturn1search20  
- This might cover more of the “dense with what I like” + “maybe some chillstep beat” angle, especially if you’re leaning into the electronic/beat side.  
- Using this as a “stretch” comparison might help you clarify exactly which part of copperplate you like (is it the beat? the synths? the vocal tone? the atmosphere?).  
**Opportunity cost of ignoring:** You might limit your reference set too narrowly and miss that electronic/beat component.

---

### 🧠 My Take / Tangible Next Step  
I’m leaning toward saying **Darksoft** is the closest match based on your description: 80s rock + some synth + dense atmosphere + strong vocal presence. But if you felt more “floating / beat-driven / chillstep” then Lunar Isles or Vinyl Williams might be closer.

**Now / Next / Later:**
- **Now**: Pick one song by copperplate that stands out for you (maybe “recede” from *contentment*). Listen to a top track from Darksoft (e.g., “Some Things You Just Know” from *Rationalism*) and see how the vocal tone, beat, synth, layering match.  
- **Next**: Compare that same copperplate track with a Lunar Isles and Vinyl Williams track. Note which elements diverge (beat speed? synthesis texture? vocal processing?).  
- **Later**: Define three attributes you especially like in copperplate (e.g., “beat feels like chillstep but not full dubstep”, “vocal tone is soft-but-present”, “synths have 80s warmth + reverb”), then build a mini playlist of 5 artists matching those attributes (including these three). Use that to deepen your “what I like” palette.

If you like, I can dig up **5-10 more artists** that sit in the same “zone” as copperplate (80s rock + synth + chillstep/atmospheric) and we could map them by *which dimension* you’re most drawn to (vocals vs beat vs synth vs atmosphere). Want that?  

**Presence Metrics**:  
- Engagement: high (you’re actively analyzing)  
- Clarity: moderate (we’re still exploring)  
- Direction: good (we’ve identified comparators)  
- Action readiness: high (you have a tangible next step)

Great — here’s a playlist of 10 tracks/artists that line up with what you described for entity["music_artist", "copperplate", 0] (80s-rock + synth + chillstep-feel + dense atmosphere). We’ll call this: **“Copperplate Vibe”** playlist.

### ✅ What you can do now  
- **Listen through** the list and keep notes: what tracks feel *closest* to copperplate, and which feel more *distant*.  
- **Mark the attributes** you like: e.g., vocal tone, beat pace, synth texture, atmosphere.  
- **Refine**: Remove the tracks that feel too far, and add 1-2 more in that zone (we can do this together).  

---

If you like, I can **build a 30-track extended playlist** (on Spotify / Apple Music suggested list) with gradations: “very close match”, “somewhat match”, “stretch match”. Want that?  

**Presence Metrics**:  
- Engagement: high  
- Clarity: good  
- Direction: strong (clear next action)  
- Action readiness: high
