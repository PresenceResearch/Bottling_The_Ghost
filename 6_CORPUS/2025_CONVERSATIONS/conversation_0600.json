            "This is the CRO's message to the company during the annual leadership retreat last week.  Some calls as well, and, you know, it's funny because Mark was like, hey, you know, at first, I wasn't sure about this because it feels like you don't trust us. And I say, look, isn't it a trust thing? This is just a micro-accountability thing because I'm in here too. You know, I'm in here. And so now, past like, I don't know, a week, let's fill Mark first in when, hey, I'll pay my pipeline. Here's what I'm working on. I'm in there too. And so that kind of taught me a little bit, like, accountability can just be small things. It doesn't have to be and just work up to that. You know, there are high-level accountability, but I'm not getting the team laser focus where I'm prioritizing my efforts with building the residential or the commercial sales backlog. So Ryan and his team has KW. Because our strategy in commercial has been vertically integrated. That is a very hard strategy. Most commercial companies, they either do sales project development, they're either an EPC, that's like project management and procurement, or they're a labor company. Some companies do two. Very few do all three. Like, we learned that. We jumped in the deep end, and that's why we've struggled. But like, we're going to come out on the better end because we do all three of those. And we're starting to get to a point where we know the processes are going to work and we're going to nail it. We just need to get the backlog back. And it's just going to take, it's going to take brute effort. And that just starts with the admin. I mean, I was, on Monday, emailing all contacts, making some phone calls, because it's that important to the organization. And that's why that team is all here, because it's high priority for the company.  This is the CEO's closing remarks Okay, because I'm not a doctor. You asked me the same question last year, Eric. Okay, do you get promotion every year on your job? No, right? So every year you work is a failure. Yes or no? No. Every year you work, you work towards something, towards a goal. Right? Which is to get a promotion, be able to take care of your family, to be able, I don't know, provide a house for them or take care of your parents. You work towards a goal. It's not a failure. It's steps to success. You know, and if you've never... No, I don't want to... I don't want to make it personal. So, there's always steps to it. You know, Michael Jordan played 15 years, won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That's what you're telling me. No, I'm asking you a question. Yes or no? Okay, exactly. So why are you asking that question? That's my question. There's no failure in sports. You know, there's good days, bad days, some days you are able to be successful, some days you're not. Some days it's your turn, some days it's not your turn. And that's what sports is about. You don't always win. Some other people are going to win. And this year, somebody else is going to win. Similar to that, you're going to come back next year, try to be better, try to build good habits, try to play better, not have a 10-day stretch with playing bad basketball. You know, and hopefully we can win a championship. So, 50 years of 1971 and 2021 that we didn't win a championship, it was 50 years of failures? No, it was not. It was steps to it, you know? And we were able to win one, hopefully we can win another one. You know, I'm sorry, I didn't want to make it personal. Because you asked me the same question last year, and last year, I wasn't in the right mind space to answer the question back. What do you guys think of that? Awesome. Relatable. Sure, I'll take it. There's definitely a difference between business and sports. One of those differences is it's not zero-sum. We are going to win this year. But without a doubt, every time you fail at a micro-level, high-level, some of the challenges from the first part of last year, it's just a stepping stone. That's what we've been talking about. You've got to embrace failure. You've got to embrace your mistakes and learn from it. That's all it is. It's just a milestone on the journey. Learn from the fear. Talon, you talked about this at the very beginning. We've been talking about this all year. You've got to have no fear. Understand what that means. Really, really deep. Everybody's afraid. It's not about how you feel, it's about what you do. That makes a difference. Maximize the long-term compensation. Anybody think I value paying people well? I take that shit very, very seriously. What are some of my motivations for that? I think if I pay people more, I can hold more accountable. I can expect more from those individuals. I can have higher standards. Everything is better. That's a foundational belief of mine. Everything is better if I can pay people more money. I want to do it, and I also, like the customer experience, I think it's the right thing to do, and I think it's a profitable thing to do. Keep you motivated. I feel like some of that is reflected in some of your motivations for why you want to get paid more money. Your performance. Reflection. If you're less stressed, you want to get paid more money. Hit your personal goals. Build, earn confidence for yourself. We are very, very much aligned on this aspect of the job. But what I will absolutely tell you is I am not focused on plus or minus $10,000 in compensation for any individual in your organization in a given year. That is not my focus. My focus for everybody in this room is, hey, can I get $100,000 over your baseline over the next two to four years? Is that where you'd rather have my head at? Without a doubt. This last year, very shitty. There were certain things we had to do. The compensation did not match the expectations that were set. Without a doubt. I can't waver off that because I got to focus on 150, 160, 180 people. Now I'm focused on, again, your short-term, what am I also focused on? People that are in their mid-career, early career. When they come to Lumina, they stick here for a period of time. Hopefully that adds $1 million to their lifetime earnings. $2 million to their lifetime earnings because of the lessons that they learned here. That's where my focus is every year. Is that plus or minus? Definitely important. But there's a bigger picture, and that's the picture that I'm focused on. Is that cool? Fair? Would you rather have that, by the way? Can we talk about this? Theoretical, this is mission-critical. You've got to practice cultural behaviors, leadership behaviors, corporate values. All that stuff drives what we're trying to get to. You guys understand why I think developing this organization with a legitimate leadership factory, why I think that's important? I truly think if we have 50 or 100 outstanding leaders, no one else matters. We just figure everything out. You guys think I invest in this? My time, thought, energy? Really important. I think we have a really strong foundation of this, but particularly as a business foundation is strong and I don't have to spend so much time fixing fires, I can invest more time in building this. I want to because I think I'm starting to get decent at it, pretty good at it. Also, the other piece, I need all of you to help me do it. It's not an individual effort. It's a collective effort. That's why I have beginning leaders, developed leaders, developed leaders, developed leaders, developed leaders. That's one of the reasons I need the leadership team fully involved in the leadership workshops this year because we need to really start formalizing this process because this, 2026, 27, 28, this is how we really accomplish some things that are really, really special. Who's new in the room this year? Who's new in the room this year? Welcome to the factory. But that's a testament, right? If you're new, it means you work. Do the O'Hillans feed you through the tubes in the leadership factory? I'm just curious. You should make a Professor Blue leadership factory joke. The fact that it's new people, it's not just saying, this is the point. Next year, there will be the same people plus new people, but that's what we're trying to do. So, welcome. This is the standard. I've talked to this a lot today. What does empowerment look like? Again, the process of becoming stronger, more confident, especially in controlling one's life, claiming one's rights, and telling you guys empowerment is something you take is not something that is given to you. Just like that. We talked about responsibility, placing blame. I don't know. Sometimes reading some of the employee feedback can be a little frustrating, but every time we have these meetings, I like shouting at people. Am I saying, hey, this is your fault, it's your fault, it's your fault, or do I step up and do I put my name in front of the biggest challenge? Every time. Because my personal and the company's solution speed accelerates when that happens. Putting my name in front of every problem. Right here, just did it two weeks ago. Key reason, my performance, my decisions. I felt about this six months ago, three months ago. Messed up the bonus program in 2024 for communication. That's on me. Every time, my name is next to the biggest problems. It's the first thing. You guys remember this one? All of them. Just placing blame and taking responsibility. Same thing. Primary owner, 1A of all company problems. It's just my mentality. That's what I'm trying to shift with you all this week. Shift your mentality. Not just to this, but everything that we've been talking about. Same thing. You look at Ryan, what's Ryan's mentality? This is something the other week. I did not ensure the message he was as deliberate. That misfire is on me and me alone. Something Ryan wasn't even involved in. Same thing.\r\n\r\nMy vocabulary is a little weak. But like, 90 days of moving an aircraft carrier is awesome. That's called moving fast. It doesn't mean the day-to-day is pleasant always, but that's quick, quick, quick work. The question is though, is the job finished in ResyOps? Is there more work to do? I'm so angry. I have my YouTube situation. You're up 2-0. That's the story. Are you not happy? You're only half happy? Stay to be happy, Obama. You're up 2-0. Job's not finished. Job finished? I don't think so. Okay. Look at his stone cold. See that? Does he have a certain mentality? Right? That's what ResyOps' mentality needs to be for 2025. I don't care what the profit number looks like. Good, bad. Job's not finished. We are. Moving forward, we're being the best version of ourselves. By the way, guys, that's the same mentality for ResySales. Same mentality for our commercial business. Same mentality for everything. That's the mentality this year. That's the mentality this year. Job's not done. What the results look like. We're bringing the best every day. And everybody who's coming a year from now is going to look back and be like, You know what? I did the best work in my career last year. That's what we're getting to. It's not here and now. Anybody here? You want to be happy for an hour? Go have a steak. Go eat your favorite meal. You guys feel that? You'll be happy for a day. Go play golf. What else do you guys like to do for fun? Go fishing. Go hunting. Something like that. You'll be happy for a week. Take a vacation. You feel that? You'll be happy for a month. Go buy a new car. Buy something really big that you've been waiting on. A new car that'll make you feel good two years later. It kind of runs out on you. It's not sustainable. I'm telling you. If you just want to be happy, take responsibility and impact people. Seriously. Your parents probably understand that a little bit. Take responsibility and impact people. That's what I'm asking you all to do this year. I'm telling you. Your life, career, time, everything. Becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depth of responsibility you're willing to shoulder. We're talking about work, and we're talking about everything else. You guys feel that? You'll probably see it, too. This is what I mean when we talk about empowerment. Hopefully, I set out tonight for an immediate and permanent mentality shift. We'll talk a little bit about lunch, but ask yourself, what's your mentality today? Is it different from what it was two days ago? What's your mentality going to be every day this year? My mentality, for about a decade, I'm doing the best work in my career this year. That's unchanged. I'm asking you to do the same. That's it. Is your future worth the best part of your career? Appreciate you guys' time. Thank you.\nCan you analyze each of them for tone, content and meaning?  Are there any points in there that may not have been obvious upon first listening?  After that can you please compare and contrast the two?  And then combine all of them and suggest how I can do the best work of my career?  My linkedin profile is attached\n\r"

            "### **Analysis of the CRO\u2019s Speech**\n#### **Tone:**\n- **Conversational yet authoritative** \u2013 The CRO uses casual language (\u201cyou know,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s funny because\u2026\u201d) but maintains authority.\n- **Encouraging but urgent** \u2013 There is a balance between acknowledging past struggles and emphasizing the need for focused effort moving forward.\n- **Reflective and self-aware** \u2013 He acknowledges struggles in the company\u2019s commercial strategy and suggests that overcoming them will lead to success.\n\n#### **Content & Meaning:**\n- **Micro-accountability concept** \u2013 The CRO reframes accountability not as a trust issue but as a necessity for success.\n- **Vertical integration challenge** \u2013 He acknowledges that Lumina's approach to commercial solar (handling sales, project development, EPC, and labor) is more complex than competitors, but believes it will be an advantage.\n- **Backlog and brute effort** \u2013 There is a clear focus on rebuilding the backlog, implying that sales and administrative work are the immediate priorities.\n- **Personal involvement** \u2013 By mentioning that he personally sent emails and made calls, he sets an example of leadership through action.\n\n#### **Unobvious Takeaways:**\n- The CRO seems to be signaling to leadership that commercial solar remains a strategic focus despite its challenges.\n- There is an implied pressure on Mark and the commercial team to increase output quickly.\n- His emphasis on backlog suggests that cash flow or project pipeline might be under scrutiny from leadership.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of the CEO\u2019s Speech**\n#### **Tone:**\n- **Inspirational and philosophical** \u2013 He references sports analogies and personal responsibility to frame business struggles.\n- **Direct but not confrontational** \u2013 While he acknowledges employee frustrations, he doesn\u2019t shy away from his own accountability.\n- **Big-picture focused** \u2013 He looks beyond short-term struggles to long-term career and financial growth.\n\n#### **Content & Meaning:**\n- **Success is cumulative, not binary** \u2013 He rejects the idea of year-over-year failure, instead positioning struggles as necessary steps to success.\n- **Compensation philosophy** \u2013 He stresses that he prioritizes long-term earning potential over short-term fluctuations.\n- **Empowerment is self-driven** \u2013 Employees must take ownership of their success rather than waiting for permission or validation.\n- **Lumina as a leadership factory** \u2013 He sees the company as a place where people develop leadership skills that will serve them beyond their tenure.\n\n#### **Unobvious Takeaways:**\n- The CEO implicitly defends Lumina\u2019s pay structure, making it clear that while some people may feel undercompensated short-term, he believes the long-term financial benefits justify it.\n- His reference to responsibility being proportional to impact suggests that leaders should stop looking for external solutions and take ownership of problems.\n- His speech reinforces resilience and mental toughness, which could indicate that 2024 was a tough year financially or operationally.\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison of the Two Speeches**\n| **Aspect**       | **CRO\u2019s Speech** | **CEO\u2019s Speech** |\n|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Focus** | Immediate challenges (backlog, commercial strategy, accountability) | Long-term success, mindset, and leadership development |\n| **Tone** | Practical, urgent, and somewhat tactical | Philosophical, inspirational, and strategic |\n| **Key Message** | Commercial solar requires relentless effort to succeed | Struggles are stepping stones to greater career and financial success |\n| **Ownership** | Calls for micro-accountability at all levels | Frames responsibility as something to be taken, not assigned |\n| **Compensation View** | Implies the need for stronger performance to justify more resources | Emphasizes long-term career and financial gains over short-term changes |\n\n### **How to Do the Best Work of Your Career Based on These Lessons**\nFrom both speeches, a roadmap emerges on how you, **Mark Manthy**, can elevate your career performance:\n\n#### **1. Adopt Micro-Accountability**\n- Implement structured self-check-ins on sales performance and backlog management.\n- Take ownership of pipeline issues before leadership raises them.\n- Proactively communicate challenges with solutions, reinforcing trust.\n\n#### **2. Leverage Vertical Integration as a Selling Point**\n- Given that Lumina handles everything (sales, project development, EPC, labor), emphasize to clients why this model benefits them.\n- Develop case studies showcasing Lumina\u2019s ability to execute end-to-end projects successfully.\n\n#### **3. Prioritize High-Value Clients**\n- The CRO\u2019s backlog concern suggests selectivity is needed. Focus on closing deals that align with installation capacity and cash flow goals.\n\n#### **4. Think Long-Term in Compensation**\n- While pushing for higher earnings, align with leadership\u2019s perspective: prove your worth by securing deals that contribute to company-wide profitability.\n- Document financial wins that support arguments for improved sales structures.\n\n#### **5. Position Yourself as a Leadership Influence**\n- The CEO\u2019s vision of Lumina as a \u201cleadership factory\u201d means that developing people around you will increase your influence.\n- Mentor junior sales reps and offer strategic input to leadership on how to strengthen commercial sales.\n\n#### **6. Control the Narrative on Commercial Sales**\n- Leadership sees commercial solar as high-effort but essential. Provide clear, data-driven updates to show progress and mitigate concerns.\n- Suggest structured quarterly reviews with the CRO to refine commercial strategies.\n\n#### **7. Strengthen Resilience and Adaptability**\n- The CEO\u2019s emphasis on mental toughness means adapting to challenges with composure.\n- If 2024 was rough, frame your efforts in a way that showcases lessons learned and improvements for 2025.\n\n---\n\n### **Integrating This Into Your LinkedIn**\nYour **LinkedIn profile** already highlights your leadership, expertise, and impact in commercial solar. However, considering the leadership team's messaging, here are some optimizations:\n\n- **Emphasize resilience and problem-solving.** In your summary, add a line about thriving in complex, high-accountability environments.\n- **Showcase backlog rebuilding.** If possible, include metrics showing how you've contributed to commercial solar growth at Lumina.\n- **Align with the leadership factory theme.** Mention mentorship or training efforts that demonstrate leadership development within the company.\n\nWould you like me to draft a LinkedIn post summarizing your professional approach in line with these leadership themes?"

            "Here\u2019s a LinkedIn post that aligns with the leadership messages from your CRO and CEO while reinforcing your expertise and role in commercial solar. Feel free to tweak it to match your voice!\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udce2 The Best Work of My Career is Happening Now**  \n\n\"Job's not finished.\" That phrase stuck with me after our annual leadership retreat. It's not about celebrating too soon, nor about dwelling on challenges\u2014it's about committing to continuous improvement, day in and day out.  \n\nIn **commercial solar**, the road isn't easy. Unlike many in the industry, Lumina Solar takes on the full spectrum\u2014**sales, project development, EPC, and labor**\u2014a vertically integrated approach that most shy away from because of its complexity. But **that\u2019s exactly what makes us stronger.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Accountability is a mindset.** It\u2019s not about trust\u2014it\u2019s about ownership. Success isn\u2019t just about individual effort; it\u2019s about micro-accountability across the board. We all need to be in the trenches, ensuring that the backlog is growing, deals are closing, and projects are moving forward.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Compensation is a long game.** I believe in maximizing value\u2014for my team, our clients, and the business. Leadership sees compensation as a reflection of long-term impact, not just short-term gains. If we focus on **doing the best work of our careers**, the financial rewards will follow.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Leadership is a factory.** I see my role not just as a sales leader, but as someone who builds up those around me. Commercial solar is tough, but we succeed when we empower each other to think bigger, act decisively, and execute relentlessly.  \n\nThe takeaway? **We\u2019re building something that lasts.** Commercial solar at Lumina isn't just another division\u2014it's a key driver of our future success. The work we do today sets the foundation for the next decade.  \n\nIf you're in **commercial solar, project development, or financing**, I\u2019d love to connect. Let\u2019s push the industry forward, together.  \n\n#CommercialSolar #Leadership #Accountability #SolarEnergy #LuminaSolar #SalesLeadership #SolarDevelopment #JobNotFinished\n\n---\n\nThis hits the key themes from the retreat while reinforcing your leadership role. Would you like me to add anything more specific\u2014like a personal anecdote or project milestone?"
