            "Hey Mark,\n\nNavigating commission payouts during a job transition can be tricky, especially with pending litigations and a significant 401(k) loan on the line. Let's break this down:\n\n**Commission Payouts Amid Litigation:**\n\n\ue203Typically, commissions are considered earned once you've fulfilled all necessary conditions outlined in your commission agreement.\ue204 However, \ue203if a sale is embroiled in litigation, the finality of that sale\u2014and consequently, your commission\u2014might be in limbo until the dispute is resolved.\ue204 \ue203This means your employer could justifiably delay or withhold commission payments tied to those specific sales until the legal matters are settled.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Employer's Obligations Under Maryland Law:**\n\n\ue203In Maryland, commissions are classified as wages.\ue204 \ue203The Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law mandates that employers pay all wages due for work performed before termination.\ue204 \ue203Even if your employment ends, you're entitled to commissions for sales where you've completed all required tasks.\ue204 \ue203However, if the commission is contingent upon the successful completion of a sale, and that sale is under litigation, the commission may not be considered \"earned\" until the dispute is resolved.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n**Potential Employer Exemptions:**\n\n\ue203Employers might include clauses in commission agreements stating that commissions are payable only upon the company's receipt of payment from clients or upon the successful completion of a sale.\ue204 \ue203If a sale is in litigation, these conditions haven't been met, potentially releasing the employer from the obligation to pay those specific commissions until the issues are resolved.\ue204 \ue203Additionally, some agreements stipulate that employees must be actively employed at the time of commission payout.\ue204 \ue203However, Maryland courts have found such clauses unenforceable if the employee has already fulfilled all duties to earn the commission.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n1. **Review Your Commission Agreement:** \ue203Scrutinize the terms to understand when a commission is deemed \"earned\" and any conditions tied to payment.\ue204\ue206\n\n2. **Consult Legal Counsel:** \ue203Given the complexities\u2014especially with sales under litigation and your impending 401(k) loan repayment\u2014seeking advice from an employment attorney familiar with Maryland law is prudent.\ue204\ue206\n\n3. **Communicate with Your Employer:** \ue203Engage in a transparent discussion with your current employer about pending commissions to clarify payout timelines and any potential issues.\ue204\ue206\n\nTransitioning jobs is a significant move, and ensuring you receive all due compensation is crucial. \ue203Understanding your rights and obligations will empower you to make informed decisions during this period.\ue204\ue206 "

All information communicated shall be \n\nconsidered Confidential Information in the course of this relationship regardless of \n\nwhether disclosed visually, orally, in writing, or on electronic media.  \n\n            4.         Ownership of Intellectual Property:  \n\n(a) Assignment of Information; Retention of Rights and Remedies. Any inventions, \n\nimprovements, discoveries, developments, creations, words, logos, product design or \n\npackaging, designs, ideas, concepts, information, processes, know-how (whether or not \n\npatentable or confidential), and all intellectual property rights thereto (the \u201cIntellectual \n\nProperty\u201d), that the Employee conceives or first reduces to practice, either solely or \n\njointly with others, and that relate in any way to Employee\u2019s employment, is and shall be \n\nthe sole and exclusive property of the Company. Employee will promptly communicate \n\nto the Company any and all such Intellectual Property that he or she makes or conceives \n\nalone or jointly with others and deliver them to the Company. Employee hereby assigns \n\nto the Company Employee\u2019s entire right and interest in any and all such Intellectual \n\nProperty, whether or not patentable or confidential, that Employee may discover or \n\nconceive solely or jointly with others. Employee further agrees to sign any \n\ndocumentation, and deliver to the Company any and all drawings, notes, and \n\nspecifications necessary to evidence or effect this assignment and/or to apply for and/or \n\nobtain letters patent or other protection for such Intellectual Property, and agrees that \n\nthese obligations are binding upon Employee and his or her assigns, executors, \n\nadministrators and other legal representatives. The Company retains all rights and \n\nremedies afforded it under the patent, copyright, trade secret and other statutory and \n\ncommon laws of any relevant jurisdiction and country, including without limitation any \n\nlaws that protect the Company\u2019s Intellectual Property and/or Confidential Information.  \n\n(b) Copyright. In addition to and without limiting the foregoing Section 4(a), the \n\nEmployee also agrees that any copyrightable works of authorship that Employee \n\nproduces during or in connection with or in any way related to the employment of \n\nEmployee by the Company shall be deemed to be \u201cworks for hire\u201d and that the \n\nCompany shall be deemed the author thereof under the U.S. Copyright Act. In the event \n\nand to the extent such works are determined not to constitute \u201cworks for hire\u201d as a \n\nmatter of law, the Recipient hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to the Company all \n\nright, title and interest in such works, including but not limited to the copyrights thereof. \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nRecipient further agrees to sign any documentation, and deliver to the Company any and \n\nall drawings, notes, and specifications necessary to evidence or effect this assignment \n\nand/or to apply for and/or obtain registrations for such copyrights, and further agrees \n\nthat these obligations are binding upon Recipient\u2019s assigns, executors, administrators \n\nand other legal representatives.  \n\n            5.        Non-competition.  \n\n(a) Employee acknowledges and agrees that through his or her employment with the \n\nCompany, he or she will acquire a considerable amount of knowledge and goodwill with \n\nrespect to the business of the Company, which knowledge and goodwill are highly \n\nvaluable to the Company and which would be detrimental to the Company if used by \n\nEmployee to compete with the Company. Consequently, as material inducement for and \n\ncondition to the engagement of Employee as an employee of the Company pursuant to the \n\nterms of the Employee Offer Letter, Employee covenants and agrees that, while engaged \n\nby the Company and for one (1) year following the termination of Employee\u2019s \n\nemployment with the Company, Employee will not, without the prior written consent of \n\nthe Company, directly or indirectly, acting alone or as a member of a partnership, firm, \n\ncompany or other entity or as an investor in more than 1% of any solar related company: \n\nManage or control any solar business or entity that engages in activities that compete with \n\nthe Company\u2019s Business (as defined below); solicit for business customers of Lumina \n\nSolar, or potential Company customers that Lumina Solar has been or is soliciting; and \n\nsolicit any employees of Lumina Solar to resign their employment with the Company; to \n\nviolate any duties owed to the Company; or breach any agreements with the Company.  \n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the \u201cCompany\u2019s Business\u201d shall mean the residential \n\nand commercial solar sales and installation business and any other business in which the \n\nCompany and/or is subsidiaries or affiliates is actively engaged prior to the delivery of a \n\nnotice of termination by the Company or the Executive hereunder and which business the \n\nCompany is engaged at the Date of Termination of the Executive\u2019s employment.  \n\n(b) Should Employee violate any of the covenants contained in this Agreement and \n\nEmployer brings legal action for injunctive or other relief, Employer shall not, as a result \n\nof the time involved in obtaining relief, be deprived of the benefit of the full period of the \n\nrestrictive covenant. In addition, the term of all covenants and restrictions contained in this \n\nAgreement shall automatically be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time \n\nduring which Employee is in or is found to have been in violation of these covenants.  \n\n(c) Employee acknowledges that the Company\u2019s Business is largely conducted on \n\nand through computer networks, software and platforms, which have no meaningful \n\ngeographical boundaries or constraints and that, therefore, the absence of any specific \n\ngeographic designation with respect to the obligations under this Section 5 is appropriate \n\nand warranted under the circumstances. The parties hereto nevertheless agree that in the \n\nevent that the length of time, the geographic area or prohibited activities set forth in this \n\nSection 5 shall be deemed too restrictive in any court proceeding, that the court shall \n\nreduce such restrictions to those that the Court deems reasonable and enforceable under \n\nthe circumstances.  \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n6. Equitable Relief. Employee understands that, in the event Employee fails to comply with \n\nthe provisions of Section 3, 4 or 5 of this Agreement, the Company will suffer irreparable \n\ndamage that may not be compensated adequately by monetary damages. Accordingly, \n\nEmployee agrees that, in the event of Employee\u2019s breach or threatened breach of the terms \n\nof Section 3, 4 or 5, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive or other preliminary or \n\nequitable relief in addition to such other remedies as may be available to the Company for \n\nsuch breach or threatened breach, including damages.   \n\n7. Actions; Expenses. In the event of any action at law or in equity to enforce the \n\nprovisions of this Agreement, the unsuccessful party shall pay to the other all costs and \n\nexpenses so incurred, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.   \n\n8. Affiliated Companies. The term \u201cCompany\u201d shall include any of the Company\u2019s \n\nsubsidiaries, subdivisions or affiliates. The Company shall have the right to assign this  \n\nAgreement to its successors and assigns, and all covenants and agreements hereunder \n\nshall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said successors or assigns.   \n\n9. Survivability. Employee agrees and acknowledges that the Confidentiality and  \n\nNoncompetition obligations contained in this Agreement, and any other obligations of the \n\nEmployee hereunder which by their terms or by implication are to survive, shall survive \n\nbeyond the term of this Agreement and remain fully enforceable to the full extent of the \n\nlaw.   \n\n10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in \n\naccordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding that body of law known as \n\nchoice of law, and shall be binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and \n\nworldwide. All disputes with respect to this Agreement shall be brought and heard either \n\nin the Maryland state courts located in Howard County, or the federal district court for \n\nMaryland. The parties to this Agreement each consent to the in-person jurisdiction and \n\nvenue of such courts, and waive any objection they may have to such forums. The parties \n\nagree that service of process upon them in any such action may be made if delivered in \n\nperson, by courier service, by telegram, by facsimile or by first class mail, and shall be \n\ndeemed effectively given upon receipt.  \n\ni Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and \n\nunderstanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and \n\nsupersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, discussions and \n\nunderstandings of the parties, whether written or oral. Should any provision of this \n\nAgreement be determined to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by any \n\ncourt or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect the \n\nremaining provisions hereof which will remain in full force and effect. No waiver or \n\nmodification of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be valid unless in \n\nwriting and signed by both of the parties. Nothing herein shall be construed as an \n\noffer of, or the creation of a contract of, employment; rather this Agreement is being \n\nexecuted and delivered as an inducement to the employment by the Company of the \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nEmployee, the terms of which have been or will be determined by the Offer Letter or \n\nother arrangements between the Company and the Employee.   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound, the parties have executed  this \n\nAgreement as of the date first set forth above.  \n\n  \n\nEMPLOYEE             LUMINA SOLAR, INC. \n\n         \n\n  \n\n                     Mike Kirby, CEO & Co-Founder \n\nEmployee Name            Name and Title  \n\n \n\n          \nSignature  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSignature \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\nMark Manthy\n\n\n\t\t2024-02-08T13:31:23-0800\n\tDigitally verifiable PDF exported from www.docusign.com\n\n\n\n\n",

            "Based on your offer letter, here\u2019s what I found regarding your commission payout if you leave:\n\n### **What You\u2019re Owed Based on the Offer Letter:**\n1. **Commission Structure:**  \n   - You are entitled to 3% of the total sales price for any solar system you sell.\n   - **50% of the commission is earned at contract signing & deposit (or at Notice to Proceed for financed deals).**\n   - **The remaining 50% is earned at final payment to the company.**  \n   - **If a system is canceled, commissions may not be owed.**\n\n2. **Litigation Concerns:**  \n   - The contract doesn\u2019t specifically address what happens if a project is in litigation. However, since commissions are paid when the final payment is received, **if a project is stalled in litigation and the company hasn\u2019t received full payment, they could argue that the commission isn\u2019t due yet.**\n\n3. **Payout Upon Leaving:**  \n   - Your offer letter does *not* state that commissions are only paid while employed. This is **good news**\u2014it means that if you\u2019ve met the conditions for earning a commission, they likely still owe it to you.\n   - If a sale has **already reached final payment**, then you should be owed that commission no matter what.\n   - **If the project is pending or in litigation, they may try to delay or deny payment until resolved.**\n\n---\n\n### **Maryland Law & What They Are Required to Pay**\nMaryland law classifies commissions as wages when they are **earned.**  \n- If your commission has been fully earned (contract signed, deposit received, and final payment made to the company), **they must pay it to you even if you leave.**\n- **If the commission is not yet earned (pending final payment or under litigation), they may have grounds to withhold it.**\n- Maryland law prohibits employers from retroactively denying commissions already earned unless explicitly stated in the contract.\n\n**The Key Legal Question:**  \n- Did you complete all conditions to *earn* the commission?  \n- If so, even if you leave, they are required to pay.  \n- If not (like if the project is in dispute and final payment is pending), they might be able to delay or refuse it.\n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do Next:**\n1. **Make a List of Commissions You\u2019re Owed.**  \n   - Check which ones are fully earned (i.e., project completed, company paid).\n   - Check which ones are in litigation.\n\n2. **Request a Breakdown from Lumina Solar.**  \n   - Ask for a report of all commissions they owe you, including the status of each project.\n\n3. **Leverage Legal Pressure (If Necessary).**  \n   - Maryland Wage Payment laws favor employees, so if they\u2019re delaying payment unfairly, you *may* have a legal case.\n\n4. **Consider Negotiating a Lump-Sum Payout Before Leaving.**  \n   - If a lot of your commission is tied up in litigation, they *might* offer a lower but immediate payout to close it out.\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**\n- **If the company received full payment for a project, they must pay you your commission.**\n- **If a project is stalled in litigation, they may try to delay your payment indefinitely.**\n- **You should push for a clear payout agreement before leaving.**\n- **If they try to deny you commissions already earned, you may have a legal claim under Maryland labor law.**\n\nLet me know if you want to dig deeper into this. You might also want to get a quick consult from an employment lawyer to make sure you don\u2019t leave money on the table."

            "Correct. Based on your offer letter, **you are only entitled to commission once the contract is signed *and* the deposit is received (or, in the case of financed deals, at Notice to Proceed).**  \n\nIf you get a contract signed today but the deposit hasn\u2019t been received yet:  \n- **You have not \"earned\"** any commission under the terms of your agreement.  \n- **If you leave before the deposit is received, you likely forfeit that commission.**  \n\n### **Key Takeaways:**  \n- **Signed contract alone = No commission yet.**  \n- **Deposit received = 50% of commission earned.**  \n- **Final payment made to the company = Remaining 50% of commission earned.**  \n\nIf you\u2019re planning to leave soon, **you\u2019d want to push any pending customers to submit their deposits ASAP** so you can lock in at least half of the commission before your exit."

Purchaser acknowledges and understands that at the time it \nwishes to sell the Purchased Shares, the Company may not be satisfying the current public \ninformation requirement of Rule 144 or other conditions under Rule 144 which are required of the \nCompany and that it will be precluded from selling the Purchased Shares under Rule 144 even if \nthe one (1) year holding period of Rule 144 has been satisfied. \n\n(c) No Intent to Resell or Distribute the Purchased Shares.  \nPurchaser is acquiring the Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder for Purchaser\u2019s own account \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nand for investment only and not with a view to resale or distribution.  Purchaser is prepared to hold \nthe Purchased Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder for an indefinite period and has no \npresent intention to sell, distribute or grant any participating interests in such Purchased Shares.  \nPurchaser does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to \nsell, transfer, or grant participating interests to such person or to any third person, with respect to \nany of the Purchased Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder. \n\n(d) Domicile/Principal Place of Business.  Purchaser resides in the \nstate and country identified in the address of Purchaser set forth below.  \n\n(e) Transfers and Dispositions.

            "### **Can You Cash Out Your $10,000 Investment in Lumina Solar?**\nYour **investment details**:\n- You purchased **159,871 shares** at **$0.06255 per share** under the **Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)**.\n- The purchase was made under **a Stockholders Agreement**, which likely **restricts when and how you can sell your shares**.\n\n### **Can You Take It Out?**\nNot easily. Your stock is **not publicly traded**, meaning you **can\u2019t just sell it on the open market**. Instead, your options depend on:\n1. **Stockholders Agreement Restrictions** \u2013 The agreement likely limits your ability to sell or transfer shares.\n2. **Company Buyback Policy** \u2013 Some companies allow buybacks, but there\u2019s no mention of that in the purchase document.\n3. **Finding a Private Buyer** \u2013 You *might* be able to sell to another investor, but you\u2019d need company approval.\n4. **Company Liquidity Event (IPO, Acquisition, Merger)** \u2013 If Lumina Solar gets acquired or goes public, you could cash out.\n\n### **What Is It Worth?**\n- You paid **$0.06255 per share** in **December 2022**.\n- **Has the company\u2019s valuation increased?** If yes, your shares *may* be worth more.\n- If **no one is buying shares**, or if the company won\u2019t repurchase them, your shares are essentially *illiquid* (i.e., stuck in the company).\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Check the Stockholders Agreement** \u2013 It will tell you your rights to sell and if the company has any obligation to buy back.\n2. **Ask Lumina Solar** \u2013 Does the company offer share buybacks? Are there any recent transactions setting a new share price?\n3. **Get a Valuation** \u2013 If there\u2019s no buyback program, you\u2019d need to determine if anyone would buy your shares.\n\n**Bottom Line:** You can\u2019t just \"withdraw\" your investment like a bank account. You need to **sell your shares**, but restrictions apply. Your best bet is seeing if the company will buy them back or if another investor is interested. Let me know if you want to dig deeper into the Stockholders Agreement!"

            "Possibly\u2014but not necessarily in a straightforward way. Revenue growth is a good sign, but it doesn\u2019t directly determine the value of your shares unless there\u2019s an official valuation event (like a funding round, acquisition, or public offering). Here\u2019s how it might impact your stock value:  \n\n### **Factors That Affect Your Stock Value**  \n\n1. **Increased Revenue \u2260 Increased Valuation (Automatically)**  \n   - Revenue growth from **$40M (2022) to $70M (2024)** is strong, but **profitability matters more**.  \n   - If Lumina\u2019s costs also increased significantly, its **net income** or EBITDA might not have improved much.  \n\n2. **Company Valuation and Multiples**  \n   - Private companies are often valued based on **Revenue Multiples** or **EBITDA Multiples**.  \n   - If solar companies in a similar market are valued at **1.5x revenue**, Lumina\u2019s valuation might have gone from:\n     - **$40M revenue \u00d7 1.5x = $60M valuation (2022)**\n     - **$70M revenue \u00d7 1.5x = $105M valuation (2024)**  \n   - If Lumina has **raised money recently**, they might have a new valuation based on investor terms.  \n\n3. **Your Ownership Percentage**  \n   - The company\u2019s total number of shares outstanding matters.  \n   - If they issued **new shares** to investors or employees, your ownership percentage **may have diluted**, meaning your shares would be worth less per share even if the company\u2019s total value increased.  \n\n4. **Liquidity & Exit Strategy**  \n   - Your stock value **only becomes real when you can sell it**\u2014if Lumina is private and there\u2019s **no buyer, it\u2019s still illiquid.**  \n   - If Lumina is planning an **exit event (sale, IPO, buyout, or new investors), you might get an updated valuation.**  \n\n### **What Can You Do?**  \n- **Ask if the company has a recent valuation** (e.g., if they raised money, they likely set a new share price).  \n- **Check your percentage ownership** to see if your stake was diluted.  \n- **See if there\u2019s a buyback program or secondary market** for shares.  \n\nIf Lumina has truly **increased in value**, your shares *might* be worth more\u2014but unless you can sell them or the company offers a liquidity event, the value is just theoretical for now."

            "Yes, there are scenarios where you could lose your investment or end up with worthless shares. Here\u2019s what to watch out for:  \n\n### **1. No Buyer / No Liquidity**  \n- Your stock is **not publicly traded**, meaning you can\u2019t just sell it whenever you want.  \n- If **no one is willing to buy your shares**, they\u2019re effectively **worthless until a liquidity event happens** (buyout, acquisition, or IPO).  \n\n### **2. Company Issues More Shares (Dilution)**  \n- If Lumina **raises more money and issues new shares**, your percentage ownership **shrinks** unless you invest more.  \n- Example: If Lumina was originally worth $60M and you owned **0.1%**, but then they **raise money and the valuation jumps to $100M**, your percentage could shrink if they issue new shares to investors.  \n\n### **3. Company Goes Bankrupt or Fails**  \n- If Lumina **shuts down** or **gets acquired at a low valuation**, your shares could become worthless.  \n- In a **bankruptcy or fire sale**, investors (especially common stockholders like you) are **last in line** to get paid\u2014after lenders, creditors, and preferred shareholders.  \n\n### **4. Stockholder Agreement Restrictions**  \n- Your stockholder agreement **may prevent you from selling shares** without company approval.  \n- If they have a **right of first refusal (ROFR)**, they can block outside buyers.  \n\n### **5. Forced Buyback at Low Price**  \n- Some agreements allow companies to **buy back your shares at the original price or a pre-determined price**, even if the company has grown in value.  \n- If there\u2019s a clause like this, **you could get forced out at a loss or no gain**.  \n\n### **How to Protect Yourself:**  \n- **Read the Stockholders Agreement** \u2013 Look for terms on **buybacks, dilution, and selling restrictions**.  \n- **Ask Lumina if they have a valuation update** \u2013 They may have an internal share price if they raised money recently.  \n- **Check for a buyout clause** \u2013 Some companies allow you to sell back shares (but sometimes at a disadvantageous price).  \n- **Stay informed about company financials** \u2013 If they\u2019re struggling, you may want to push for a way to cash out.  \n\n### **Bottom Line:**  \nYou don\u2019t automatically lose your shares, but their value **depends on the company\u2019s future**. If Lumina thrives, your investment could be worth more, but if they fail or restrict share sales, you could get stuck with nothing.  \n\nWant me to go deeper into any specific risk?"

            "That\u2019s good news\u2014profitability at least means the company is sustainable. But if the profit margins were slim, it **doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your shares have increased in value or that you can cash out easily.** Here\u2019s what that means for you:  \n\n### **What a Small Profit Means for Your Investment:**  \n1. **The Company Isn\u2019t at Immediate Risk of Failing**  \n   - As long as they\u2019re profitable (even by a small margin), **they\u2019re not burning cash** and relying on debt or outside funding.  \n   - However, if profitability is razor-thin, they may **need to raise money in the future**, which could dilute your shares.  \n\n2. **Your Stock Value May Not Have Increased Much**  \n   - Investors typically look at **profit growth**, not just revenue.  \n   - If profit margins were small, **investors wouldn\u2019t necessarily assign a higher valuation to Lumina.**  \n   - Example: A $70M revenue company with $1M in profit might **not** be much more valuable than a $40M revenue company with $500K in profit.  \n\n3. **No Pressure to Sell or Raise Money (Yet)**  \n   - If Lumina was **losing money**, they\u2019d likely have to raise capital soon, which could dilute you.  \n   - Since they are **profitable, even slightly, they don\u2019t need to take on investors right away**\u2014which means no immediate opportunity for you to cash out.  \n\n4. **Dividends Are Unlikely**  \n   - **If profits were small, they probably aren\u2019t paying dividends.**  \n   - This means your **only way to get value is if the company sells, goes public, or buys back shares.**  \n\n---\n\n### **How Can You Get Your Money Out?**  \nSince Lumina is still private, you **can\u2019t just sell your shares on the open market.** But here are your options:  \n\n#### **1. Check if the Company Has a Buyback Program**  \n   - Some private companies allow employees/investors to **sell shares back to the company** (often at a lower price).  \n   - You need to check if Lumina has ever done this before.  \n\n#### **2. Find a Private Buyer (If Allowed)**  \n   - Your **Stockholders Agreement may restrict this**, but if you can sell to another investor, you might be able to cash out.  \n   - Some companies have **internal marketplaces** for trading shares\u2014does Lumina have one?  \n\n#### **3. Wait for a Liquidity Event (Sale or IPO)**  \n   - If Lumina eventually **sells to another company** or **goes public**, you\u2019d finally have a way to cash out.  \n   - This is the most **profitable option** but could take years.  \n\n#### **4. Push for More Transparency**  \n   - If you\u2019re serious about getting your money out, **ask leadership about future funding or exit plans**.  \n   - If they plan to raise capital, **you could use that as an opportunity to sell.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line:**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **Your investment is safe (for now) since the company is profitable.**  \n\u26a0\ufe0f **Your shares might not be worth much more than when you bought them.**  \n\ud83d\udeaa **Getting your money out will be difficult unless there\u2019s a buyback, a sale, or a major investor willing to buy you out.**  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- **Check the Stockholders Agreement for buyback/sale restrictions.**  \n- **Ask Lumina about valuation updates and future liquidity plans.**  \n- **See if any investors/employees want to buy your shares.**  \n\nWant me to take a deeper look at your Stockholders Agreement to see if you have a way out?"

This agreement likely outlines:  \n\n- **Restrictions on selling your shares** (who you can sell to, if at all)  \n- **Company rights to buy back shares** (sometimes at a low price)  \n- **What happens if you leave the company**  \n- **What happens if the company is sold or raises more money**  \n\nSince that document isn't in what you've uploaded, you'll need to **get a copy of the Stockholders Agreement from Lumina** to know your exact rights.  \n\n**Next steps:**  \n1. **Ask Lumina for a copy of the Stockholders Agreement** (if you don\u2019t already have one).  \n2. **Look for sections about transfers, buybacks, and exits.**  \n3. **If needed, I can help you break it down once you have it.**  \n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to it, you could also ask leadership **if the company has done any share buybacks or if any investors/employees have sold shares recently**\u2014that would give you a clue about how much flexibility you have."

            "### **Can You Sell or Cash Out Your Shares?**\nFrom reviewing your **Invitation to Purchase Common Stock**, you are bound by the **Stockholders Agreement**, which includes significant restrictions on transferring or selling your shares. Here\u2019s what that means for you:  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways from Your Agreement**\n1. **You Cannot Freely Sell Your Shares**  \n   - Your shares are **subject to the Stockholders Agreement** and **cannot be transferred without company approval**.  \n   - You likely **need permission from Lumina** before selling them to an external buyer.  \n\n2. **Company May Have First Rights to Buy Your Shares**  \n   - Many private stock agreements include a **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**, meaning Lumina **gets the first chance to buy your shares before you sell to someone else**.  \n   - If this is in the Stockholders Agreement, **they can block you from selling to outside investors**.  \n\n3. **Shares Are Illiquid Unless There\u2019s a Buyback or Exit Event**  \n   - There\u2019s **no public market** for Lumina stock, so **you can\u2019t sell them easily**.  \n   - You need either:  \n     - A **buyback program from the company**  \n     - A **private buyer (if permitted under the Stockholders Agreement)**  \n     - The company to go **public or get acquired**  \n\n4. **Your Shares Are Not Registered with the SEC**  \n   - The document states your shares are **not registered under securities laws**, meaning they are **restricted from public sale**.  \n   - Even if you find a buyer, **you may need legal approval to transfer them**.  \n\n5. **You May Be Stuck Holding Them Until an Exit**  \n   - If Lumina **gets acquired or goes public**, your shares would convert into cash or publicly traded stock.  \n   - Until then, you\u2019re **likely locked in unless the company offers a buyback**.  \n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do Next**\n\u2705 **Request a Copy of the Full Stockholders Agreement**  \n   - Your purchase agreement **mentions the Stockholders Agreement, but does not include it.**  \n   - This document will outline:  \n     - **Who can buy your shares**  \n     - **If there\u2019s a company buyback option**  \n     - **If there are exit triggers (acquisition, IPO, etc.)**  \n\n\u2705 **Ask Lumina If They Have a Buyback Program**  \n   - Some private companies offer **to repurchase employee shares** at a set price.  \n   - **If they do, they may offer you a way to cash out.**  \n\n\u2705 **Check If Any Investors or Employees Want to Buy Your Shares**  \n   - If the Stockholders Agreement allows, **you may be able to sell shares to another employee or investor.**  \n   - Lumina might need to approve the sale.  \n\n\u2705 **See If the Company Has Raised Money Recently**  \n   - If Lumina raised funds recently, there might be a **new valuation** that sets a share price.  \n   - This would help determine **what your shares are worth today.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**\n\u2714\ufe0f You **still own the shares**, but you **can\u2019t cash out easily**.  \n\u2714\ufe0f You **likely need company approval to sell**.  \n\u2714\ufe0f Your shares are **worth something only if Lumina grows or gets acquired**.  \n\u2714\ufe0f To get clarity, **you need the full Stockholders Agreement** and to **ask Lumina about buybacks or recent valuations.**  \n\nLet me know if you want help drafting an email to Lumina asking about your options!"
