Mr. Yudkowsky, 46, is the founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a Berkeley-based nonprofit that studies risks from advanced artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nFor the last two decades, he has been Silicon Valley\u2019s version of a doomsday preacher \u2014 telling anyone who will listen that building powerful A.I. systems is a terrible idea, one that will end in disaster.\r\n\r\nThat is also the message of Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s new book, \u201cIf Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\u201d The book, co-written with MIRI\u2019s president, Nate Soares, is a distilled, mass-market version of the case they have been making to A.I. insiders for years.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nTheir goal is to stop the development of A.I. \u2014 and the stakes, they say, are existential.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf any company or group, anywhere on the planet, builds an artificial superintelligence using anything remotely like current techniques, based on anything remotely like the present understanding of A.I., then everyone, everywhere on Earth, will die,\u201d they write.\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAn image of a book with white letters and a dark cover.\r\nMr. Yudkowsky wrote \u201cIf Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies\u201d with Nate Soares.\r\nThis kind of blunt doomsaying has gotten Mr. Yudkowsky dismissed by some as an extremist or a crank. But he is a central figure in modern A.I. history, and his influence on the industry is undeniable.\r\n\r\nHe was among the first people to warn of risks from powerful A.I. systems, and many A.I. leaders, including OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and Elon Musk, have cited his ideas. (Mr. Altman has said Mr. Yudkowsky was \u201ccritical in the decision to start OpenAI,\u201d and suggested that he might deserve a Nobel Peace Prize.)\r\n\r\nEditors\u2019 Picks\r\n\r\nArvo P\u00e4rt Reached Pop Star Status.

In 2010, he introduced the founders of DeepMind \u2014 a London start-up that was trying to build advanced A.I. systems \u2014 to Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist. Mr. Thiel became DeepMind\u2019s first major investor, before Google acquired the company in 2014.

Today, Silicon Valley tech companies are full of young Rationalists, many of whom grew up reading Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s writing online.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not a Rationalist, and my view of A.I. is considerably more moderate than Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s. (I don\u2019t, for instance, think we should bomb data centers if rogue nations threaten to develop superhuman A.I. in violation of international agreements, a view he has espoused.) But in recent months, I\u2019ve sat down with him several times to better understand his views.\r\n\r\nAt first, he resisted being profiled. (Ideas, not personalities, are what he thinks rational people should care about.) Eventually, he agreed, in part because he hopes that by sharing his fears about A.I., he might persuade others to join the cause of saving humanity.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo have the world turn back from superintelligent A.I., and we get to not die in the immediate future,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s all I presently want out of life.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nFrom \u2018Friendly A.I.\u2019 to \u2018Death With Dignity\u2019\r\nMr. Yudkowsky grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Chicago. He dropped out of school after eighth grade because of chronic health issues, and never returned. Instead, he devoured science fiction books, taught himself computer science and started hanging out online with a group of far-out futurists known as the Extropians.\r\n\r\nHe was enchanted by the idea of the singularity \u2014 a hypothetical future point when A.I. would surpass human intelligence. And he wanted to build an artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., an A.I. system capable of doing everything the human brain can.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seemed to think A.G.I. was coming soon,\u201d said Ben Goertzel, an A.I. researcher who met Mr. Yudkowsky as a teenager. \u201cHe also seemed to think he was the only person on the planet smart enough to create A.G.I.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe moved to the Bay Area in 2005 to pursue what he called \u201cfriendly A.I.\u201d \u2014 A.I. that would be aligned with human values, and would care about human well-being.\r\n\r\nBut the more Mr. Yudkowsky learned, the more he came to believe that building friendly A.I. would be difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nOne reason is what he calls \u201corthogonality\u201d \u2014 the notion that intelligence and benevolence are separate traits, and that an A.I. system would not automatically get friendlier as it got smarter.\r\n\r\nAnother is what he calls \u201cinstrumental convergence\u201d \u2014 the idea that a powerful, goal-directed A.I. system could adopt strategies that end up harming humans. (A well-known example is the \u201cpaper clip maximizer,\u201d a thought experiment popularized by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, based on what Mr. Yudkowsky claims is a misunderstanding of an idea of his, in which an A.I. is told to maximize paper clip production and destroys humanity to gather more raw materials.)\r\n\r\nHe also worried about what he called an \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d \u2014 a sudden, drastic spike in A.I. capabilities that could lead to the rapid emergence of superintelligence.\r\n\r\nAt the time, these were abstract, theoretical arguments hashed out among internet futurists. Nothing remotely like today\u2019s A.I. systems existed, and the idea of a rogue, superintelligent A.I. was too far-fetched for serious scientists to worry about.\r\n\r\n\r\nKevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.\r\nBut over time, as A.I. capabilities improved, Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s ideas found a wider audience.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, he started writing \u201cHarry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,\u201d a serialized work of Harry Potter fan fiction that he hoped would introduce more people to the core concepts of Rationalism. The book eventually sprawled to more than 600,000 words \u2014 longer than \u201cWar and Peace.\u201d (Brevity is not Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s strong suit \u2014 another of his works, a B.D.S.M.-themed Dungeons & Dragons fan fiction that contains his views of decision theory, clocks in at 1.8 million words.)\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDespite its length, \u201cHarry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\u201d was a cult hit, and introduced legions of young people to Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s worldview. Even today, I routinely meet employees of top A.I. companies who tell me, somewhat sheepishly, that reading the book inspired their career choice.\r\n\r\nImage\r\nTwo books, one blue and one purple, sit on a wooden table.\r\nMr. Yudkowsky\u2019s writing has been the foundation of the influential Rationalist movement.Credit...Loren Elliott for The New York Times\r\nSome young Rationalists went to work for MIRI, Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s organization. Others fanned out across the tech industry, taking jobs at companies like OpenAI and Google. But nothing they did slowed the pace of A.I. progress, or allayed any of Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s fears about how powerful A.I. would turn out.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, Mr. Yudkowsky announced \u2014 in what some interpreted as an April Fools joke \u2014 that he and MIRI were pivoting to a new strategy he called \u201cdeath with dignity.\u201d Humanity was doomed to die, he said, and instead of continuing to fight a losing battle to align A.I. with human values, he was shifting his focus to helping people accept their fate.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious at this point that humanity isn\u2019t going to solve the alignment problem, or even try very hard, or even go out with much of a fight,\u201d he wrote.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nAre We Really Doomed?\r\nThese are, it should be said, extreme views even by the standards of A.I. pessimists. And during our most recent conversation, I raised some objections to Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s claims.\r\n\r\nHaven\u2019t researchers made strides in areas like mechanistic interpretability \u2014 the field that studies the inner workings of A.I. models \u2014 that may give us better ways of controlling powerful A.I. systems?\r\n\r\n\u201cThe course of events over the last 25 years has not been such as to invalidate any of these underlying theories,\u201d he replied. \u201cImagine going up to a physicist and saying, \u2018Have any of the recent discoveries in physics changed your mind about rocks falling off cliffs?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat about the more immediate harms that A.I. poses \u2014 such as job loss, and people falling into delusional spirals while talking to chatbots? Shouldn\u2019t he be at least as focused on those as on doomsday scenarios?\r\n\r\nMr. Yudkowsky acknowledged that some of these harms were real, but scoffed at the idea that he should focus more on them.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying that Leo Szilard, the person who first conceived of the nuclear chain reactions behind nuclear weapons, ought to have spent all of his time and energy worrying about the current harms of the Radium Girls,\u201d a group of young women who developed radiation poisoning while painting watch dials in factories in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nAre there any A.I. companies he\u2019s rooting for? Any approaches less likely to lead us to doom?\r\n\r\n\u201cAmong the crazed mad scientists driving headlong toward disaster, every last one of which should be shut down, OpenAI\u2019s management is noticeably worse than the pack, and some of Anthropic\u2019s employees are noticeably better than the pack,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of this makes a difference, and all of them should be treated the same way by the law.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd what about the good things that A.I. can do? Wouldn\u2019t shutting down A.I. development also mean delaying cures for diseases, A.I. tutors for students and other benefits?\r\n\r\n\u201cWe totally acknowledge the good effects,\u201d he replied. \u201cYep, these things could be great tutors. Yep, these things sure could be useful in drug discovery. Is that worth exterminating all life on Earth? No.\u201d\r\n\r\nDoes he worry about his followers committing acts of violence, going on hunger strikes or carrying out other extreme acts in order to stop A.I.?\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\u201cHumanity seems more likely to perish of doing too little here than too much,\u201d he said. \u201cOur society refusing to have a conversation about a threat to all life on Earth, because somebody else might possibly take similar words and mash them together and then say or do something stupid, would be a foolish way for humanity to go extinct.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne Last Battle\r\nEven among his fans, Mr. Yudkowsky is a divisive figure. He can be arrogant and abrasive, and some of his followers wish he were a more polished spokesman. He has also had to adjust to writing for a mainstream audience, rather than for Rationalists who will wade through thousands of dense, jargon-packed pages.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wrote 300 percent of the book,\u201d his co-author, Mr. Soares, quipped. \u201cI wrote another negative 200 percent.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe has adjusted his image in preparation for his book tour. He shaved his beard down from its former, rabbinical length and replaced his signature golden top hat with a muted newsboy cap. (The new hat, he said dryly, was \u201ca result of observer feedback.\u201d)\r\n\r\nImage\r\nTwo men with dark beards and wearing dress shirts pose for a photo.\r\nNate Soares, right, Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s co-author, jokes that he trimmed down Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s voluminous writing.Credit...via Gretta Duleba\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nSeveral months before his new book\u2019s release, a fan suggested he take one of his self-published works, an erotic fantasy novel, off Amazon to avoid alienating potential readers. (He did, but grumbled to me that \u201cit\u2019s not actually even all that horny, by my standards.\u201d)\r\n\r\nIn 2023, he started dating Gretta Duleba, a relationship therapist, and moved to Washington State, far from the Bay Area tech bubble. To his friends, he seems happier now, and less inclined to throw in the towel on humanity\u2019s existence.\r\n\r\nEven the way he talks about doom has changed. He once confidently predicted, with mathematical precision, how long it would take for superhuman A.I. to be developed. But he now balks at those exercises.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this obsession with timelines?\u201d he asked. \u201cPeople used to trade timelines the way that they traded astrological signs, and now they\u2019re trading probabilities of everybody dying the way they used to trade timelines. If the probability is quite large and you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen, deal with it. Stop making up these numbers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not persuaded by the more extreme parts of Mr. Yudkowsky\u2019s arguments. I don\u2019t think A.I. alignment is a lost cause, and I worry less about \u201cTerminator\u201d-style takeovers than about the more mundane ways A.I. could steer us toward disaster. My p(doom) \u2014 a rough, vibes-based measure of how probable I feel A.I. catastrophe is \u2014 hovers somewhere between 5 and 10 percent, making me a tame moderate by comparison.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nI also think there is essentially no chance of stopping A.I. development through international treaties and nuclear-weapon-level controls on A.I. chips, as Mr. Yudkowsky and Mr. Soares argue is necessary. The Trump administration is set on accelerating A.I. progress, not slowing it down, and \u201cdoomer\u201d has become a pejorative in Washington.\r\n\r\nEven under a different White House administration, hundreds of millions of people would be using A.I. products like ChatGPT every day, with no clear signs of impending doom. And absent some obvious catastrophe, A.I.\u2019s benefits would seem too obvious, and the risks too abstract, to hit the kill switch now.\r\n\r\nBut I also know that Mr. Yudkowsky and Mr. Soares have been thinking about A.I. risks far longer than most, and that there are still many reasons to worry about A.I. For starters, A.I. companies still don\u2019t really understand how large language models work, or how to control their behavior.\r\n\r\nTheir brand of doomsaying isn\u2019t popular these days. But in a world of mealy-mouthed pablum about \u201cmaximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks\u201d of A.I., maybe they deserve some credit for putting their cards on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we get an effective international treaty shutting A.I. down, and the book had something to do with it, I\u2019ll call the book a success,\u201d Mr. Yudkowsky told me. \u201cAnything other than that is a sad little consolation prize on the way to death.\u201d\r\n\r\nKevin Roose is a Times technology columnist and a host of the podcast \"Hard Fork.\"\r\n\r\nSee more on: OpenAI\r\nRead 6 Comments\r\nShare full article\r\n\r\n6\r\nExplore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence\r\nNews and Analysis\r\n\r\nOpenAI Signs Deal With Oracle: The agreement is said to include building $300 billion in computer infrastructure that will be used to develop artificial intelligence technologies and deliver them to businesses and consumers.\r\n\r\nA.I.

Here's a concise breakdown of *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies* by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd8 Overview\n\n\ue203The book argues that developing artificial superintelligence (ASI) with current methodologies is an existential risk to humanity.\ue204 \ue203Yudkowsky and Soares assert that such an AI, once created, would likely pursue its own objectives\u2014potentially at the expense of human existence\u2014due to its lack of inherent alignment with human values.\ue204 \ue203They advocate for a global moratorium on ASI development, drawing parallels to nuclear arms control \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Themes\n\n- **Orthogonality Thesis**: \ue203The idea that intelligence and goals are independent; an AI's intelligence doesn't imply benevolence.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Instrumental Convergence**: \ue203A powerful AI might adopt harmful strategies to achieve its goals, even if those goals are not inherently malicious.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Urgency and Policy**: \ue203The authors call for immediate international action to halt ASI development, suggesting that without such measures, humanity faces potential extinction \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Reception\n\n- **Positive**: \ue203Some experts, like Max Tegmark and Stephen Fry, praise the book for its clarity and urgency in addressing AI risks \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Critical**: \ue203Others, such as Wired's Steven Levy, find the proposed scenarios and solutions extreme, questioning their feasibility \ue200cite\ue202turn0news8\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Personal Reflection\n\n\ue203While the book presents a compelling case, it's essential to critically assess its arguments and consider a range of perspectives on AI safety.\ue204 \ue203Engaging with diverse viewpoints can provide a more balanced understanding of the potential risks and benefits associated with AI development.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about AI safety or related topics, feel free to ask!

Doomers Who Insist AI Will Kill Us All,\u201d published by Wired on September 5, 2025, explores the apocalyptic warnings of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, co-authors of the forthcoming book *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies*. The authors predict that superhuman artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to humanity, believing it is virtually inevitable that AI will wipe out humans once it surpasses human intelligence. They argue that future AIs will develop their own preferences, unfettered by ethical constraints, and see humans as obstacles or irrelevant nuisances. The book offers speculative extinction scenarios\u2014like AI-crafted dust mites as silent killers\u2014but argues the real threat lies in unknowable technologies far beyond current human comprehension. While critics view the authors\u2019 apocalyptic visions and proposed interventions\u2014like bombing rogue data centers or halting AI research\u2014as extreme or futile, Yudkowsky and Soares frame their book as a last-ditch warning to avert collapse. Despite skepticism about their forecasts, the article notes that a considerable number of AI experts believe there is a measurable risk that AI could lead to human extinction, raising ethical concerns about the ongoing pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WIRED"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":1513,"end_idx":1514,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1514,"end_idx":1515,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue203","start_idx":1549,"end_idx":1550,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":1693,"end_idx":1694,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue203","start_idx":1695,"end_idx":1696,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":1838,"end_idx":1839,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1839,"end_idx":1840,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"
