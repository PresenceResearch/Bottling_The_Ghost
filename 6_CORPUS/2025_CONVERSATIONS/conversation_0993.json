Google Drive = Document Vault**\n- Script (or Zapier): when Airtable lead is created, auto-create a Drive folder with naming convention  \n  e.g. `2025-10-06_RedlandBaptist_PPA`\n\n### **3. Aurora Solar = Stays External, Just Link It**\n- Keep using it \u2014 just paste in the project link.\n- (Eventually could use API, but not yet.)\n\n### **4. WhatsApp Price Request = Needs Formalization**\n- Either:\n  - Use a shared Airtable pricing table\n  - Or set a Slack/Notion template for pricing request form\n\nLet\u2019s *standardize that price request.* It\u2019s too fragile right now.\n\n### **5. Proposal Generator = Google Doc Template + Fillers**\n- You feed it:\n  - Customer Name\n  - System Size\n  - Estimated Production\n  - Price / PPA Rate\n  - Any SREC info\n- Auto-fills proposal and saves as PDF in the Drive folder\n- Can trigger from Airtable row update\n\n### **6.
