So you don\u2019t have to rely on, say, Google Photos or iCloud. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **Metadata + search**: EXIF, location, object detection, face clustering. This means you can find \u201call solar-site photos in Maryland, last quarter\u201d or \u201call installation photos with cable type X\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- **Self-hosted architecture**: You control the server, storage, security, network. So you define backup patterns, data retention, access.  \n- **Multi-user support & sharing**: You can share albums with colleagues or clients while keeping control over the server. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Ongoing improvements**: For example, recent version adds OCR (so images with text can be searchable) and improved duplicate review tools. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### Things to watch / potential challenges  \n- **Setup overhead**: Self-hosting means you\u2019ll need server infrastructure (even a NAS or VM), storage capacity, backup plan. The project warns: \u201c\u26a0\ufe0f Expect bugs and breaking changes. Do not use the app as the only way to store your photos and videos.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **Backup strategy important**: You\u2019ll want to implement something like a 3-2-1 backup strategy (local + offsite) even though you host yourself.  \n- **Resource usage**: If you enable advanced features (face/object detection, OCR, large video transcoding), you may need decent hardware (or accept performance trade-offs).  \n- **Maintenance**: Upgrading versions, monitoring service, handling data growth \u2014 requires operational discipline.  \n- **Feature gaps vs big cloud providers**: While rich, it may lack some editing features (heavy photo editing, cloud-AI enhancements) compared to commercial services. Some user reviews note missing photo editor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Security & access control**: If you open remote access (outside your LAN), you must manage authentication, encryption, firewall. Your role in solar sales & data may impose certain compliance/security expectations.\n\n---\n\n### Use-Case Recommendation for You  \nGiven your profile (systems builder, researcher, looking at machine/human connection, and likely dealing with many photos/videos in solar installations), here\u2019s a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Pilot install** on modest hardware (e.g., a small server or even a VM) and mirror a subset of your photo library (say installation photos). Use this to test: upload workflow, search by metadata, extracting value.  \n2. **Define metadata schema**: For your installation context, decide how you tag: site number, module type, date, installer, image type (pre-install, post-install, maintenance). Leverage Immich\u2019s metadata/search rather than treating it as generic photo dump.  \n3. **Integrate with workflow**: For example, after a site visit, automatically upload images via mobile app; then tag/album them; later run search queries for analytics (e.g., \u201cmodule brand X defects\u201d).  \n4. **Link to your \u201crelational presence\u201d research**: Consider how this system supports memory/trace of installations, acts as digital presence of field sites, and how human/team interactions with this media play out (who sees, tags, comments).  \n5. **Backup + retention policy**: Because you\u2019re self-hosting, decide how long you keep files, how you archive offsite (e.g., cold storage), and how you protect from hardware failure.  \n6. **Evaluate scalability**: As number of assets grow, test performance of search, indexing, storage cost. Decide whether to keep some in cold archive vs active.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can **pull together an installation & architecture guide** for Immich (with recommended hardware specs, Docker or Kubernetes setup, backup strategy) tailored for your field-use (mobile uploads, remote sites).
