The incident involved at least 24 harmful extensions discovered in the Visual Studio Marketplace and the Open VSX Registry\u2014platforms for distributing VS Code-compatible editor extensions. The malicious extensions, attributed to a threat actor dubbed \"WhiteCobra,\" deploy the Lumma Stealer on Windows systems, which can extract passwords, payment data, session cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet information. On macOS, a different Mach-O binary malware is used. Researchers including cybersecurity group Koi and Ethereum editor Zak Cole identified the attack. Although some extensions were removed, attackers quickly replaced them with new versions, highlighting the persistence of the threat. The popularity of these repositories among developers working in both proprietary and open-source environments makes them attractive vectors for malware distribution. The open-source nature and large user bases of platforms like Visual Studio Marketplace\u2014which hosts over 48,000 extensions\u2014and Open VSX Registry\u2014with 3,000 extensions and over two million monthly downloads\u2014exacerbate the threat.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1757946540.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSCodium","title":"VSCodium","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code","title":"Visual Studio Code","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_Code","title":"Cascadia Code","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pt.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code","title":"Visual Studio Code","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pt.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"es.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code","title":"Visual Studio Code","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"es.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ru.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code","title":"Visual Studio Code","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"ru.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-plans-major-update-visual-studio-coding-service-ai-2025-7","title":"Internal Microsoft memo details plans for major update to its flagship coding service, as AI-powered rivals gain ground","snippet":"An internal Microsoft memo obtained by Business Insider reveals the company's plans for a significant update to its flagship software development environment, Visual Studio, in response to increasing competition from AI-driven coding tools. The upcoming version, referred to as \"Visual Studio 18\" by Jay Parikh, head of Microsoft's CoreAI group, is expected to be a major release filled with AI features. This move comes as Microsoft faces growing challenges from new offerings like Amazon\u2019s recently launched AI-powered IDE, Kiro, and the rise of competitors like Cursor, which has taken market share from Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot.\n\nWhile no official timeline was provided, Microsoft has already begun early internal testing (\"dogfooding\") of the new Visual Studio. The previous major release was in 2021, and Microsoft has continued to update the current version, Visual Studio 17, with features such as support for Anthropic\u2019s AI models and updates to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). A blog post hinted that more details would be shared later in the summer, emphasizing Microsoft's commitment to staying competitive in the AI-enhanced developer tools space.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1753347601.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_691655d94fe48328aba7452f9c11ca4e","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"7b245f8e-dcd3-4337-b481-c8f853381473","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"b00e1b9a-b24e-4ea2-9fca-0a32cd1af2f7","turn_exchange_id":"661384ba-aaf2-4034-9b12-0398b057f282","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b00e1b9a-b24e-4ea2-9fca-0a32cd1af2f7","children":["c9eb18eb-ca2a-402e-9d95-87e707eba0e4"]},"c9eb18eb-ca2a-402e-9d95-87e707eba0e4":{"id":"c9eb18eb-ca2a-402e-9d95-87e707eba0e4","message":{"id":"c9eb18eb-ca2a-402e-9d95-87e707eba0e4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1763071450.803878,"update_time":1763071453.019063,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If you want to download \ue200entity\ue202[\"software\", \"Visual Studio Code\", 0]\ue201 (VS Code), here are the steps:\n\n1.
