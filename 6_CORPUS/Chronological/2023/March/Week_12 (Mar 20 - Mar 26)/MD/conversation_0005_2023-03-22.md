Since my knowledge only extends until September 2021, I cannot provide specific information about the residential solar market trends since the beginning of the year in 2023. However, I can share some general trends and drivers that were shaping the solar market up until my knowledge cutoff date.

Up to September 2021, the residential solar market had been experiencing strong growth due to a combination of factors, including:

1. Decreasing costs: The costs of solar panels, inverters, and other necessary components had been steadily decreasing over time. This made solar power more affordable for homeowners and incentivized investments in residential solar installations.

2. Government incentives: Many countries, including the United States, had introduced tax credits, rebates, and other financial incentives to promote the adoption of solar power. These incentives helped to lower the upfront costs for homeowners and facilitated the growth of the residential solar market.

3. Environmental awareness: Growing awareness of climate change and environmental issues led more homeowners to consider solar power as a cleaner, more sustainable source of electricity.

4. Technological advancements: Improvements in solar panel efficiency and energy storage systems allowed homeowners to generate more power from their installations and store excess energy for use during peak demand or periods of low solar generation.

5. Grid modernization and net metering: Some countries and regions had implemented net metering policies that allowed homeowners to sell excess solar-generated electricity back to the grid. This created additional financial incentives for residential solar installations.

6. Growing interest in energy independence: The desire for energy independence and resilience against power outages led some homeowners to invest in residential solar systems, often combined with energy storage solutions.

While these trends were observed up to September 2021, it's important to keep in mind that they may have evolved since then. To get the most up-to-date information about the residential solar market, I recommend consulting recent industry reports or news articles.
