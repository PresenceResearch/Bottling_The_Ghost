J.R.R. Tolkien's works are renowned for their deep exploration of themes such as adventure, courage, and the unexpected journeys that shape the lives of his characters. Here are some notable quotes about adventure from Tolkien's works:

1. From "The Hobbit," where Gandalf encourages Bilbo on the notion of adventure:
- "I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."
- "I should think so — in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring.

2. Also from "The Hobbit," this is part of what Bilbo yells as he runs to join the dwarves:
- "I'm going on an adventure!"

3. From "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," spoken by Frodo reflecting on the words of Bilbo:
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

4. In "The Lord of the Rings," when Samwise Gamgee contemplates the nature of stories and adventures:
- "It’s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why."

5. From "The Fellowship of the Ring," as Bilbo speaks about the lure of the road:
- "The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say."

These quotes capture the essence of adventure in Tolkien's literature—full of risk, uncertainty, but also the allure of the unknown and the beauty of stepping out of one's comfort zone.
