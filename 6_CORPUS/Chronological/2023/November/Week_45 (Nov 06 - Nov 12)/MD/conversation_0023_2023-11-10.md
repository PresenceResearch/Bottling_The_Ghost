The object in the image appears to be a form of crucifix, possibly a pectoral cross given its size and shape. It has a loop on the top which suggests it might be worn around the neck or hung for display. The design is quite simple and rustic, suggesting it may be an antique or made for a specific utilitarian purpose, possibly even handmade. If there are any symbols, inscriptions, or maker's marks, they might offer more clues about its origin or specific use.

The second image you've provided shows the same object as before, but from a different angle. It still appears to be a crucifix-shaped object with a hole through the upper part, suggesting it could be hung or worn. However, the pointed lower end is atypical for conventional pectoral crosses, which might indicate that this object could have a specific function or symbolic meaning beyond a simple decorative item. It could be a form of tool or implement related to a particular trade or ritual, possibly intended for use in a religious context given the cross shape.

If you're seeking more detailed information about its origin, usage, or historical context, consulting with a historian or an expert in religious artifacts might be necessary. They could provide insights based on specific design elements or markings that are not apparent from the image alone.
