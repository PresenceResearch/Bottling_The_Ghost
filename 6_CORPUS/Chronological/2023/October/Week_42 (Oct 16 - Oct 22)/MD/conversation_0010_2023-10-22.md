elaborate on "all advice is autobiographical"

The phrase "all advice is autobiographical" suggests that the guidance or counsel someone gives to others is often a reflection of their own experiences, beliefs, values, and perspectives. In other words, when people offer advice, they are drawing upon their own life lessons, successes, failures, and the principles that have shaped their worldview.

Here's a breakdown of the idea:

1. **Personal Perspective:** People tend to see the world through the lens of their own experiences. When they provide advice, it's influenced by what has worked or not worked for them in the past.

2. **Individual Values and Beliefs:** Advice is not given in a vacuum; it's deeply tied to an individual's values and beliefs. What one person considers essential or valuable might not be the same for another.

3. **Lessons Learned:** Often, advice stems from personal lessons learned. It could be the result of overcoming challenges, facing adversity, or achieving personal goals. People are inclined to share the wisdom they've gained through their own journeys.

4. **Cultural and Social Context:** Advice is also shaped by cultural and social factors. The norms and values prevalent in a person's environment contribute to the advice they give. What is considered wise or prudent can vary across cultures and communities.

5. **Subjectivity of Experience:** Since everyone's life journey is unique, advice is inherently subjective. What works for one person may not work for another due to differences in circumstances, personality, or objectives.

6. **Implicit Biases:** Unconscious biases and perspectives that individuals hold can influence the advice they provide. These biases are often rooted in personal experiences and upbringing.

7. **Empathy and Understanding:** When offering advice, individuals may draw upon times when they faced similar situations. Empathy plays a role, and the advice given is a reflection of how the person navigated or wishes they had navigated similar circumstances.

8. **Continuous Evolution:** As individuals grow and evolve, so does their advice. What may have been considered sound guidance at one point in their lives might change as they gain new insights and experiences.

Understanding that advice is autobiographical doesn't necessarily diminish its value. It simply underscores the idea that advice should be considered in context, recognizing that it's coming from someone with a unique set of experiences and perspectives. It encourages those receiving advice to filter it through their own understanding and judgment, considering how it aligns with their own values and circumstances.
