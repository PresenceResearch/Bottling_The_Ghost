Chimichurri is a vibrant and tangy sauce or condiment that originates from Argentina and Uruguay. It is typically used to accompany grilled meats, particularly beef, and is a staple in Argentine and Uruguayan cuisine. The sauce is made from a mixture of finely chopped parsley, garlic, oregano, olive oil, vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Some variations also include ingredients like cilantro, lemon juice, or red wine vinegar. Chimichurri is known for its fresh and herby flavor profile, making it a popular choice for marinating or dressing grilled meats, vegetables, and even bread.
