A haiku is a traditional Japanese form of poetry that consists of three lines. The structure is simple, but it requires careful attention to syllables and imagery:

1. **Structure**: The haiku has a 5-7-5 syllable pattern:
   - **First line**: 5 syllables
   - **Second line**: 7 syllables
   - **Third line**: 5 syllables

2. **Theme**: Haikus often focus on nature, seasons, or a moment in time. They capture a feeling or image, evoking a deep or sometimes fleeting emotion.

3. **Kigo (Seasonal Word)**: Traditional haikus include a word or phrase that indicates the season, though modern haikus might not always follow this rule.

4. **Kireji (Cutting Word)**: A cutting word, used in Japanese haikus, is a kind of punctuation that gives the poem a moment of pause or a twist. In English, you might achieve this through punctuation or a change in tone.

**Example**:
  
   *Silent autumn night*  
   *Moonlight on the empty field*  
   *Crickets sing their song*  

This haiku follows the 5-7-5 pattern, evokes a sense of nature, and contains a peaceful, reflective mood.
