This is a Japanese 5 yen coin. The 5 yen coin is known for its distinct design, which features a hole in the middle. The design typically includes rice stalks, water, and a gear, symbolizing agriculture, fisheries, and industry, respectively. The coin's value is written in kanji characters (五円, pronounced "go-en"). Interestingly, the 5 yen coin is often considered lucky in Japan because the pronunciation of "go-en" can also mean "good fortune" or "good connection."

This coin is commonly used in Japan and is often offered at shrines as a symbolic donation for good luck.
