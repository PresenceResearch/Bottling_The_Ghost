How on you say what is that 

---

**Assistant:**

To say "What is that?" in Japanese, you would say:

**それは何ですか (それはなんですか, Sore wa nan desu ka)?** 

- **それ (sore)** means "that" (referring to something near the listener or previously mentioned).
- **は (wa)** is the topic marker.
- **何ですか (なんですか, nan desu ka)** means "What is it?" 

So the full sentence translates to "What is that?" in English.

I would like to

**Assistant:**

To say "I would like to" in Japanese, you can use the phrase:

**～たいです (～tai desu)**

This phrase is added to the stem of a verb to express your desire to do something. Here’s how it works:

1. Take the verb in its dictionary form (e.g., **食べる** - taberu, "to eat").
2. Remove the **-ru** ending from the verb to get the stem (e.g., **食べ** - tabe).
3. Add **たいです (tai desu)** to the stem to express "I would like to" (e.g., **食べたいです** - tabetai desu, "I would like to eat").

Here are some examples:

- **行きたいです (いきたいです, ikitai desu)** - I would like to go.
- **見たいです (みたいです, mitai desu)** - I would like to see.
- **買いたいです (かいたいです, kaitai desu)** - I would like to buy.

If you have a specific phrase in mind that you want to say "I would like to" for, I can help you translate that as well!

What about ordering 

---

**Assistant:**

When ordering something in Japanese, you can use the phrase:

**～をください (～o kudasai)**

This is the most common and polite way to request something, similar to saying "Please give me..." in English. Here’s how to use it:

1. Place the item or action you want before **を (o)**.
2. Add **ください (kudasai)** after it.

Examples:

- **水をください (みずをください, Mizu o kudasai)** - Please give me water.
- **メニューをください (メニューをください, Menyū o kudasai)** - Please give me the menu.
- **コーヒーをください (コーヒーをください, Kōhī o kudasai)** - Please give me coffee.

For ordering at a restaurant, you might also hear:

- **これをお願いします (これをおねがいします, Kore o onegai shimasu)** - I'll have this, please.
- **～を一つください (～をひとつください, ～o hitotsu kudasai)** - One of [item], please.

This is a very polite and standard way to order in most situations.

**Assistant:**

To say "It doesn't matter" in Japanese, you can use the phrase:

**問題ありません (もんだいありません, Mondai arimasen)**

This literally means "There is no problem," and it can be used to express that something is not an issue or that it doesn't matter.

Another common way to say "It doesn't matter" or "It's okay" is:

**大丈夫です (だいじょうぶです, Daijōbu desu)**

This phrase is very versatile and can be used in various contexts to indicate that something is okay or that it doesn't matter.

For a more casual or dismissive tone, you might say:

**気にしないでください (きにしないでください, Ki ni shinaide kudasai)** - "Please don't worry about it" or "Don't mind it."
