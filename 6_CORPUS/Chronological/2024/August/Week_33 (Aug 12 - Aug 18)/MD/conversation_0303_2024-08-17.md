4. **ダサい (Dasai)** - This means "uncool" or "tacky." It's often used to describe something or someone that's out of style.

6. **マジで (Maji de)** - This means "seriously" or "really." It's often used to emphasize something surprising or unbelievable.

Do they say “Gucci” in Japanese like we say in America 

---

**Assistant:**

In Japan, the term "Gucci" is not commonly used as slang like it is in America to mean "cool" or "good." Instead, "Gucci" is primarily associated with the luxury fashion brand. Japanese slang tends to have its own unique expressions, so while people in Japan might be aware of the American slang, they wouldn't typically use "Gucci" in the same way. 

If you want to say something is cool or good in Japanese slang, you might use terms like **かっこいい (Kakkoii)** for "cool" or **いいね (Ii ne)** for "that's good" or "nice."

In Japanese, there are several slang terms used to express being annoyed or pissed off:

1. **ムカつく (Mukatsuku)** - This is a common term used to express feeling annoyed, irritated, or pissed off. It's a strong expression, so it conveys a significant level of frustration.

2. **ウザい (Uzai)** - This word is used to describe something or someone that is really annoying or irritating. It’s a bit more casual than "mukatsuku" but still conveys annoyance.

3. **イラつく (Iratsuku)** - This is another term that means to be irritated or annoyed. It's similar to "mukatsuku" but can be used in a slightly broader range of situations.

These terms are often used in casual conversations among friends or when venting frustration.
