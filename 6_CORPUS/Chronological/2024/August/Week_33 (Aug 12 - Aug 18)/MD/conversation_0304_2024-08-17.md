To cast a MacBook to a projector, follow these steps:

### **1. Connect via HDMI or VGA:**
   - **HDMI:** Most modern projectors support HDMI. Use an HDMI cable to connect your MacBook to the projector. If your MacBook has USB-C ports, you'll need a USB-C to HDMI adapter.
   - **VGA:** For older projectors, you might need a VGA cable. Use a USB-C to VGA adapter if necessary.

### **2. Connect Wirelessly via AirPlay:**
   - If the projector supports AirPlay, you can wirelessly connect your MacBook.
   - Click on the **Control Center** icon in the top-right corner of your Mac's menu bar.
   - Select **Screen Mirroring** and choose your projector from the list.

### **3. Configure Display Settings:**
   - Once connected, go to **System Settings** > **Displays** on your Mac.
   - You can choose to **Mirror Displays** (show the same content on both screens) or **Use As Separate Display** (extend your desktop across both screens).

### **4. Adjust Resolution (if necessary):**
   - You might need to adjust the resolution to match the projector. In the **Displays** settings, you can change the resolution to suit your needs.

### **5. Audio Settings:**
   - If you want the audio to play through the projector's speakers, go to **System Settings** > **Sound** and select the projector as the output device.

Once these steps are completed, your MacBook should be successfully casting to the projector.
