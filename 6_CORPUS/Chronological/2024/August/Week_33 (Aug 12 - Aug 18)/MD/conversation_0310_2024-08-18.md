The sword in the images you provided appears to be a type of military officer's sword, likely from Japan, given the context of your current location and the design elements visible.

Here are some observations:

1. **Hilt Design**: The hilt features intricate metalwork with floral motifs, including a prominent flower, possibly a chrysanthemum, which is a symbol often associated with the Japanese imperial family. The design suggests it may be an officer's sword, used in ceremonial or dress contexts.

2. **Guard**: The sword has a knuckle guard that wraps around the hand, a feature common in swords used by officers for added protection. The guard also has a detailed design, indicating that this sword was made with a significant level of craftsmanship.

3. **Grip**: The grip appears to be wrapped and has a ribbed design, likely for better handling. This type of grip is common in swords meant to be functional as well as decorative.

4. **Overall Condition**: The sword shows some signs of age, with oxidation visible on the blade. This suggests that it is an older piece, possibly an antique.

Given these details, it is likely that this sword is a Japanese officer's sword, possibly from the late 19th or early 20th century, such as a katana or a kyu gunto, which were commonly used during that period. The kyu gunto was introduced in the late Meiji period and was used through World War II by Japanese military officers.

If this is a family heirloom or has historical significance, it could be a valuable and important piece, especially if it dates back to the time when Japan was undergoing significant military modernization.

The value of a Japanese officer's sword can vary widely depending on several factors, including its historical significance, condition, craftsmanship, materials, and provenance. Here’s a general breakdown of what can influence the price:

1. **Historical Significance**: Swords that have been owned by notable individuals or were used in significant historical events tend to be more valuable.

2. **Condition**: Swords in excellent condition, with minimal rust, intact blades, and original fittings, are worth more than those in poor condition.

3. **Craftsmanship**: The quality of the swordsmith's work, including the blade's sharpness, the intricate details on the hilt and guard, and the materials used, all contribute to the sword's value. Hand-forged blades by famous swordsmiths can be particularly valuable.

4. **Provenance**: If the sword has documented history or has been in a well-known collection, it can increase its value significantly.

5. **Rarity**: Certain types of swords, especially those from specific periods or made by renowned swordsmiths, are rarer and thus more valuable.

### Estimated Value Range
- **Basic Officer Swords**: These can range from $500 to $2,000, depending largely on the condition and authenticity.
- **Higher-End or Rare Swords**: If the sword is particularly rare, in excellent condition, or has historical significance, the value can range from $2,000 to $10,000 or more.
- **Antique and Historical Swords**: Swords with significant historical value, especially those from well-known periods or made by famous swordsmiths, can be worth $10,000 to $50,000 or more.

### Next Steps
To get an accurate appraisal, it’s best to consult with a specialist in Japanese militaria or antique swords. An expert can provide a more precise valuation after examining the sword in person, particularly the blade, which carries much of the sword's value. 

If you’re considering selling the sword, having it appraised by multiple experts and obtaining documentation of its authenticity and history can help in getting the best price.

Knowing that the sword was worn by a Japanese officer in World War II does add significant historical context and can increase its value. Here’s how this specific history affects the sword’s worth:

### Impact on Value:
1. **Historical Context**: World War II artifacts, particularly those linked to Japanese military officers, are highly collectible. The sword’s association with this period, especially if it was used or carried by an officer during significant battles or campaigns, adds to its historical value.

2. **Provenance**: If you have documentation or any form of provenance that verifies the sword was indeed worn by a Japanese officer during World War II, it could increase the sword’s value. Collectors and historians often place a premium on items with well-documented histories.

3. **Rarity**: Swords from this period, particularly officer's swords, are relatively common, but well-preserved examples with clear historical connections to World War II can fetch higher prices.

### Estimated Value with Context:
- **Standard World War II Officer's Swords**: These can range from $1,500 to $3,000 depending on condition and any additional unique features.
- **With Provenance and Historical Significance**: If the sword has a documented history of being used by a specific officer or in a notable battle, the value could increase to between $3,000 and $10,000 or more.
- **High-End Collectible Swords**: If the sword is in excellent condition and has significant historical provenance, such as being associated with a high-ranking officer or a specific important event, the value could exceed $10,000.

### Recommendations:
1. **Appraisal**: For an accurate assessment, I recommend getting the sword appraised by a specialist in World War II memorabilia or Japanese militaria. They can provide a more precise valuation based on the sword's specific history and condition.

2. **Preservation**: To maintain its value, ensure that the sword is stored properly, avoiding conditions that could lead to further rust or deterioration.

3. **Provenance Documentation**: If possible, gather any documentation or stories related to the sword's history during World War II. This could include letters, photographs, or other records that confirm its use by a Japanese officer.

This additional context certainly enhances the sword's historical and collectible value.
