{"prompt":"A piece of 17th-century Japanese art, incorporating the essence of traditional calligraphy with flowing, elegant brush strokes. The text should be arranged in vertical columns, using characters that reflect the aesthetic and spiritual depth of Japanese calligraphy. The background should have a parchment-like texture, resembling aged paper with subtle hues of beige and light brown, and a faint red border. The characters should have an ink-wash effect, showing variations in intensity and brush pressure, typical of the Edo period art style." ,"size":"1024x1024"}

{"prompt":"A Japanese calligraphy piece in the style of the 17th century, featuring the text from the previous images superimposed over a prominent aminashigate brush stroke. The brush stroke should be bold and flowing, crossing the parchment-like background with elegant curves. The stroke should appear in dark black ink, contrasting with the textured beige background, and slightly obscuring some of the text underneath, creating a harmonious blend of traditional Japanese aesthetics and calligraphy." ,"size":"1024x1024"}
