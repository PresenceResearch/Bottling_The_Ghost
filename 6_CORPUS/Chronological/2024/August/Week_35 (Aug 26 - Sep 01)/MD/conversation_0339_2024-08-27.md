The plant in the image appears to be a banana plant (Musa species). It looks like it's struggling, and there are a few possible reasons for its condition:

1. **Watering Issues**: Banana plants need consistently moist soil, but not soggy. If the soil is too dry, the plant will start to wilt and the leaves will dry out, as seen here. On the other hand, overwatering can lead to root rot, which can also cause the plant to deteriorate.

2. **Light Conditions**: Banana plants require bright, indirect sunlight. If the plant is not getting enough light, it might struggle to grow and the leaves can start to die back.

3. **Humidity**: Banana plants thrive in high humidity. If the air in the room is too dry, the leaves can dry out, especially during the winter when indoor air tends to be drier.

4. **Temperature**: These plants prefer warm temperatures. Cold drafts or temperatures below 60°F (15°C) can cause the plant to suffer and eventually die.

### How to Fix It:

1. **Adjust Watering**: Check the soil moisture. Water the plant when the top inch of soil is dry, but avoid letting it sit in water. Ensure the pot has good drainage.

2. **Increase Humidity**: You can increase humidity around the plant by misting it regularly, placing it on a humidity tray, or using a humidifier in the room.

3. **Improve Light Exposure**: Make sure the plant is getting plenty of bright, indirect light. If it’s too close to a window with direct sunlight, the leaves might scorch. Consider moving it to a spot with bright, filtered light.

4. **Maintain Warmth**: Ensure the plant is kept in a warm room and away from cold drafts. Avoid placing it near windows or doors that might let in cold air.

5. **Prune Damaged Leaves**: Trim off the severely damaged leaves to encourage the plant to focus its energy on new growth. Use clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears.

After making these adjustments, the plant should gradually recover. However, if the root system is severely damaged, it may take some time for new growth to appear.
