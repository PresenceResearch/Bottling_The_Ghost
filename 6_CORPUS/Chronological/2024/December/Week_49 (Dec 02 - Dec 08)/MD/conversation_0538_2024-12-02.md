Top round is a lean cut of beef that benefits from slower cooking methods or marinades to enhance flavor and tenderness. Here’s how to cook your 2.26 lb top round depending on your desired method:

---

### **1. Roast (Oven)**  
Great for an even cook and minimal effort.

**Ingredients**:
- 2.26 lb top round
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced (optional)

**Steps**:
1. **Preheat oven** to 325°F (163°C).
2. Rub the beef with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings.
3. Sear the beef in a hot skillet (2–3 minutes per side) to create a crust.
4. Place the beef in a roasting pan with a rack or on a bed of vegetables.
5. Roast until the internal temperature is:
   - 120–125°F (49–52°C) for rare
   - 130–135°F (54–57°C) for medium-rare
   - 140–145°F (60–63°C) for medium
6. Remove, tent with foil, and let rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain.
