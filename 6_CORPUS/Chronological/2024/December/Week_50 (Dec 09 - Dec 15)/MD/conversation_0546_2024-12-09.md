I am proposing a 75 kW solar system.  Full project cost I am proposing is $199,868 or $2.66/Watt.  Gross margin is $76,613, panel cost is $39,750 and inverter cost is $12,750.  Racking is $13,500.  I have been asked to provide a labor  bid which will be excluding panels, inverters, and racking.  What should the price for that be that will allow me to recoup the margin I would earn from the markup on the panels, inverters and racking?

---

**Assistant:**

To calculate the labor bid that allows you to recoup your margin from the markup on the panels, inverters, and racking, follow these steps:

### 1. **Determine Total Equipment Costs**
   - **Panel Cost:** $39,750  
   - **Inverter Cost:** $12,750  
   - **Racking Cost:** $13,500  
   - **Total Equipment Cost (TEC):**  
     \[
     TEC = 39,750 + 12,750 + 13,500 = 66,000
     \]

### 2. **Determine the Equipment Markup**
   The full project cost is $199,868, and the equipment cost (TEC) is $66,000. Subtracting the TEC from the project cost leaves you with the balance attributed to labor, permitting, overhead, etc., which includes your gross margin.

   - **Gross Margin:** $76,613  
   - **Markup on Equipment (MOE):**
     \[
     MOE = 76,613 \times \frac{66,000}{199,868} = \text{approx. } 25,286
     \]

### 3. **Calculate Labor Bid**
   To preserve your margin, the labor bid must absorb the gross margin that would have been earned from marking up the panels, inverters, and racking.

   - **Labor Bid:**  
     \[
     Labor\ Bid = 199,868 - 66,000 + 25,286 = 159,154
     \]

Thus, the **labor bid** you should propose is approximately **$159,154**.

**You:**

what is that per watt

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-09 13:00:57*

To calculate the labor bid cost per watt, divide the total labor bid by the system size:

### 1. **Labor Bid**
The labor bid is **$159,154**.

### 2. **System Size**
The system size is **75 kW** or **75,000 watts**.

### 3. **Cost Per Watt**
\[
\text{Cost Per Watt} = \frac{\text{Labor Bid}}{\text{System Size}} = \frac{159,154}{75,000} \approx 2.12
\]

### Final Answer:
The **labor bid cost per watt** is approximately **$2.12/Watt**.

---

**You:**

*2024-12-09 13:01:20*

what would this number be if the panel cost was $.22/watt?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-09 13:01:42*

To adjust the calculations with a **panel cost of $0.22/Watt**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **New Panel Cost**
\[
\text{New Panel Cost} = \text{System Size (W)} \times \text{Panel Cost Per Watt}
\]
\[
\text{New Panel Cost} = 75,000 \times 0.22 = 16,500
\]

---

### 2. **Revised Total Equipment Cost (TEC)**
The costs for the inverters and racking remain unchanged:
- **Inverter Cost:** $12,750
- **Racking Cost:** $13,500

\[
\text{Revised TEC} = 16,500 + 12,750 + 13,500 = 42,750
\]

---

### 3. **Markup on Equipment (MOE)**
The gross margin is still $76,613. The equipment markup is recalculated based on the new TEC:

\[
\text{MOE} = 76,613 \times \frac{42,750}{199,868} \approx 16,379
\]

---

### 4. **Revised Labor Bid**
The labor bid, excluding panels, inverters, and racking, is adjusted as follows:

\[
\text{Labor Bid} = \text{Project Cost} - \text{Revised TEC} + \text{MOE}
\]
\[
\text{Labor Bid} = 199,868 - 42,750 + 16,379 = 173,497
\]

---

### 5. **Cost Per Watt**
\[
\text{Cost Per Watt} = \frac{\text{Labor Bid}}{\text{System Size (W)}} = \frac{173,497}{75,000} \approx 2.31
\]

---

### Final Answer:
With a panel cost of **$0.22/Watt**, the **labor cost per watt** is approximately **$2.31/Watt**.

**You:**

*2024-12-09 13:03:07*

Assume a cost of $71,903 for the labor only portion which includes $27,562 in gross margin.  what should this price be if I want to capture the margin lost by the exclusion of equipment?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-09 13:03:20*

To calculate the labor price while capturing the margin lost due to the exclusion of equipment, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Determine Lost Margin from Excluded Equipment**
From the earlier calculation:
- **Equipment Markup (MOE)**: $25,286 (lost margin from excluding equipment).

---

### 2. **Current Labor Cost and Margin**
- **Labor Cost**: $71,903
- **Current Gross Margin in Labor**: $27,562

---

### 3. **Revised Labor Price**
To capture the lost equipment margin, add the lost margin to the current labor price:

\[
\text{Revised Labor Price} = \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Lost Margin}
\]
\[
\text{Revised Labor Price} = 71,903 + 25,286 = 97,189
\]

---

### 4. **Calculate New Gross Margin**
- The new gross margin will include the original labor margin plus the recovered equipment margin:

\[
\text{New Gross Margin} = 27,562 + 25,286 = 52,848
\]

---

### 5. **Cost Per Watt**
The system size remains 75,000 watts:
\[
\text{Cost Per Watt} = \frac{\text{Revised Labor Price}}{\text{System Size}} = \frac{97,189}{75,000} \approx 1.30
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The **revised labor price** should be **$97,189**, which equates to approximately **$1.30/Watt**, to capture the lost margin from excluding equipment.

---

**You:**

*2024-12-09 13:05:54*

what about with the panel price at $.53/watt

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-09 13:06:11*

If the **panel price is $0.53/Watt**, here's how the calculation changes:

---

### 1. **New Panel Cost**
\[
\text{New Panel Cost} = \text{System Size (W)} \times \text{Panel Price Per Watt}
\]
\[
\text{New Panel Cost} = 75,000 \times 0.53 = 39,750
\]

---

### 2. **Revised Total Equipment Cost (TEC)**
The costs for inverters and racking remain unchanged:
- **Inverter Cost:** $12,750
- **Racking Cost:** $13,500

\[
\text{Revised TEC} = 39,750 + 12,750 + 13,500 = 66,000
\]

---

### 3. **Markup on Equipment (MOE)**
With the updated TEC of $66,000, the lost margin on the equipment is:

\[
\text{MOE} = 76,613 \times \frac{66,000}{199,868} \approx 25,286
\]

---

### 4. **Labor Cost and Current Margin**
- **Labor Cost:** $71,903
- **Current Labor Gross Margin:** $27,562

---

### 5. **Revised Labor Price**
Add the lost margin from the equipment exclusion to the current labor price:

\[
\text{Revised Labor Price} = \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Lost Margin}
\]
\[
\text{Revised Labor Price} = 71,903 + 25,286 = 97,189
\]

---

### 6. **Cost Per Watt**
The system size is 75,000 watts:
\[
\text{Cost Per Watt} = \frac{\text{Revised Labor Price}}{\text{System Size}} = \frac{97,189}{75,000} \approx 1.30
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The **labor price remains $97,189**, which is approximately **$1.30/Watt**, even with the panel price of $0.53/Watt**, because the equipment cost and markup haven’t changed.

---

**You:**

*2024-12-09 13:06:54*

what would the $/watt be if i wanted total gross margin to be $76,000

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-09 13:07:11*

To calculate the cost per watt for the labor bid if you want the **total gross margin to be $76,000**, here’s how you can adjust the labor price:

---

### 1. **Determine Target Labor Gross Margin**
The desired total gross margin is $76,000. Subtract the lost gross margin from equipment exclusion to find the labor margin required:

\[
\text{Labor Gross Margin} = \text{Total Desired Gross Margin} - \text{Lost Equipment Margin}
\]
From earlier, the **lost equipment margin (MOE)** is **$25,286**.

\[
\text{Labor Gross Margin} = 76,000 - 25,286 = 50,714
\]

---

### 2. **Calculate Total Labor Price**
The labor price needs to include the labor costs plus the new gross margin:

\[
\text{Labor Price} = \text{Labor Costs} + \text{Labor Gross Margin}
\]
\[
\text{Labor Price} = 71,903 + 50,714 = 122,617
\]

---

### 3. **Calculate Cost Per Watt**
Divide the total labor price by the system size (75,000 watts):

\[
\text{Cost Per Watt} = \frac{\text{Labor Price}}{\text{System Size}}
\]
\[
\text{Cost Per Watt} = \frac{122,617}{75,000} \approx 1.63
\]

---

### Final Answer:
To achieve a **total gross margin of $76,000**, the **labor price would be $122,617**, resulting in a **cost per watt of $1.63/Watt**.
