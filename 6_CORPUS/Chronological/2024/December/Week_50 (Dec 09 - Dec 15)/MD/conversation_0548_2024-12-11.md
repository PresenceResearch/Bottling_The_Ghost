The Diesel **Larkee** jeans have a **regular straight fit**, which means they offer a classic fit that's comfortable and not too tight or too loose. If you're looking for Diesel jeans with a similar but slightly tapered fit, the **Larkee-Beex** might also be a good choice. Let me know if you want specifics on other Diesel fits!

The Diesel **Keever** jeans are a **slim-tapered fit**. They sit closer to the body through the thighs and gradually narrow from the knee to the ankle, giving a modern, streamlined look. They're great if you want something fitted but not as tight as a skinny jean. Let me know if you'd like more details or style tips!
