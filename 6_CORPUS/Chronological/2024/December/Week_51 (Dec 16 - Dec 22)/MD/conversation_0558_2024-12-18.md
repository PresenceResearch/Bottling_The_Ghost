i have designed this solar system in Aurora.  It is 269.8 kW and consists of 664 Trina 405 watt panels.  I have attached a picture of the meter it will be connected to and the utility bill of the account it will be attached to.  What can you tell me about the buildings electrical service by looking at the bill and the meter?  Based on the attached can you draw a rudimentery one-line drawing?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-18 12:26:06*

### **What I can tell about the building’s electrical service:**

1. **Meter Configuration:**
   - The meter in the image is a **GE KV2c**, a commercial-grade smart meter that supports **multi-voltage ranges** from **120V-480V** and can handle high demands (common for buildings with three-phase power systems).
   - The multiplier on the meter reads **160**, meaning the recorded energy usage is multiplied by this factor to calculate actual consumption. This multiplier indicates the presence of **current transformers (CTs)**, typical for large commercial buildings.

2. **Utility Bill Details**:
   - The building is billed on the **Non-Residential-MGT-LV II** rate structure, meaning it operates on **Low Voltage service** but with significant energy and demand charges.
   - **Monthly Demand**:
     - **On-Peak Demand**: 41.6 kW
     - **Int-Peak Demand**: 39.36 kW
     - **Off-Peak Demand**: 42.56 kW
   - **Energy Consumption**:
     - Total kWh for the billing period is **53,464 kWh**.
     - This aligns with the heavy usage typical of commercial buildings.

3. **Load Profile:**
   - A **peak demand of 105.85 kW** is noted, suggesting the building has substantial HVAC systems, lighting, or machinery.
   - The consistent **on-peak demand** reflects sustained load patterns, which may allow solar generation to offset daytime consumption effectively.

### **Rudimentary One-Line Diagram**:

Here is a basic layout of how the system would connect:

```plaintext
                             Utility Grid
                                 │
                         [Main Service Panel]
                                 │
           ----------------------------------------
          │                                        │
       [Meter]                                 [Solar Inverter(s)]
          │                                        │
          └----------------------[269.8 kW PV System] (664 Panels)
```

1. **Utility Grid** → The main service panel connects to the grid via the existing Pepco infrastructure.
2. **Main Service Panel** → This handles the building’s entire load and integrates the solar production.
3. **Meter** → Measures net energy flow (import/export) between the building and the utility grid.
4. **Solar Inverters** → Convert DC electricity from the **664 Trina 405W panels** to AC power.
5. **PV System** → Designed for 269.8 kW DC capacity.

---

### **Additional Notes**:
- The **GE KV2c meter** supports net metering configurations, which aligns with the solar system interconnection.
- Your PV system can likely reduce energy charges and partially offset demand during sunlight hours. Demand charges, however, may need additional strategies (e.g., energy storage) to reduce peak loads.

- When entering coordinates (e.g., latitude/longitude), the CRS must match the coordinate system used:
   1. Ensure the **CRS of the layer** is set to **EPSG:4326** for geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude).
   2. For UTM or other projected systems, set the corresponding CRS (e.g., **EPSG:32633** for UTM Zone 33N).

### **Common CRS Codes**
- **EPSG:4326** (WGS 84): Global lat/lon (used for GPS).
- **EPSG:3857** (Pseudo-Mercator): Web mapping (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).
- **EPSG:326xx** (UTM Zones): For local projections in meters.
