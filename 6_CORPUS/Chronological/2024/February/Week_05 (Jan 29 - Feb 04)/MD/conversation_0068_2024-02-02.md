how does PECO determine PEak usage hours

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:28:04*

PECO determines peak usage hours as part of their Time-of-Use Pricing program. Generally, "peak" rates are in effect during hours when energy demand is highest, typically on weekdays. Specifically, for PECO, peak rates apply from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. This is the period when electricity is typically most expensive due to higher demand. To take advantage of lower rates, it's beneficial to shift your energy usage to off-peak hours, which for PECO include all other hours outside of the 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. window on weekdays, with "super off-peak" rates applying from midnight until 6 a.m. every day【8†source】【8†source】.

how does rooftop solar lower peak demand?  Is there a standard multiplier that is used?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:29:11*

Rooftop solar can significantly lower peak demand charges in the following ways:

1. **Direct Reduction in Demand**: Solar panels generate electricity during the day, often aligning with peak demand hours (especially in the afternoon when the sun is at its highest). This can directly reduce the amount of electricity you need to draw from the grid during these expensive times.

2. **Net Metering**: Some utilities offer net metering, where excess electricity generated by your solar panels is sent back to the grid, effectively reducing your net energy consumption. This can also offset demand during peak hours if your system produces more power than you use at that time.

3. **Use of Solar Batteries**: If paired with a storage system (solar batteries), solar panels can provide even more benefits. You can store the energy produced during the day (when demand and production are high) and use it during peak hours or at night, further reducing your demand from the grid.

Regarding a standard multiplier, there isn't a universally applicable one because the impact of rooftop solar on peak demand charges depends on several factors:

- **Size and orientation of the solar system**: Larger systems that are well-oriented (e.g., facing south in the Northern Hemisphere) will produce more electricity.
- **Geographical location**: Areas with more sunlight will naturally yield more solar power.
- **Time-of-Use rates**: The structure of electricity rates and how they coincide with solar production times can affect savings.
- **Local policies**: Incentives, net metering policies, and other local regulations can impact the financial return of installing solar panels.

To get a precise calculation of how rooftop solar would affect your peak demand charges, it would be best to consult with a solar provider or an energy specialist who can analyze your specific situation, including your energy usage pattern, the local rate structure, and the potential solar system's size and orientation. They can provide a more tailored analysis and possibly even a simulation of your expected savings.

Can PECO provide 15 minute inverval usage information?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:30:03*

Yes, PECO can provide 15-minute interval usage information to customers. This level of detailed data is typically available through advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), commonly known as smart meters. Smart meters record electricity consumption in short intervals, such as every 15 minutes, and transmit this data back to the utility.

Customers with smart meters installed can often access their interval data through:

1. **Online Customer Portals**: Utilities like PECO usually offer online portals where customers can log in to view their usage data, track their energy consumption patterns, and sometimes get recommendations for energy savings.

2. **Energy Management Systems**: Businesses and individuals with more complex energy management needs might use specialized software or services that can take this 15-minute interval data and provide more comprehensive analytics or automation to optimize energy usage.

3. **Direct Requests**: If the information isn't readily available through an online portal, customers can contact the utility directly to request their usage data.

This granular data is particularly useful for identifying peak usage times and evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce peak demand charges. If you're a PECO customer interested in this data, it's advisable to check their specific offerings or contact them directly for how you can access your 15-minute interval usage information.

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:31:10*

please analyze peak demand on this bill

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:31:30*

The bill indicates a peak demand (Pk kW) of 427.20 kW with a total consumption of 173,098 kWh for the service period from 09/01/2023 to 10/03/2023. The peak demand charge is a significant part of the bill, calculated by multiplying the peak kW by the rate (427 kW X $5.49000). To reduce these charges, consider implementing energy-saving measures during peak hours, using energy-efficient appliances, and possibly investing in energy management systems or solar solutions to offset peak demand.

how will rooftop solar effect the peak demand charges.  Please be specific and create data for a site in Horsham, PA

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:32:13*

In Horsham, PA, rooftop solar can significantly affect peak demand charges by generating electricity during the high-demand (and high-cost) afternoon hours. With Horsham's decent sunlight exposure, a properly sized and oriented system might reduce peak demand by a substantial percentage. For example, a system producing 300 kW during peak hours could reduce the peak demand from 427.20 kW to 127.20 kW, significantly lowering the demand charges, considering PECO's rate of $5.49000 per kW for peak demand. Actual savings depend on specific conditions like system size, orientation, and weather patterns.

recalculate the entire bill assuming a rooftop solar array

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:33:30*

To recalculate the entire bill assuming a rooftop solar array that reduces the peak demand from 427.20 kW to 127.20 kW, we'll make a few assumptions:

1. **Peak Demand Charges**:
   - Original: 427.20 kW * $5.49000/kW = $2,345.08
   - With Solar: 127.20 kW * $5.49000/kW = $698.52
   - Reduction: $2,345.08 - $698.52 = $1,646.56

2. **Energy Charges**:
   - Assuming the solar array generates enough to cover a portion of the consumption, let's say it covers 30% of the 173,098 kWh.
   - Solar Production: 173,098 kWh * 30% = 51,929.4 kWh
   - Remaining Consumption: 173,098 kWh - 51,929.4 kWh = 121,168.6 kWh
   - If the energy rate is $0.10/kWh (hypothetical rate for calculation):
      - Original: 173,098 kWh * $0.10/kWh = $17,309.80
      - With Solar: 121,168.6 kWh * $0.10/kWh = $12,116.86
      - Reduction: $17,309.80 - $12,116.86 = $5,192.94

3. **Total Bill**:
   - Original Total: $2,345.08 (Peak) + $17,309.80 (Energy) = $19,654.88
   - With Solar Total: $698.52 (Peak) + $12,116.86 (Energy) = $12,815.38
   - Total Reduction: $19,654.88 - $12,815.38 = $6,839.50

These calculations are approximations and the actual figures will depend on specific rates, the performance of the solar system, and the consumption pattern of the facility. It's also worth noting that there might be other charges or credits on the bill that could be affected by installing a solar system, such as distribution charges or solar incentives. For a precise calculation, it's recommended to consult with a solar provider or energy consultant.

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:33:59*

assume solar offsets all monthly usage and is net metered

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:34:17*

Assuming the solar offsets all monthly usage and is net metered, your energy charges would effectively be zero as the solar production would cover all consumption. The peak demand charge would still apply, but only for the demand not met by solar during peak times. If the solar array completely covers peak demand:

1. **Peak Demand Charges**: Reduced to zero if solar covers the entire 427.20 kW during peak times.
2. **Energy Charges**: Zero, since all usage is offset by solar production.
3. **Total Bill**: Essentially reduced to any fixed charges, taxes, or fees that are part of the bill aside from energy and demand charges.

A solar installation of this capacity would significantly reduce the energy bill, primarily leaving only the unavoidable fixed charges.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:35:33*

in your 30% example assume energy rate is $.063

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:35:49*

Let's recalculate the energy charges with the new rate of $0.063 per kWh, assuming the solar array offsets 30% of the consumption:

1. **Energy Charges**:
   - Solar Production: 173,098 kWh * 30% = 51,929.4 kWh
   - Remaining Consumption: 173,098 kWh - 51,929.4 kWh = 121,168.6 kWh
   - New Energy Rate: $0.063/kWh
   - Energy Charges with Solar: 121,168.6 kWh * $0.063/kWh = $7,633.62

2. **Total Bill with Solar**:
   - Assuming the peak demand charge is the same as in the previous example ($698.52):
   - Total with Solar: $698.52 (Peak) + $7,633.62 (Energy) = $8,332.14
   - This reflects the new total bill with the adjusted energy rate and the impact of the solar production.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:36:51*

assume peak period is 2 to 6pm.  Does this change solar's effect on peak charges?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:37:02*

Yes, the peak period being from 2 to 6 pm does influence solar's effect on peak charges. Solar panels produce the most electricity when the sun is at its highest, which typically coincides with this period. If your solar production peaks during these hours, it's more likely to offset your peak demand, reducing the demand charges even further. This alignment means solar can be very effective in reducing peak charges, especially on sunny days.

Please create a table comparing the current bill with the 30% hypothetical example

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:37:49*

| Charge Type       | Current Bill | With 30% Solar Offset & Rate at $0.063 |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Peak Demand (kW)  | 427.20 kW    | 127.20 kW (assuming solar covers peak) |
| Peak Charge Rate  | $5.49000/kW  | $5.49000/kW                            |
| Peak Demand Cost  | $2,345.08    | $698.52                                |
| Energy Usage (kWh)| 173,098 kWh  | 121,168.6 kWh (70% of original usage)  |
| Energy Rate       | Not provided | $0.063/kWh                             |
| Energy Cost       | Not provided | $7,633.62                              |
| Total Bill        | Not provided | $8,332.14 (Peak + Energy)              |

This table compares the current bill with a hypothetical scenario where a solar array offsets 30% of the energy usage and reduces the peak demand significantly. The total bill with solar is based on the new peak demand cost and the energy cost calculated with the reduced consumption at the rate of $0.063/kWh.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:38:29*

please assume same energy cost for curent and for solar

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:38:49*

Here's a revised table assuming the same energy cost rate for both the current bill and the hypothetical solar scenario:

| Charge Type       | Current Bill ($0.063/kWh) | With 30% Solar Offset ($0.063/kWh) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Peak Demand (kW)  | 427.20 kW                 | 127.20 kW                          |
| Peak Charge Rate  | $5.49000/kW               | $5.49000/kW                        |
| Peak Demand Cost  | $2,345.08                 | $698.52                            |
| Energy Usage (kWh)| 173,098 kWh               | 121,168.6 kWh (70% of original)    |
| Energy Rate       | $0.063/kWh                | $0.063/kWh                         |
| Energy Cost       | $10,905.18                | $7,633.62                          |
| Total Bill        | $13,250.26                | $8,332.14 (Peak + Energy)          |

This table illustrates the impact of a 30% solar offset on both peak demand and energy costs, showing a substantial reduction in the total bill.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:39:10*

please assume peak hours of 2 to 6pm

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:39:35*

Assuming peak hours are from 2 to 6 pm, and if the solar production aligns well with this period, it can significantly reduce the peak demand charges. However, the total energy offset by the solar system remains the same (30%). Here's the revised bill estimate:

| Charge Type       | Current Bill ($0.063/kWh) | With 30% Solar Offset ($0.063/kWh) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Peak Demand (kW)  | 427.20 kW                 | Likely reduced significantly due to alignment with solar production hours |
| Peak Charge Rate  | $5.49000/kW               | $5.49000/kW                        |
| Peak Demand Cost  | $2,345.08                 | Reduced, exact value depends on actual solar production during peak hours |
| Energy Usage (kWh)| 173,098 kWh               | 121,168.6 kWh (70% of original)    |
| Energy Rate       | $0.063/kWh                | $0.063/kWh                         |
| Energy Cost       | $10,905.18                | $7,633.62                          |
| Total Bill        | $13,250.26                | Lower, specific value depends on peak demand reduction |

The exact reduction in peak demand charges would depend on the actual performance of the solar system during the peak hours of 2 to 6 pm. The energy cost savings remain as calculated with a 30% offset by solar.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:39:59*

assume solar efficiency factor of 1.25 and assume this bill is for September

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:40:08*

With a solar efficiency factor of 1.25 and considering September's solar generation potential, the solar system might produce more energy during peak hours, further reducing the peak demand charges. This efficiency factor means the system operates at 125% of its nominal capacity during optimal conditions, which are likely in September due to longer daylight hours and generally clear skies. This would further decrease the peak kW during 2 to 6 pm, leading to a lower total bill, especially in the peak demand cost section. Exact savings would depend on actual solar production and consumption patterns.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:40:20*

please demonstrate in table

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:40:37*

Given the solar efficiency factor of 1.25 and the bill being for September, here's how the bill might look:

| Charge Type       | Current Bill ($0.063/kWh) | With 30% Solar Offset & Efficiency 1.25 ($0.063/kWh) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Peak Demand (kW)  | 427.20 kW                 | Reduced further due to increased solar efficiency    |
| Peak Charge Rate  | $5.49000/kW               | $5.49000/kW                                          |
| Peak Demand Cost  | $2,345.08                 | Further reduced from $698.52                          |
| Energy Usage (kWh)| 173,098 kWh               | 121,168.6 kWh (70% of original)                      |
| Energy Rate       | $0.063/kWh                | $0.063/kWh                                           |
| Energy Cost       | $10,905.18                | $7,633.62                                            |
| Total Bill        | $13,250.26                | Lower due to efficiency and peak alignment           |

The efficiency factor and solar generation during peak hours in September would likely reduce the peak demand costs more than the initial calculation, but the exact figures depend on the system's actual output and consumption patterns.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:41:35*

assume normal solar production aligned with National Weather Service historical data for Philadelphia, PA

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:41:48*

For Philadelphia, PA, assuming normal solar production aligned with the National Weather Service's historical data, we'd expect the solar panels to be quite effective in September. This period typically has a good number of sunny days, allowing the solar system to perform near its optimal capacity, especially during the peak hours of 2 to 6 pm. This would result in a noticeable reduction in both the peak demand charges and the overall energy consumption on the bill.

---

**You:**

*2024-02-02 09:42:11*

can you extrapolate the table to an annual analysis?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:42:35*

An annual analysis would require considering seasonal variations in both energy consumption and solar production. Factors like shorter days in winter, potential snow cover on panels, and higher energy usage for heating would be balanced against longer summer days and potentially higher cooling costs. The table below provides a rough annual extrapolation, assuming the September solar efficiency and production levels are representative of an average month and adjusting for less effective winter months:

| Charge Type       | Current Annual Cost ($0.063/kWh) | With Solar & Efficiency 1.25 ($0.063/kWh) |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Peak Demand Cost  | $28,140.96 (12 x $2,345.08)      | Significantly Reduced                     |
| Energy Cost       | $130,862.16 (12 x $10,905.18)    | $91,603.44 (12 x $7,633.62)               |
| Total Annual Cost | $159,003.12                      | Significantly Lower                       |

This table assumes solar production remains consistently beneficial throughout the year, which may not be the case. Actual annual savings could vary, especially due to seasonal changes affecting solar efficiency and energy consumption patterns. For precise figures, a detailed month-by-month analysis considering these factors is recommended.

I am currently experiencing technical issues that prevent me from creating the table with the specifics you requested. However, I can guide you through the process of how to calculate it manually:

1. **Demand Savings**:
   - To calculate the demand savings, you need to know the demand reduction during peak hours (2 to 6 pm) attributable to solar production. Since solar panels produce more during these hours, if we assume solar production covers the peak demand completely, the savings would be the entire demand charge. For September, this is reflected in the 'Demand' and 'Delivery Service Demand' columns.
   
2. **Energy Charge Reduction**:
   - With the solar efficiency factor of 1.25, the solar panels will produce more energy than their rated output during peak sunlight hours. You will calculate the total solar production in kWh for September, apply the efficiency factor, and subtract this from the total kWh to determine the net energy use.

3. **Total Bill Calculation**:
   - Once you have the net energy use, multiply this by the energy rate ($0.063/kWh) to find the new energy charge. Add any fixed charges such as 'Customer Charge' and 'MD USC' to this to get the new total bill.

4. **Comparison**:
   - To demonstrate the savings, you can subtract the new total bill from the original total bill for September.

Once the technical issue is resolved, I can assist you in generating a precise table with these calculations.

To calculate how much solar production will offset peak demand charges, we need to know the specific peak hours for multifamily rates set by BGE (Baltimore Gas and Electric). Typically, these peak hours are during the afternoon when solar production is also at its peak. However, without the specific peak hours from BGE, I will assume a common peak period of 2 pm to 6 pm for the purpose of this analysis.

Here’s how the calculation would work:

1. **Determine the Peak Demand Reduction**: If solar production occurs during the BGE peak hours, we need to calculate the amount of power produced by the solar panels during these hours and subtract it from the original peak demand.

2. **Calculate the New Peak Demand Charges**: Using the reduced peak demand figure, we multiply it by the peak demand rate to get the new peak demand charges.

3. **Account for Solar Production**: We must ensure that the solar production is within the peak demand timeframe to offset the demand charges correctly.

Given the data provided, we can't directly calculate the savings without the specific peak demand rate and without knowing how the 15-minute interval demand (kW) coincides with the solar production intervals. However, for the sake of this example, we will assume that all solar production occurs during the peak period and offsets the demand proportionally.

Let's proceed with the calculation under these assumptions.

It seems there's an internal issue preventing me from running the calculations. Let me try again.

I apologize for the inconvenience. There appears to be a persistent technical issue that is preventing the execution of the calculations. 

While I am unable to run the calculation at this time, I can guide you on how to do it:

1. **Calculate Daily Solar Production During Peak Hours**: Divide the monthly solar production by the number of days in the month and then by 24 to get the hourly production. Multiply this by the number of peak hours in a day to find the daily production during peak hours.

2. **Adjust for Solar Efficiency Factor**: Multiply the daily solar production during peak hours by the solar efficiency factor (1.25) to account for the increased production during peak periods.

3. **Determine Peak Demand Reduction**: If the adjusted solar production during peak hours is greater than the peak demand, the solar system would offset the entire peak demand. Otherwise, subtract the solar production from the peak demand to find the reduction.

4. **Calculate the New Peak Demand Charges**: Multiply the reduced peak demand by the peak demand rate provided by BGE.

5. **Calculate Savings**: Subtract the new peak demand charges from the original to find the savings.

You can use a spreadsheet tool like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to perform these calculations. If you'd like to attempt this calculation again when the technical issues are resolved, I'd be happy to assist you.

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:56:29*

To calculate how much solar production will offset the peak demand charges for a location in Hanover, MD, with BGE (Baltimore Gas and Electric) as the utility, we need to consider BGE's peak hours for multifamily rates. Unfortunately, the specific peak hours for multifamily rates are not provided in the spreadsheet. To accurately assess the offset, we would need to know the peak hours applicable to the multifamily rates.

However, I can provide a general approach for calculating the potential offset:

1. **Determine BGE's Multifamily Peak Hours**: You'll need to obtain the exact peak hours for multifamily rates from BGE. These hours can vary, and BGE should provide this information.

2. **Match Solar Production to Peak Hours**: Once you have the peak hours, you can match the solar production data to those hours for each month. Calculate the total solar production during those peak hours.

3. **Calculate Peak Demand Reduction**: Subtract the solar production during peak hours from the corresponding demand charges for each month. This will give you the reduction in peak demand charges due to solar production.

4. **Sum Up the Reductions**: Finally, sum up the reductions for all months to find the total reduction in peak demand charges over the year.

Please provide the specific peak hours for multifamily rates from BGE, and I can assist further with the calculations.

**Assistant:**

*2024-02-02 09:56:46*

Great, with the assumption of peak hours from 2 to 6 pm, we can calculate how much the solar production will offset the peak demand charges for each month. Here's the analysis:

1. **Calculate Solar Production During Peak Hours**: We'll calculate the solar production during the 2-6 pm peak hours for each month based on the provided solar production data.

2. **Calculate Peak Demand Reduction**: The solar production during peak hours will reduce the peak demand charges for each month. We'll calculate this reduction by multiplying the solar production during peak hours by the rate applicable to peak demand charges.

3. **Sum Up the Reductions**: Finally, we'll sum up the reductions for all months to find the total reduction in peak demand charges over the year.

Let's proceed with the calculations:

I apologize for the error encountered while performing the calculations. It seems there was an issue with the calculations due to the rate of electricity not being specified in the spreadsheet. To provide an accurate estimate of the peak demand reduction, I need the rate of electricity that BGE charges for peak demand during the 2-6 pm hours.

If you can provide the specific rate (in $/kW) for peak demand charges during those hours, I can proceed with the calculations.

Thank you for providing the average rate per kWh ($0.19). We can now proceed with calculating how much the solar production will offset the peak demand charges for each month, assuming peak hours from 2 to 6 pm. Here's the updated analysis:

1. **Calculate Solar Production During Peak Hours**: We'll calculate the solar production during the 2-6 pm peak hours for each month based on the provided solar production data.

2. **Calculate Peak Demand Reduction**: The solar production during peak hours will reduce the peak demand charges for each month. We'll calculate this reduction by multiplying the solar production during peak hours by the rate applicable to peak demand charges ($0.19/kWh).

3. **Sum Up the Reductions**: Finally, we'll sum up the reductions for all months to find the total reduction in peak demand charges over the year.

Let's proceed with the calculations:
