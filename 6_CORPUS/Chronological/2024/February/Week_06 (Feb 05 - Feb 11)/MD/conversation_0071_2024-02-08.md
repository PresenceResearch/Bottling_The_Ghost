In Maryland, virtual net metering is considered a mechanism for implementing community solar systems. Community solar in Maryland is described as a form of virtual net energy metering, where consumers receive energy credits on their local utility bills for energy produced off-site but within the same electric utility service area. The Maryland Public Service Commission has authorized specific subscriber organizations to participate in the community solar pilot program, which uses virtual net metering as its operational vehicle【0†source】【1†source】.

Virtual net metering allows electric customers in Maryland to receive credits on their utility bill from solar projects not located on their property, such as community solar farms. This system benefits subscribers by allowing them to receive virtual net metering credits based on the production of their share of the solar farm, similar to traditional net metering but without the requirement for the solar panels to be located on-site【3†source】.

Therefore, virtual net metering in Maryland is directly associated with community solar systems, providing a structured way for residents to participate in and benefit from solar energy production even if they cannot or choose not to install solar panels on their own property.

what about if it is on the same site with the same ratepayer paying bills with separate accounts?

When virtual net metering is used on the same site with the same ratepayer paying bills across separate accounts, the situation might slightly differ from the typical community solar model. In Maryland, net metering policies generally allow for the physical or virtual aggregation of meters. This means that if there are multiple meters on a single property or for a single entity (ratepayer), these meters can be consolidated virtually for the purposes of net metering. This would allow the electricity generated by a solar system on the property to be credited across multiple accounts held by the same ratepayer.

This setup is often used in scenarios such as campuses, multi-tenant buildings, or businesses with multiple meters. The key advantage is that it enables a single solar installation to benefit multiple accounts, which can be especially beneficial for managing energy costs across different parts of an organization or property owned by the same entity.

However, specific details, such as eligibility criteria, the process for setting up such an arrangement, and any limitations on the size of the solar system relative to the aggregated load of the meters, may be subject to the rules set forth by the Maryland Public Service Commission and the specific policies of the local utility company. Entities interested in this setup should directly consult with their utility company and review the Maryland Public Service Commission's regulations to understand the exact requirements and procedures for aggregating meters under a single solar project within the same site for the same ratepayer.
