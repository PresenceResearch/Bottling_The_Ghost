please create a spreadsheet calculating demand charges for PEPCO commercial electricity customers

To calculate demand charges for PEPCO (Potomac Electric Power Company) commercial electricity customers, we need to understand the structure of demand charges as they typically depend on the highest rate of electricity usage recorded during a specific period (usually a 15-minute interval) within the billing cycle. These charges are separate from energy charges, which are based on the total amount of electricity (kWh) consumed during the billing period.

Demand charges are calculated using the peak demand (kW) measured within the billing cycle. The formula for demand charges can generally be represented as:

```
Demand Charges = Peak Demand (kW) * Demand Rate ($/kW)
```

For the purpose of this spreadsheet, we'll include columns for:
- Date of Peak Demand
- Time of Peak Demand
- Peak Demand (kW)
- Demand Rate ($/kW)
- Total Demand Charges ($)

This structure allows for tracking peak demand occurrences and calculating the corresponding charges based on the applicable demand rate.

Let's create a sample spreadsheet with fictional data to demonstrate how these calculations might look.

Here's a sample spreadsheet calculating demand charges for PEPCO commercial electricity customers with fictional data:

| Date of Peak Demand | Time of Peak Demand | Peak Demand (kW) | Demand Rate ($/kW) | Total Demand Charges ($) |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 2024-02-01          | 14:00               | 120              | 15                 | 1800                     |
| 2024-02-15          | 10:30               | 150              | 15                 | 2250                     |
| 2024-03-01          | 13:45               | 130              | 15                 | 1950                     |

In this example, the demand rate is assumed to be $15 per kW, and the total demand charges are calculated by multiplying the peak demand by the demand rate. This spreadsheet can be customized with actual data, including varying demand rates if applicable, to accurately calculate demand charges for any given billing period.
