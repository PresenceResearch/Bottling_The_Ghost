Subject: Update on Project Costs Due to Scope Change and Material Cost Increases

Dear [Customer's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with an important update regarding the financial aspects of our ongoing project, specifically concerning a change in the project scope and recent developments in material costs.

Firstly, I want to express our sincere appreciation for your continued partnership and trust in our services. It has always been our priority to deliver exceptional quality while maintaining transparency in our operations.

As we progressed with your project, we encountered some necessary adjustments in the project scope. These changes, although essential for achieving the desired outcome, have inevitably led to an increase in the resources and time required for completion.

Additionally, in the current economic climate, we have experienced an unforeseen increase in the cost of materials. This rise is beyond our control and has affected the industry as a whole, leading to adjustments in project costing.

Consequently, these factors have resulted in a revised estimate for the completion of your project. The new project cost reflects these unavoidable changes in scope and material expenses. We assure you that this adjustment is critical for maintaining the quality and value of the work we are committed to delivering.

We understand that this news may come as a surprise, and we are more than willing to discuss this in further detail at your earliest convenience. Our team is prepared to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the changes and how they impact the project's budget.

Your satisfaction and the success of this project remain our top priorities. We are committed to working closely with you to navigate these changes and ensure that the final outcome meets your expectations.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or to set up a meeting to discuss this further. We value your understanding and are dedicated to making this process as smooth as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. We look forward to successfully completing this project together.

Best regards,
