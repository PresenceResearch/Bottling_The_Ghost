The requirements for telemetry in solar installations by Pepco in Maryland are not explicitly detailed in the available resources. However, I found some relevant information about Pepco's policies and programs that may indirectly relate to solar installations:

1. **Net Metering**: Pepco customers who generate their own electricity, such as through solar panels, can receive bill credits for any excess power generated. This involves using a special net-capable meter to measure the difference between energy used from the grid and power generated by the solar panel system. There's a cap on the amount of solar that can subscribe to net metering, with individual systems in Maryland capped at 2 MW and limited to meeting 200% of baseline annual customer energy use【6†source】.

2. **Business Programs and Incentives**: For business customers, Pepco offers instant discounts on lighting and HVAC measures through local distributors. They also have a Building Tune-up program that offers cash incentives for maintaining existing equipment, and a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) program, which requires that CHP-generated electricity be used by the host facility and that the facility be energy-efficient. The CHP system must be at least 65% efficient, and the facility must satisfy all utility, regulatory, and environmental requirements【7†source】.

While these details provide some context about Pepco's approach to renewable energy and efficiency, they do not specifically address telemetry requirements for solar installations. It would be advisable to contact Pepco directly or consult with a professional solar installer in Maryland for the most accurate and detailed requirements regarding telemetry for solar installations.
