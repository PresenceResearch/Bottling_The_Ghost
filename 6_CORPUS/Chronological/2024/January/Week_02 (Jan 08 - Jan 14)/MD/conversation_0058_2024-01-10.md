In Baltimore County, there are three main waste drop-off centers where residents can take residential trash and recyclables, and they should be accessible for a U-Haul truck:

1. **Eastern Sanitary Landfill Solid Waste Management Facility in White Marsh**
   - Address: 6259 Days Cove Road, White Marsh, Maryland 21162
   - Hours: Monday to Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
   - Contact: 410-887-2000

2. **Central Acceptance Facility (CAF) in Cockeysville**
   - Address: 201 West Warren Road, Cockeysville, Maryland 21030
   - Hours: Monday to Saturday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
   - Contact: 410-887-2000

3. **Western Acceptance Facility (WAF) in Halethorpe**
   - Address: 3310 Transway Road, Halethorpe, Maryland 21227
   - Hours: Monday to Saturday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
   - Contact: 410-887-2000

Residents can typically dispose of trash at these facilities without charge, provided they have proof of residence. However, if you're using a vehicle that's larger than a standard pickup truck, like a U-Haul truck, you may need to obtain a refuse disposal authorization in advance. If you don't get this authorization, you might be charged a prorated fee of $100 per ton of material. The authorization is also required if you're delivering waste that could be construed as commercial, or if you're making more than two loads in any size vehicle within a week, or more than six loads in a calendar year.

To request a refuse disposal authorization, you should contact the Bureau of Solid Waste Management with information about the type of material you're disposing of, the number of loads you anticipate, and the details of the vehicle you'll be using. This can be done via email to solidwaste@baltimorecountymd.gov or by phone at 410-887-2000. The process may take up to 14 business days, so it's advisable to plan ahead.

For more detailed information and specific directions to these facilities, you can visit the Baltimore County website.
