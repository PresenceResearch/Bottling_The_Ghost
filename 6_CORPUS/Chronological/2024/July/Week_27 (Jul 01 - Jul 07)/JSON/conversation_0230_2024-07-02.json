Customer Obligations.  \n   \n</p>\n<p>a.       Customer shall disclose to Lumina, in writing, no later than 10 days after the Effective Date, \nall known conditions, and conditions not known but reasonably suspected by Customer, on the \nProperty and anticipated Project Locations.  Customer\u2019s obligation to disclose includes disclosures \nwith respect to Hazardous Substances. \n \nb.

Lumina shall submit invoices to Customer for amounts then \ndue and owing, and Customer shall pay all such amounts no later than 21 days after delivery of \nsuch invoices, except to the extent Customer in good faith disputes that any portion of the items \nstated in the invoice are due and payable, in which event Customer shall pay the portion of the \ninvoice that is not disputed.  \n \nc.       Customer shall pay, as and when required by Lumina, any amounts due and owing for \nwarranty Work as required under this Contract. \n \nd.       Customer shall be responsible to pay all Taxes incurred in connection with the performance \nof the Work and with respect to the Project.  The \u201cTotal Price\u201d excludes such amounts.

Customer shall remove floor coverings, and any other obstacles or hazards, as determined \nand identified by Lumina, that impede or impair Lumina\u2019s performance of the Work.

Customer shall reasonably and timely assist Lumina in performance of the Work (e.g., assist \nwith permit applications, interconnection efforts, access to the Property, etc.). \n \n</p>\n<p>14.               Other Customer Obligations.  Customer agrees to: (a) notify Lumina immediately upon \ndiscovery of an emergency condition relating to the System, damage to the System, or theft of the \nSystem; (b) notify Lumina before expiration of the warranty period identified in Section 19.a within a \nreasonable time period if Customer discovers that any component of the Systems are not producing \nelectricity or otherwise appears not to be functioning as intended; (c) only have the System repaired </p>\n<p />\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\n<p>Page 8 of 24 \n \n</p>\n<p>pursuant to the Limited Warranty described in Section 19; (d) not do anything, permit or allow to exist \nany condition or circumstance at the Property which would cause the System not to operate as \nintended; and (e) permit Lumina, after providing reasonable notice, to inspect the System for proper \noperation, and to make any necessary repairs.

If any design Work requires delivery of any submittal to the Customer, then the \nCustomer shall make reasonable efforts to review such submittal and provide comments (or approvals) \nto Lumina within a reasonable time, not to exceed five (5) business days after delivery by Lumina \nprovided that the notice by Lumina indicates that the proposal would be deemed approved if no \nobjection is made to Lumina within five (5) business days.  If Customer has not responded within such \nfive (5) business day period, then every day of delay shall be deemed a delay by Customer and shall \nextend, day by day, the period for completion of the Project under this Contract .  Lumina shall \nundertake to rectify the design materials and documents and resubmit for the Customer\u2019s review, \ncomment and approval, as appropriate (determined by Lumina in its discretion), giving due \nconsideration to such comments and making reasonable changes or corrections as may be required or \nrequested by the Customer; provided, however, that Lumina shall be under no obligation to \naccommodate any comment, request or requirement that is not consistent with applicable standards, \ngood industry practices, or applicable Law. \n \n16.               Past Due Payment Policy.  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Lumina, Customer \nunderstands that payment in full is due at each milestone listed on the first page of this Contract.  Late \npayments shall accrue at the lower of (a) one percent (2%) per month and (b) the maximum rate of \ninterest allowed under Law.  In the event the account is turned over to an attorney for collection, \nCustomer shall pay interest charges on the amount that then remains unpaid under this Contract. If any \nlegal action or other proceedings is brought for a breach of this Contract, the prevailing party shall be \nentitled to recover its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs incurred in bringing such action or \nproceeding, in addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled.

Lumina shall notify the Customer when the Project has achieved \nSubstantial Completion.  Lumina shall provide the Customer the Punch List and any other information \ndeemed reasonably necessary by Lumina to demonstrate achievement of Substantial Completion.  \nPromptly following the date of Substantial Completion, Lumina shall commence and complete those \nportion of the Work on the Punch List so as to achieve the Operational Date. \n </p>\n<p />\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\n<p>Page 9 of 24 \n \n</p>\n<p>18.               Change Orders.  Any and all changes to the Work shall be agreed upon bilaterally via \naddendum or amendment to this Contract.  The occurrence of any event or occurrence under this \nSection 18 shall be a basis for a change to the Work for which the Customer is responsible to adjust the \ncosts and or timeline for completion of the Work.  Any cost relief to which Lumina is entitled shall be net \nof insurance proceeds actually received, to be accounted in arrears. \n</p>\n<p>a.       Site Conditions/Preparations.  \ni.         If after the Work has commenced, Lumina discovers any subsurface, latent or \notherwise unanticipated site conditions at or near the Properties that will impair, prevent, \nor increase the cost or timeline to perform the Work or otherwise to complete the Project, \nthen (A) Lumina may, within ten (10) business days of such discovery, unilaterally rescind \nthis Contract with no liability to the Customer whatsoever, excepting that Lumina shall \nrefund all deposits paid to Lumina reduced by any then-non-refundable third-party \nexpenses actually incurred by Lumina until such date of rescission; or (B) if Customer and \nLumina agree, the Total Price shall be renegotiated to reflect the true cost and timeline for \nthe Work. If Lumina has the right to rescind the Contract pursuant to this Section 18ai and \nfails to do so within ten (10) business days, Lumina shall be deemed to have waived the \nright to rescind this Contract under this Section 18ai.  \nii.       If after Customer discloses all known or suspected conditions under Section 13.a, and \nsuch disclosures differ materially from those used or reasonably assumed by Lumina in \npreparation of the Total Price, then the parties shall work in good faith to revise the Total \nPrice to account for such conditions.  If the parties are unable to agree on such revised \nTotal Price, then (A) Lumina may, within ten (10) business days of such disclosure by \nCustomer, unilaterally rescind this Contract with no liability to the Customer whatsoever, \nexcepting that Lumina shall refund all deposits paid to Lumina reduced by any then non-\nrefundable third-party expenses actually incurred by Lumina until such date of rescission. \niii.     For avoidance of doubt, (i) \u201csite conditions\u201d include both conditions of the Property \nand of any structures on or near the Property, and (ii) \u201csite conditions\u201d excludes Pre-\nExisting Hazardous Substances. If Lumina has the right to rescind the Contract pursuant to \nthis Section 18aiii and fails to do so within ten (10) business days, Lumina shall be deemed \nto have waived the right to rescind this Contract under this Section 18aiii.  \n \n</p>\n<p>b.       Force Majeure.  Lumina shall be entitled, and not be deemed in default of this Contract, to \ncost and or timeline relief for any delay or failure in the performance under this Contract if the \ndelay or failure is due to any Force Majeure.   In  the event that Lumina intends to assert that an \nevent of Force Majeure has occurred, Lumina shall notify Customer of the onset of such event of \nForce Majeure within ten (10) business days of the onset of such Event of Force Majeure, \ndescribing the Force Majeure and reasonable alternative measures that Lumina has taken and \nproposes to take in order to avoid the effect of such Force Majeure on Lumina\u2019s ability to \nfulfill its obligations under this Contract and to mitigate the consequences thereof, and the \nnature and expected duration of such Force Majeure. In the event that Lumina fails to notify \nCustomer of the occurrence of a Force Majeure event within ten (10) business days after \nlearning of such Force Majeure event, Lumina shall be barred from invoking such Force Majeure </p>\n<p />\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\n<p>Page 10 of 24 \n \n</p>\n<p>as the reason for Lumina\u2019s failure to perform. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance \nof any Force Majeure, the Parties shall endeavor to continue to perform their obligations \nunder this Contract so far as reasonably practicable, and Lumina shall during the period of such \ncircumstances protect and secure the Work in such manner as the Customer may reasonably \nrequire. \n \nc.       Pre-Existing Hazardous Substances.  If after the Work has commenced, Lumina encounters \nany Pre-Existing Hazardous Substances, regardless as to whether disclosed by Customer under \nSection 13.a, at or near the Properties that will impair, prevent, or increase the cost or timeline \nto perform the Work or otherwise to complete the Project, then (a) Lumina may, within ten (10) \nbusiness days of such disclosure by Customer, unilaterally rescind this Contract with no liability to \nthe Customer whatsoever, excepting that Lumina shall refund all deposits paid to Lumina \nreduced by any then non-refundable third-party expenses actually incurred by Lumina until such \ndate of rescission; or (b) if Customer and Lumina agree, the Contract Price may be renegotiated \nto reflect the true cost and timeline for the Work; provided, however, that if the parties agree \nthat Lumina shall continue with the Work, (i) as between Lumina and the Customer, the \nCustomer shall be deemed the \u201cgenerator\u201d for purposes of applicable Law, (ii) the Customer shall \nbear all costs and expenses, and shall be solely liable for any response, removal, investigation, \ncleanup, or other remedial action required by applicable Laws with respect to any Pre-Existing \nHazardous Substance, and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Customer \nshall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lumina and its affiliates, and Lumina\u2019s agents, \nsubcontractors, and vendors (and each of their respective affiliates) from and against any and all \nlosses, arising out of, or resulting from, or occasioned by or in connection with a Pre-Existing \nHazardous Substance or any Hazardous Substance introduced, released, or spilled in, to, under, \nor from the Properties after Lumina commences the Work by any party other than Lumina or its \nsubcontractors and vendors performing the Work, except to the extent such losses result from, \nor have been increased by, the deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disruption, release or \nexacerbation of any Pre-Existing Hazardous Substance or the rendering of the removal or \nremediation of Pre-Existing Hazardous Material more costly, by or on behalf of Lumina. If Lumina \nhas the right to rescind the Contract pursuant to this Section 18c and fails to do so within ten (10) \nbusiness days, Lumina shall be deemed to have waived the right to rescind this Contract under \nthis Section 18c.  \n</p>\n<p> \nd.       Project Schedule and Weather delays.  Lumina will make a daily decision on whether \nweather or other conditions are suitable for performance of the Work.  Lumina will give the \nCustomer reasonable notice of any decision to delay the Work.  Any such decision to delay shall \nserve to add a commensurate number of days to Lumina\u2019s commitments in the timeline listed on \nthe first page of this Contract. \n \n</p>\n<p>19.               Warranties: </p>\n<p />\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\n<p>Page 11 of 24 \n \n</p>\n<p>a.       5 Year Lumina Solar Limited Warranty on Parts (other than under Sections 19b and 19c) and \nLabor on Installation, measured from the date of Substantial Completion.  Lumina\u2019s warranty \nunder this Section 19a is as follows: \n</p>\n<p>i.         Lumina warrants that (i) all installation hardware, brackets and supports, and all \nother  parts and equipment (other than those identified under Sections 19b and 19c) that \nare furnished by Lumina as part of the Work performed under this Contract shall be free \nfrom defects in workmanship and materials suitable for Customer\u2019s use as commercial \nsolar electricity-generating facility for no less than 5 years, subject to normal wear and tear \nand maintenance and operation requirements and obsolescence that may result from \nadvance in technology or other changes in needs or uses, under the climatic and normal \noperating conditions at the Properties, and otherwise in compliance with the standards of \nperformance set forth in this Contract; (ii) all aspects of the Work (A) shall be performed in \na good and workmanlike manner according to industry standards, applicable Laws and \nrequired permitting and utility standards and regulations, and (B) conform to and be \ndesigned and installed in accordance with and conformance to the System Specifications.  \nii.       As part of this warranty, Lumina will service any materials manufacturer\u2019s warranty \nfor the duration of Lumina\u2019s aforementioned 5-year warranty period. \niii.     Also as part of this warranty, and only if the Project Locations are wholly or partially \non Customer\u2019s roof, Lumina will repair any damage to Customer\u2019s roof caused specifically \nby a roofing penetration made by Lumina in performing the Work; provided, however, that \nCustomer shall specifically notify Lumina of any such damage within a reasonable period of \ntime after Customer has knowledge of such damage (not to exceed 4 months after \nSubstantial Completion) or this particular warranty is hereby void. \niv.     The warranty does not, however, guarantee that the completed Project shall perform \nas explicitly described or implied in this Contract.  Lumina shall have no obligation to \nperform under this warranty until Customer has made full payment for the Work.  The \nmaximum period of Lumina\u2019s warranty shall be from Substantial Completion until \nexpiration of 5 years thereafter, and late full payment shall not serve to extend Lumina\u2019s \nwarranty beyond such 5-year period.  By way of example, if the Customer makes full \npayment 1 year following Substantial Completion, (a) Lumina shall have no obligation to \nperform any warranty services prior to such date, and (b) Lumina\u2019s warranty shall \neffectively exist for nine years. \n \n</p>\n<p>Lumina\u2019s warranty under this Section 19a excludes (1) any remedy for damage or defect caused by \nabuse, modifications not executed by or on behalf of Lumina or any of its subcontractors, improper or \ninsufficient maintenance, improper operation, or normal wear and tear under normal usage, (2) any \nremedy for damages or defect in the quality or workmanship of any materials or equipment furnished \nby Customer or any other third party other than a subcontractor or sub-subcontractor of Lumina or any \nvendor for Lumina or any subcontractor or sub-subcontractor, (3) power outages or damages to the \nProject or to the Property arising out of or relating to power outages; (4) damages arising out of or \nrelating to any event of Force Majeure;  and (5) damages in the nature of normal wear and tear to the \nProject or to the roof or other site of the Project, sub-structure, siding, plumbing or electrical work not </p>\n<p />\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\n<p>Page 12 of 24 \n \n</p>\n<p>related to the Project.  \n   \n</p>\n<p>b.       25 Year Limited Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty on [Solar Module Performance] (documentation \nfor which to be provided by Lumina to Customer upon Customer\u2019s request); and \n \nc.       12 Year Limited Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty on [Inverters &amp; DC Optimizers] \n(documentation for which to be provided by Lumina to Customer upon Customer\u2019s request). \n \nd.       Lumina\u2019s warranty under Sections 19b and 19c are only to the extent, and subject to the \nterms and conditions within, such manufacturers\u2019 respective limited warranties, and the \nCustomer acknowledges that Lumina\u2019s warranty under Section 19a does not, and shall not be \nconstrued, to supplement or be in lieu of such manufacturers\u2019 limited warranties. \n \ne.       Remedies. \n</p>\n<p>i.         Customer\u2019s sole remedy under this Section 19 is to require, by notice received by \nLumina on or before expiration of the warranty period described in Section 19a, and at no \ncost to the Customer (except as stated below), that Lumina repair or replace, or cause to \nbe repaired or replaced, that portion or portions of the Work pursuant to this Warranty so \nas to restore the Project to the condition as installed by or on behalf of Lumina.  \nii.       If in responding to any timely warranty notice, Lumina discovers that the issue is not \ncovered by any of the warranties under this Section 19 (such as by reason of shade and \nalterations other than by Lumina), Lumina shall so notify Customer of such fact and the \nreason such item is not covered and, before effecting any repairs, and await instructions \nfrom Customer.  In the event Lumina has informed Customer that the matter is not \ncovered by warranty and Customer elects to cause Lumina to effect repairs, then to the \nextent a remedy is available (e.g., repair to Project, but not removal of shade), Customer \nwill pay for any materials, equipment or other components or parts, and Lumina reserves \nthe right to charge Customer a service charge of $100 per hour with the minimum service \ncharge equal to $200.  \niii.     Until expiration of the warranty period described in Section 19a, Lumina shall be \nresponsible for enforcing the warranties of all manufacturers and subcontractors, if any.  \nAt and after expiration of such period, the Customer shall be responsible for enforcing any \nwarranties (including those under Sections 19b and 19c). \n \n</p>\n<p>f.        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the foregoing warranties reflect \nLumina\u2019s and the Customer\u2019s agreement with respect to the Project, and (i) Lumina hereby \ndisclaims, and (ii) the Customer hereby waives any other warranty or remedy, express or implied \nunder applicable Law, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or \notherwise as relates to recourse to Lumina at Law or in equity.  Nothing in this Section 19f waives \nany remedy at Law or in equity as relates to any manufacturer of equipment or parts that are part \nof the Work. \n </p>\n<p />\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\n<p>Page 13 of 24 \n \n</p>\n<p>20.

Lumina\u2019s warranty \nunder this Section 19a is as follows: \n</p>\n<p>i.         Lumina warrants that (i) all installation hardware, brackets and supports, and all \nother  parts and equipment (other than those identified under Sections 19b and 19c) that \nare furnished by Lumina as part of the Work performed under this Contract shall be free \nfrom defects in workmanship and materials suitable for Customer\u2019s use as commercial \nsolar electricity-generating facility for no less than 5 years, subject to normal wear and tear \nand maintenance and operation requirements and obsolescence that may result from \nadvance in technology or other changes in needs or uses, under the climatic and normal \noperating conditions at the Properties, and otherwise in compliance with the standards of \nperformance set forth in this Contract; (ii) all aspects of the Work (A) shall be performed in \na good and workmanlike manner according to industry standards, applicable Laws and \nrequired permitting and utility standards and regulations, and (B) conform to and be \ndesigned and installed in accordance with and conformance to the System Specifications.  \nii.       As part of this warranty, Lumina will service any materials manufacturer\u2019s warranty \nfor the duration of Lumina\u2019s aforementioned 5-year warranty period. \niii.     Also as part of this warranty, and only if the Project Locations are wholly or partially \non Customer\u2019s roof, Lumina will repair any damage to Customer\u2019s roof caused specifically \nby a roofing penetration made by Lumina in performing the Work; provided, however, that \nCustomer shall specifically notify Lumina of any such damage within a reasonable period of \ntime after Customer has knowledge of such damage (not to exceed 4 months after \nSubstantial Completion) or this particular warranty is hereby void. \niv.     The warranty does not, however, guarantee that the completed Project shall perform \nas explicitly described or implied in this Contract.  Lumina shall have no obligation to \nperform under this warranty until Customer has made full payment for the Work.  The \nmaximum period of Lumina\u2019s warranty shall be from Substantial Completion until \nexpiration of 5 years thereafter, and late full payment shall not serve to extend Lumina\u2019s \nwarranty beyond such 5-year period.

Lumina\u2019s warranty \nunder this Section 19a is as follows: \n</p>\n<p>i.         Lumina warrants that (i) all installation hardware, brackets and supports, and all \nother  parts and equipment (other than those identified under Sections 19b and 19c) that \nare furnished by Lumina as part of the Work performed under this Contract shall be free \nfrom defects in workmanship and materials suitable for Customer\u2019s use as commercial \nsolar electricity-generating facility for no less than 5 years, subject to normal wear and tear \nand maintenance and operation requirements and obsolescence that may result from \nadvance in technology or other changes in needs or uses, under the climatic and normal \noperating conditions at the Properties, and otherwise in compliance with the standards of \nperformance set forth in this Contract; (ii) all aspects of the Work (A) shall be performed in \na good and workmanlike manner according to industry standards, applicable Laws and \nrequired permitting and utility standards and regulations, and (B) conform to and be \ndesigned and installed in accordance with and conformance to the System Specifications.  \nii.       As part of this warranty, Lumina will service any materials manufacturer\u2019s warranty \nfor the duration of Lumina\u2019s aforementioned 5-year warranty period. \niii.     Also as part of this warranty, and only if the Project Locations are wholly or partially \non Customer\u2019s roof, Lumina will repair any damage to Customer\u2019s roof caused specifically \nby a roofing penetration made by Lumina in performing the Work; provided, however, that \nCustomer shall specifically notify Lumina of any such damage within a reasonable period of \ntime after Customer has knowledge of such damage (not to exceed 4 months after \nSubstantial Completion) or this particular warranty is hereby void. \niv.     The warranty does not, however, guarantee that the completed Project shall perform \nas explicitly described or implied in this Contract.  Lumina shall have no obligation to \nperform under this warranty until Customer has made full payment for the Work.  The \nmaximum period of Lumina\u2019s warranty shall be from Substantial Completion until \nexpiration of 5 years thereafter, and late full payment shall not serve to extend Lumina\u2019s \nwarranty beyond such 5-year period.  By way of example, if the Customer makes full \npayment 1 year following Substantial Completion, (a) Lumina shall have no obligation to \nperform any warranty services prior to such date, and (b) Lumina\u2019s warranty shall \neffectively exist for nine years.\n",
