The best temperature to wash jeans is typically cold water. Washing jeans in cold water helps to prevent fading and shrinking, and it also preserves the fabric's integrity. If your jeans are heavily soiled, you can use warm water, but avoid hot water as it can cause significant shrinkage and fading. Always turn your jeans inside out before washing to further protect the color and fabric.
