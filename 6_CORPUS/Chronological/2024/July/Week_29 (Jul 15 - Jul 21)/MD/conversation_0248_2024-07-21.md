It depends on the context in which "high tear gas" is used. Could you clarify if you are referring to tear gas used for law enforcement, crowd control, or another context? This will help in providing a more accurate assessment of its cost-effectiveness or potential waste of money.

If you are referring to "high-test" fuel, it usually means higher-octane gasoline, often called premium gasoline. Whether using high-test fuel is a waste of money depends on several factors:

1. **Vehicle Requirements:** Some high-performance or luxury vehicles require high-octane fuel to operate efficiently and prevent engine knocking. If your vehicle manufacturer recommends or requires premium gasoline, using high-test fuel is necessary for optimal performance and longevity.

2. **Engine Performance:** Vehicles designed to run on regular gasoline will not typically see a significant improvement in performance or fuel efficiency from using high-test fuel. In these cases, spending extra on premium gasoline might be considered a waste of money.

3. **Driving Conditions:** In specific scenarios, such as high-load conditions (e.g., towing, high-speed driving), higher-octane fuel might provide benefits even for vehicles not strictly requiring it.

In summary, if your vehicle requires high-test fuel or if you experience improved performance under certain conditions, it might be worth the extra cost. Otherwise, using regular gasoline as recommended by your vehicle manufacturer is generally the most cost-effective approach.
