Yes, there are tools available that can help you transform your Gmail inbox into a Kanban board. Here are a few options you might find useful:

1. **Drag**: This is a Chrome extension that transforms your Gmail inbox into a Kanban board. You can create custom columns, drag and drop emails between columns, and manage your tasks directly within Gmail. Drag also offers features like due dates, tasks, and notes.

2. **Trello for Gmail**: While Trello itself is a separate tool, there is a Trello for Gmail add-on that allows you to create Trello cards directly from your Gmail inbox. This won't turn your inbox into a Kanban board, but it allows seamless integration with Trello, which is a popular Kanban tool.

3. **Sortd**: Sortd is another Chrome extension that turns your Gmail inbox into a Trello-style Kanban board. You can organize your emails into lists, prioritize tasks, and keep track of important emails and tasks all in one place.

4. **KanbanMail**: This tool specifically transforms your Gmail into a Kanban board, organizing your emails into columns. It's designed to be simple and effective for personal use.

These tools integrate with Gmail and provide a Kanban-style view for managing your emails and tasks. You can choose the one that best fits your needs and workflow preferences.
