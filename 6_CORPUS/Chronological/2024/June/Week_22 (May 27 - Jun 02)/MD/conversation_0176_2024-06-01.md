To prevent your ears from popping during a flight, you can try the following tips:

1. **Yawning and Swallowing:** These actions help open your eustachian tubes, which can equalize pressure in your ears.
   
2. **Chewing Gum or Sucking on Candy:** This encourages swallowing, which can help keep your ears from popping.
   
3. **The Valsalva Maneuver:** Close your mouth, pinch your nose shut, and gently blow as if blowing your nose. This can help open the eustachian tubes.
   
4. **Stay Awake During Takeoff and Landing:** Ears are more likely to pop during ascent and descent, so try to stay awake and use the above methods during these times.
   
5. **Use Earplugs:** Special earplugs designed for flying can help regulate ear pressure.

6. **Hydrate Well:** Drinking plenty of fluids can keep your mucous membranes moist and more efficient at equalizing pressure.

If you have a cold or allergies, using a decongestant or antihistamine before flying can also help prevent your ears from popping.
