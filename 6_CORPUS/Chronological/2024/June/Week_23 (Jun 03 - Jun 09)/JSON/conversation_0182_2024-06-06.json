Passengers boarding at these stations should arrive at least 10 minutes early.\n\n(R) - ONLY trains designated with an R at the top of the column will operate when limited service conditions or special circumstances warrant. On days of heavy snowfall or other severe weather, MARC will operate this special schedule. Additional stops marked with an R will be made when this schedule is in effect. See the \u301073\u2020PDF schedule\u3011 for complete R schedule details.\n\n(R+) - Train will operate or add additional stops when the R+ schedule is operated, in addition to trains with an R at the top of the column.\n\n(C) - Connecting bus operated by Eastern Panhandle Transit Authority (EPTA). You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. \u301075\u2020Click here for more details\u3011.\n\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * \u301078\u2020MDOT MTA\u2020www.mdot.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n\n  * \u301079\u2020Maryland.gov\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Phone Directory\u2020www.doit.state.md.us\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020State Agencies\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Online Services\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n\u3010",

Passengers boarding at these stations should arrive at least 10 minutes early.\n\n(R) - ONLY trains designated with an R at the top of the column will operate when limited service conditions or special circumstances warrant. On days of heavy snowfall or other severe weather, MARC will operate this special schedule. Additional stops marked with an R will be made when this schedule is in effect. See the \u301073\u2020PDF schedule\u3011 for complete R schedule details.\n\n(R+) - Train will operate or add additional stops when the R+ schedule is operated, in addition to trains with an R at the top of the column.\n\n(C) - Connecting bus operated by Eastern Panhandle Transit Authority (EPTA). You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. \u301075\u2020Click here for more details\u3011.\n\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * \u301078\u2020MDOT MTA\u2020www.mdot.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n\n  * \u301079\u2020Maryland.gov\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Phone Directory\u2020www.doit.state.md.us\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020State Agencies\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Online Services\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n\u3010",

            "To visit major sites in Washington, D.C., efficiently using public transportation from Baltimore, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Take the MARC Train from Baltimore to Washington, D.C.**:\n   - Depart from Baltimore Penn Station. Recommended departure times for an early start include the 7:38 AM or 8:02 AM trains.\n   - Arrive at Washington Union Station (approximately a 1-hour trip).\n\n2. **Start at the Capitol Building**:\n   - From Union Station, you can walk to the Capitol Building. It\u2019s about a 10-minute walk, approximately 0.5 miles south along First St NE/SW.\n\n3. **Walk Down the National Mall**:\n   - Begin at the Capitol and head west along the National Mall.\n   - Major sites you will pass include:\n     - The U.S. Capitol Building\n     - The National Gallery of Art\n     - The Smithsonian Museums (like the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of Natural History)\n     - The Washington Monument\n     - The World War II Memorial\n\n4. **End at the Lincoln Memorial**:\n   - Continue west past the Reflecting Pool until you reach the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n5. **Return to Union Station**:\n   - To get back to Union Station, you have several options:\n     - **Metro**: Walk to the nearest Metro station. The closest one near the Lincoln Memorial is the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metro Station (about a 15-20 minute walk). Take the Blue, Orange, or Silver Line to Metro Center, and transfer to the Red Line towards Glenmont or Silver Spring to Union Station.\n     - **Bus**: The DC Circulator's National Mall route runs between the Lincoln Memorial and Union Station. Check the schedule for the next bus departure.\n     - **Walk**: If you prefer, you can walk back along the National Mall, but it will take about 45 minutes to an hour depending on your pace and stops along the way.\n\n### Detailed Directions and Public Transportation Tips:\n\n- **MARC Train Schedule**: Ensure you have the latest MARC train schedule from Baltimore Penn Station to Washington Union Station. The MARC Penn Line typically runs frequently during the weekdays.\n- **Metro and Bus Info**: Use the WMATA website or apps like Moovit to get real-time information on Metro and bus services in Washington, D.C. The DC Circulator website will also provide schedules and route maps.\n\nBy following this plan, you can efficiently see the major sites in Washington, D.C., starting from the Capitol Building, walking down the National Mall, and ending at the Lincoln Memorial, while utilizing public transportation effectively."
