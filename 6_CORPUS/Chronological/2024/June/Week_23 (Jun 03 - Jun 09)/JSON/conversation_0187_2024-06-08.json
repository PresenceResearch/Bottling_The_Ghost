            "In the commercial solar sales industry, the ratio between base salary and commission can vary, but a common standard ratio is approximately 60:40 or 50:50, depending on the company and the specific compensation structure.\n\n**Typical Breakdown:**\n\n1. **60:40 Ratio**:\n   - **Base Salary**: 60% of the total compensation.\n   - **Commission**: 40% of the total compensation.\n\n   For example, if a salesperson has a target total compensation of $100,000 per year, the base salary might be around $60,000, with the remaining $40,000 coming from commission.\n\n2. **50:50 Ratio**:\n   - **Base Salary**: 50% of the total compensation.\n   - **Commission**: 50% of the total compensation.\n\n   In this case, for a target total compensation of $100,000, the base salary would be $50,000, and the commission would also be $50,000.\n\nThese ratios are designed to provide a balance between a guaranteed income and performance-based incentives, encouraging sales representatives to achieve or exceed their sales targets. High-performing salespeople can earn significantly more than their base salary through commissions and bonuses. \n\nDifferent companies may adjust these ratios slightly based on their sales strategy, market conditions, and individual performance metrics."

The state Senate\u2019s Energy and Environment Committee voted narrowly, 3-2, in favor of taking forward a bill sponsored by the committee\u2019s chair Bob Smith and vice-chair Linda Greenstein.\n\nThe bill, S-225, would establish incentives for energy storage systems which could support New Jersey\u2019s transition from centralized fossil fuel generation to a more distributed and localized system which could integrate more renewable energy while enhancing the stability of the grid.\n\n\u301043\u2020Read full article.\u2020www.energy-storage.news\u3011\n\n\u301043\u2020Read More\u2020www.energy-storage.news\u3011\n\n  * \u301039\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301039\u2020NJ GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY SIGNS HISTORIC CLEAN ENERGY BILL \u2013 5-23-18\u3011\n\nNEW JERSEY GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY SIGNS HISTORIC CLEAN ENERGY BILL May 23, South Brunswick, NJ - Today New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed a comprehensive clean energy bill that will require the state to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2030 and provide for further growth of the solar energy\u301039\u2020 [...]\u3011\n\n\u301037\u2020Richie\u30112019-07-18T17:35:16-04:00 May 23rd, 2018|\u301044\u2020Featured News\u3011|\n\n\u301039\u2020Read More\u3011\n\n## BREAKING NEWS\n\n\u301045\u2020Lyle Rawlings MSSIA 2024 Annual Meeting LKR 2-22-24small\u3011 \n\n\u301045\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301046\u2020PACE Update - MSSIA 240222\u3011 \n\n\u301046\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301047\u2020PA_Policy-MSSIAQrt-1__2.22.2024\u3011 \n\n\u301047\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301048\u2020DE Update 2.22.24 (002)\u3011 \n\n\u301048\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n## RECENT NEWS\n\n[Image 4]\n\n\u30107\u2020See All Videos & Presentations\u3011\n\n\u301049\u2020L Rawlings MSSIA Q3 Meeting 10-25-23\u3011 \n\n\u301049\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301050\u2020PA_Policy-MSSIAQrt-3__10.27.2023\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n## PAST NEWS\n\n[Image 5]\n\n\u30108\u2020Click on image for access to presentation videos and PDFs\u3011\n\n\u301051\u2020L Rawlings MSSIA Q2 Meeting 6-22-23\u3011 \n\n\u301051\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301052\u2020PA_Policy-MSSIAQrt-2__6.22.2023\u3011 \n\n\u301052\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301053\u2020L Rawlings MSSIA Annual Meeting 2-21-23\u3011 \n\n\u301053\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301054\u2020PA_Policy-MSSIAQrt-1__2.21.2023\u3011 \n\n\u301054\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301055\u2020GS C-PACE Pres 3p 230224 MSSIA\u3011 \n\n\u301055\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301056\u2020L Rawlings MSSIA Q3 Meeting 9-29-22\u3011 \n\n\u301056\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301057\u2020PACE Update - MSSIA 221029\u3011 \n\n\u301057\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301058\u2020PA_Policy-MSSIAQrt-3__9.29.2022\u3011 \n\n\u301058\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301059\u2020DE Update 9.29.22\u3011 \n\n\u301059\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301060\u2020L Rawlings MSSIA Q2 Meeting 6-30-22\u3011 \n\n\u301060\u2020Click here to enlarge\u3011\n\n\u301061\u2020PA_Policy-MSSIAQrt-2__6.30.2022\u3011 \n\n",

            "Variable compensation for a Director of Commercial Solar Business Development typically includes several components designed to reward performance and drive business growth. These components often include:\n\n1. **Performance Bonuses**: These are typically tied to achieving specific sales targets, project milestones, or overall business growth metrics. Bonuses can range from 10% to 30% of the base salary, depending on the company's compensation structure and the individual's performance.\n\n2. **Commission**: While less common for director-level positions compared to sales representatives, some directors may receive a commission based on the revenue generated from new business deals or major projects they secure. This can significantly boost their total compensation, especially in high-revenue markets.\n\n3. **Stock Options or Equity**: In many companies, especially startups and rapidly growing firms, directors might receive stock options or equity as part of their compensation package. This aligns their interests with the long-term success of the company and can be highly lucrative if the company performs well.\n\n4. **Profit Sharing**: Some organizations offer profit-sharing plans where a portion of the company's profits is distributed among key employees, including directors. This variable compensation is typically tied to the overall financial performance of the company.\n\n5. **Incentive Programs**: These can include additional incentives such as annual trips, special recognition awards, or additional financial bonuses for exceptional performance or contributions to strategic initiatives.\n\n6. **Signing Bonuses**: For highly sought-after candidates, companies may offer signing bonuses to attract top talent. These bonuses are typically a one-time payment provided upon joining the company.\n\nThese variable compensation elements are designed to incentivize high performance and align the director's goals with the company's strategic objectives."

            "Salespeople in the commercial solar industry are typically judged by a variety of metrics for their bonus structure. These metrics are designed to align their performance with the company's strategic goals and drive business growth. Common metrics include:\n\n1. **Sales Revenue**: The most straightforward metric, sales revenue, measures the total value of the deals closed by the salesperson. Higher revenue targets often result in higher bonuses.\n\n2. **Number of New Clients**: This metric focuses on the ability of the salesperson to bring in new business. It can be measured by the number of new accounts opened or new contracts signed within a specific period.\n\n3. **Project Completion**: Some compensation structures may include bonuses for successfully bringing projects to completion, ensuring that installations are done on time and within budget.\n\n4. **Profit Margin**: Salespeople might be incentivized based on the profit margins of the deals they close. This encourages them to negotiate favorable terms and focus on higher-margin projects.\n\n5. **Customer Satisfaction**: Customer satisfaction scores or Net Promoter Scores (NPS) can be used to gauge how well the salesperson maintains client relationships and delivers on customer expectations.\n\n6. **Lead Conversion Rate**: This metric measures the effectiveness of the salesperson in converting leads into paying customers. A higher conversion rate typically results in higher bonuses.\n\n7. **Quota Achievement**: Many sales roles include specific sales quotas. Bonuses are often tied to the percentage of quota achieved, with additional incentives for exceeding targets.\n\n8. **Retention and Upselling**: Metrics that focus on retaining existing customers and upselling additional services or products can also be part of the bonus structure. This includes renewing contracts or increasing the size of existing projects.\n\n9. **Pipeline Management**: Effective management of the sales pipeline, including the number of prospects in various stages of the sales process, can be a key performance indicator.\n\n10. **Team Collaboration**: In some organizations, teamwork and collaboration with other departments (such as marketing or project management) can be a metric, encouraging a holistic approach to achieving business goals.\n\nBy using a combination of these metrics, companies can ensure that their salespeople are not only focused on closing deals but also on maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction, profitability, and long-term business growth."
