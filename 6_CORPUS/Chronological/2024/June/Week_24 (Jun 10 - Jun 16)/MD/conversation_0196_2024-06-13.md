Sure, here's a little song for you:

(Verse 1)
Down in the town of old Savannah,
Lived a girl named Cookie Veronica.
She had a smile as bright as the sun,
And a harmonica that she played for fun.

(Chorus)
Oh, Cookie Veronica, play that sweet tune,
With your harmonica under the moon.
The whole town gathers when you start to play,
Bringing joy and music to brighten the day.

(Verse 2)
She'd sit by the river, under the willow tree,
Playing melodies that'd set your heart free.
With every note, the world felt right,
Cookie's harmonica lighting up the night.

(Chorus)
Oh, Cookie Veronica, play that sweet tune,
With your harmonica under the moon.
The whole town gathers when you start to play,
Bringing joy and music to brighten the day.

(Bridge)
From sunrise to sunset, her music flowed,
A symphony of love that everyone knows.
With every breath, she’d fill the air,
With the sweetest sounds, beyond compare.

(Chorus)
Oh, Cookie Veronica, play that sweet tune,
With your harmonica under the moon.
The whole town gathers when you start to play,
Bringing joy and music to brighten the day.

(Outro)
So here's to Cookie, with her harmonica bright,
She plays our hearts, every day and night.
In old Savannah, her legacy stays,
With every tune, her spirit sways.

Spreading joy from dawn till dusk.

You’ll find her playing, wild and free.
Her melodies dance on the breeze,
Bringing peace to hearts with ease.

Her harmonica echoes through the hill.

Spreading joy from dawn till dusk.

Her harmonica playing, in skies of blue.
In our little town, she’s our pride,
Cookie Veronica, our musical guide.
