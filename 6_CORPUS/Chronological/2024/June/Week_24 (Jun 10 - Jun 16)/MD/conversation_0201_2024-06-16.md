Please write a story about Cab  Calloway. Cab Calloway was invited to a late dinner by the Rat Pack in Las Vegas in the mid 50s. Please populate with correct historical references. They were at the table and Cab wanted to order a cheeseburger. As he ordered Frank Sinatra said “come on Cabby, baby. If you want that burger you gotta do better than that”. So Cab started to scat his order in the style of his greatest hit Minnie the moocher. The waiter asked “how would you like this cooked” and cab scatted Didi Doo Doop medium rare Bobbidi bop”.   The waiter then asked what he would
Like on top and he scatted “lettuce tomato pickles onion and a fried egg and bacon”. Sammy Davis Junior said “Cabby Baby!  It’s not time for breakfast yet!”  Insert historical reference of a job that Cab Calloway did before he was famous and make up a reason why he wanted bacon and eggs on his burger. The waiter brought the burger over and it looked delicious. A young Elvis Presley was sitting at a neighboring table and asked them what it was and Dean Martin said “that’s a scat burger, baby”. Say that up until this restaurant closed you could order a scat burger even though it wasn’t on the menu. It was a Las Vegas insider secret.

In the mid-1950s, Las Vegas was a playground for the stars, and none shone brighter than the Rat Pack. On a balmy evening, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. were holding court at a swanky late-night spot when they were joined by none other than the "Hi-De-Ho" man himself, Cab Calloway. The air was thick with laughter and the clinking of glasses when Cab arrived, his presence electric.

As the night wore on, the group grew hungry. Cab, never one to follow the norm, decided he wanted a cheeseburger. As he casually ordered his burger, Frank Sinatra leaned over and with a twinkle in his eye said, "Come on, Cabby, baby. If you want that burger, you gotta do better than that."

With a mischievous grin, Cab started to scat his order in the style of his greatest hit, "Minnie the Moocher." "Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho, I want a cheeseburger with everything on the go, medium rare, didi doo doop!"

The waiter, caught up in the moment, played along, asking, "And what would you like on top?"

Cab didn't miss a beat, scatting, "Lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and a fried egg and bacon, boop boop-a-doop!"

Sammy Davis Jr. chuckled, "Cabby Baby! It’s not time for breakfast yet!"

Cab laughed and explained, "Well, you know, before all this, I used to be a soda jerk back in Baltimore. Made a mean breakfast sandwich back then, and some habits just stick!"

As the waiter brought over the burger, it looked like a work of art, piled high with all the fixings. A young Elvis Presley, who was sitting at a neighboring table, looked over, intrigued by the sight. "What's that?" he asked, his eyes wide with curiosity.

Dean Martin, always quick with a quip, replied, "That's a scat burger, baby."

Word of Cab's unique order spread like wildfire through the Vegas nightlife. Though it was never officially on the menu, those in the know could always order a "scat burger." It became a Las Vegas insider secret, a nod to that unforgettable night with the Rat Pack and Cab Calloway, long after the restaurant had closed its doors.

In the mid-1950s, Las Vegas was at the height of its golden age, with the Rat Pack reigning supreme. One warm evening, the legendary Sands Hotel and Casino was buzzing with excitement. The Rat Pack—Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr.—had just finished a dazzling performance at the Copa Room, their favorite stage on the Strip. The audience's applause still echoed in their ears as they made their way to the Copa's upscale restaurant, The Garden Room, renowned for its exquisite late-night dining and celebrity sightings.

As they settled into their plush, red leather seats, the smoky haze from countless cigarettes created an intimate, almost magical atmosphere. The table was adorned with glasses of bourbon, martinis, and champagne, reflecting the opulence of the evening. Among the diners were some of the most famous women of the era: Marilyn Monroe, with her signature platinum curls and dazzling smile, and Ava Gardner, whose beauty was rivaled only by her wit.

Just as the night seemed perfect, Cab Calloway, the famed bandleader known for his "Hi-De-Ho" scatting style, joined the table. Cab was performing his electrifying show at the nearby Moulin Rouge, the first integrated casino in Las Vegas, breaking barriers and winning hearts nightly.

As the group laughed and reminisced, hunger struck, and Cab decided he wanted a cheeseburger. As he casually ordered, Frank Sinatra leaned in, his blue eyes sparkling with mischief, and said, "Come on, Cabby, baby. If you want that burger, you gotta do better than that."

Cab grinned widely and began to scat his order in the style of his greatest hit, "Minnie the Moocher." "Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho, I want a cheeseburger with everything on the go, medium rare, didi doo doop!"

The waiter, clearly entertained, asked, "And what would you like on top?"

Without missing a beat, Cab continued, "Lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and a fried egg and bacon, boop boop-a-doop!"

Sammy Davis Jr. laughed heartily, "Cabby Baby! It’s not time for breakfast yet!"

Cab chuckled and explained, "Well, you know, before all this, I used to be a soda jerk back in Baltimore. Made a mean breakfast sandwich back then, and some habits just stick!"

At a neighboring table, a young Elvis Presley was enjoying a meal with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker. The aroma and commotion drew Elvis's attention, and he leaned over, curiosity piqued. "What's that?" he asked, his voice filled with southern charm.

Dean Martin, ever the comedian, quipped, "That's a scat burger, baby."

The waiter soon returned with Cab's creation, a towering masterpiece that looked like a work of art. The burger, piled high with all the fixings, gleamed under the dim lights of The Garden Room. The sight and smell were irresistible.

Word of Cab's unique order quickly spread throughout the Vegas nightlife. Though the "scat burger" never appeared on the official menu, those in the know could always order it. It became a symbol of the wild, unpredictable nights at The Sands, a testament to the magic of Las Vegas in its heyday. Long after the restaurant closed its doors, the legend of the scat burger lived on, a cherished memory of a night when stars and scats collided in the heart of the desert.

In the early 1960s, Las Vegas was still the ultimate playground for the stars, and the Rat Pack was at the peak of their fame. One warm evening, after a spectacular performance at the Sands Hotel and Casino's Copa Room, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. decided they needed a late-night bite. They headed to The Garden Room, the upscale restaurant inside the Sands, only to find it had just closed for the night.

However, the allure of the Rat Pack was undeniable, and the staff quickly reopened the restaurant for the legendary trio. As they settled into their plush, red leather seats, the smoky haze from countless cigarettes created an intimate, almost magical atmosphere. The table was adorned with glasses of bourbon, martinis, and champagne, reflecting the opulence of the evening.
