If my PPA rate is $.149/kWh at a $2.60 install cost what would the PPA rate be at a $2.40 install cost?

To determine the PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) rate at a lower installation cost, we need to consider how the installation cost affects the overall project economics. The PPA rate is typically set to cover the installation cost, operational expenses, financing costs, and provide a return on investment.

Here's a simplified method to estimate the new PPA rate:

1. Calculate the percentage reduction in the installation cost.
2. Apply the same percentage reduction to the current PPA rate to estimate the new PPA rate.

### Step 1: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Installation Cost

\[ \text{Percentage Reduction} = \frac{\$2.60 - \$2.40}{\$2.60} \times 100 \]

### Step 2: Apply the Percentage Reduction to the Current PPA Rate

\[ \text{New PPA Rate} = \text{Current PPA Rate} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Percentage Reduction}}{100}\right) \]

Let's calculate it:

#### Step 1: Percentage Reduction
\[ \text{Percentage Reduction} = \frac{2.60 - 2.40}{2.60} \times 100 = \frac{0.20}{2.60} \times 100 \approx 7.69\% \]

#### Step 2: New PPA Rate
\[ \text{New PPA Rate} = 0.149 \times \left(1 - \frac{7.69}{100}\right) \]
\[ \text{New PPA Rate} = 0.149 \times (1 - 0.0769) \]
\[ \text{New PPA Rate} \approx 0.149 \times 0.9231 \]
\[ \text{New PPA Rate} \approx 0.1377 \]

### Result
The new PPA rate at a $2.40 install cost would be approximately $0.1377/kWh.
