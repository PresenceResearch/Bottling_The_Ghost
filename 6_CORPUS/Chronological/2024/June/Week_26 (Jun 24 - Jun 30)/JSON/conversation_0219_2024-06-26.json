            "Sure, this is a comprehensive request. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n### Data Preparation\n\n1. **Sort the data by metro area (county)**.\n2. **Extract and calculate metrics:**\n   - Number of leads.\n   - Conversion rate of leads.\n   - Number of opportunities.\n   - Closed categories by percentage by metro area.\n   - Number of Closed Won.\n   - Type of financing.\n   - Average deal size (kW and $$).\n   - Average GM per deal (% and/or $).\n   - % of overall installs in the municipality (market share).\n   - Lumina system sizes compared to average.\n   - Financing types compared by average.\n   - Average system size, price, and GM per financing type.\n   - Breakdown of Closed/Lost by municipality.\n   - Competitor analysis (if data is available).\n\n### Analysis and Visualization\n\n1. **Leads and Opportunities:**\n   - Number of leads by metro area.\n   - Conversion rate of leads to opportunities.\n   \n2. **Sales Metrics:**\n   - Opportunities and closed categories (percentage breakdown).\n   - Closed Won numbers.\n   - Analysis of financing types and their impact on deal size and GM.\n   \n3. **Market Share:**\n   - Overall installs and Lumina\u2019s market share by municipality.\n   - Comparison of Lumina system sizes with the average.\n   \n4. **Competitor Analysis:**\n   - Comparison of Lumina installs with competitor installs.\n   - Ratio of Lumina to competitor losses.\n   - Analysis of unresponsives extrapolated to potential competitor losses.\n   \n5. **Socioeconomic Analysis:**\n   - Layer sales data with census data (e.g., median household income).\n   - GM analysis in richer vs. less affluent areas.\n   \n6. **Product and County Performance:**\n   - Determine the most profitable product by county.\n   - Customer acquisition cost per county and deal type.\n   \n7. **Marketing Analysis:**\n   - $/Watt marketing vs. $/Watt installed.\n   - Historical yield from increased marketing spend.\n   \n8. **County Characteristic Analysis:**\n   - Identify counties with similar characteristics and apply Lumina\u2019s cost structure.\n   - Adjust GM per mile of extra drive time.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Data Loading:**\n   - Load the salesforce data and any other relevant datasets.\n   \n2. **Data Cleaning and Sorting:**\n   - Ensure data consistency and sort by county.\n\n3. **Metric Calculation:**\n   - Compute the required metrics for each category.\n\n4. **Data Integration:**\n   - Integrate census data with salesforce data.\n   \n5. **Visualization:**\n   - Create visualizations for each metric using appropriate charts and graphs.\n\n6. **Analysis Report:**\n   - Compile the findings into a comprehensive report.\n\n### Visualization Examples\n\n1. **Number of Leads and Conversion Rates by Metro Area:**\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Assuming salesforce_data is a DataFrame with the required data\n   # Group data by metro area and calculate metrics\n   metro_data = salesforce_data.groupby('MetroArea').agg({\n       'Leads': 'sum',\n       'Opportunities': 'sum',\n       'ClosedWon': 'sum',\n       'TotalDealSize': 'sum',\n       'TotalGM': 'sum'\n   }).reset_index()\n\n   # Calculate conversion rate\n   metro_data['ConversionRate'] = metro_data['Opportunities'] / metro_data['Leads'] * 100\n\n   # Plotting the number of leads\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n   plt.bar(metro_data['MetroArea'], metro_data['Leads'], color='blue')\n   plt.xlabel('Metro Area')\n   plt.ylabel('Number of Leads')\n   plt.title('Number of Leads by Metro Area')\n   plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n   plt.show()\n\n   # Plotting the conversion rate\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n   plt.bar(metro_data['MetroArea'], metro_data['ConversionRate'], color='green')\n   plt.xlabel('Metro Area')\n   plt.ylabel('Conversion Rate (%)')\n   plt.title('Conversion Rate by Metro Area')\n   plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n2. **Closed Won Analysis by Financing Type:**\n   ```python\n   # Assuming financing_data is a DataFrame with the required data\n   # Group data by financing type and calculate metrics\n   financing_data = salesforce_data.groupby('FinancingType').agg({\n       'ClosedWon': 'sum',\n       'TotalDealSize': 'mean',\n       'TotalGM': 'mean'\n   }).reset_index()\n\n   # Plotting closed won by financing type\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n   plt.bar(financing_data['FinancingType'], financing_data['ClosedWon'], color='orange')\n   plt.xlabel('Financing Type')\n   plt.ylabel('Number of Closed Won Deals')\n   plt.title('Closed Won Deals by Financing Type')\n   plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n3. **Market Share Analysis:**\n   ```python\n   # Assuming market_share_data is a DataFrame with the required data\n   # Calculate market share\n   market_share_data['MarketShare'] = market_share_data['LuminaInstalls'] / market_share_data['TotalInstalls'] * 100\n\n   # Plotting market share by municipality\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n   plt.bar(market_share_data['Municipality'], market_share_data['MarketShare'], color='purple')\n   plt.xlabel('Municipality')\n   plt.ylabel('Market Share (%)')\n   plt.title('Market Share by Municipality')\n   plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Provide the salesforce data** (and any other relevant datasets).\n2. **Specify any particular focus areas** or additional metrics that need emphasis.\n3. **Discuss the report format** and preferred visualization styles.\n\nOnce the data is provided, I can start processing and creating the required visualizations and analysis report."
