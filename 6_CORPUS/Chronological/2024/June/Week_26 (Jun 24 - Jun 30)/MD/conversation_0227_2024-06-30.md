To factory reset a Chromebook, follow these steps:

1. **Back Up Your Data**: Before resetting, ensure all important data is backed up, as a factory reset will erase all the information on your Chromebook.

2. **Sign Out of Your Google Account**:
   - Click on your account photo in the lower-right corner of the screen.
   - Click "Sign out."

3. **Open the Settings Menu**:
   - Click on the clock in the lower-right corner.
   - Click the gear icon to open the Settings menu.

4. **Reset Your Chromebook**:
   - Scroll down and click "Advanced" to expand the advanced settings.
   - Scroll down to the "Reset settings" section.
   - Click "Reset" next to "Powerwash."
   - In the pop-up dialog, click "Restart."

5. **Confirm the Reset**:
   - Your Chromebook will restart and prompt you to confirm the reset. Click "Powerwash" and then "Continue."

6. **Sign In**: After the reset, your Chromebook will restart and you will be prompted to sign in with your Google account.

Once the reset process is complete, your Chromebook will be restored to its original factory settings.

If you don't see the gear icon after signing out, you can try an alternative method to factory reset your Chromebook:

1. **Turn Off Your Chromebook**: Press and hold the power button until the device shuts down.

2. **Enter Recovery Mode**:
   - Press and hold the `Esc` key and the `Refresh` key (which looks like a circular arrow) simultaneously, then press the power button.
   - Release the power button once the Chromebook turns on, but keep holding the `Esc` and `Refresh` keys until you see the recovery screen.

3. **Initiate the Reset**:
   - When you see the recovery screen with the message "Chrome OS is missing or damaged," press `Ctrl + D`.
   - At the next screen, press `Enter` to turn off OS verification.
   - Your Chromebook will reboot, and you will see another screen prompting you to press the space bar to re-enable OS verification. Press the space bar, then press `Enter` to confirm.

4. **Complete the Reset**: Your Chromebook will reboot again, and this time it will perform a factory reset. Once it's done, you will be taken to the initial setup screen where you can sign in with your Google account.

This method should reset your Chromebook to its factory settings.
