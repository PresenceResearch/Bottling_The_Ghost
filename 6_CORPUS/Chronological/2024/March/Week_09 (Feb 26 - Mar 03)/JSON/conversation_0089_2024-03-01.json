It\u2019s easier than you think. There are many ways to earn money as a consultant: \u301014\u2020social media consulting\u3011, \u301015\u2020IT consulting\u3011, \u301016\u2020home staging consulting\u3011, \u301017\u2020environmental consulting\u3011 and \u301018\u2020much more\u3011.\n\nStart by doing an \u301019\u2020inventory of your skills and experience\u3011.

Either way, it\u2019s important to focus on how to earn money as a consultant. No matter how much you love your work, work is work.\n\nMany consultants choose to \u301022\u2020earn money on a per-project basis\u3011 rather than an hourly rate.

Being a consultant involves a lot of \u301023\u2020perks\u3011, but it also involves hard work and risk. Your hourly wage should and can reflect this.

It\u2019s easier than you think. There are many ways to earn money as a consultant: \u301014\u2020social media consulting\u3011, \u301015\u2020IT consulting\u3011, \u301016\u2020home staging consulting\u3011, \u301017\u2020environmental consulting\u3011 and \u301018\u2020much more\u3011.\n\nStart by doing an \u301019\u2020inventory of your skills and experience\u3011.

Either way, it\u2019s important to focus on how to earn money as a consultant. No matter how much you love your work, work is work.\n\nMany consultants choose to \u301022\u2020earn money on a per-project basis\u3011 rather than an hourly rate.

Being a consultant involves a lot of \u301023\u2020perks\u3011, but it also involves hard work and risk. Your hourly wage should and can reflect this.

Pick up freelance work online\n\n[Image 3]\n\nMake money online through websites such as Upwork, Fiverr and Freelancer.com. These sites offer opportunities to do a variety of freelance jobs, such as writing, programming, design, marketing, data entry and being a \u3010245\u2020virtual assistant\u3011. Fluent in a second language? Check sites such as Gengo or Blend Express, or drum up business through a site of your own. No matter what freelancing you do, keep track of the going rate for the kind of work you provide so you know what to charge. \u3010246\u2020Learn how to get started on Upwork\u3011.\n\nA recent report from Freelancer.com found that creative writing jobs had the fastest growth in listings on its site in the second quarter of 2023, up 58%. And although generative artificial intelligence (AI) is being used more for content creation, it can\u2019t fully do the work of human writers. Companies are looking for writers who know how to edit AI content and who have at least a basic understanding of search engine optimization \u2014 learning or beefing up SEO skills could be a lucrative side hustle. Some freelancers are charging $100 an hour or more for their freelance writing services.\n\nTotal time: It can take a while to get your first gig. Setup: 24-48 hours. How easy to start: Easy, if you have the expertise. How fast you'll get paid: Varies by site.\n\nNeed to know \n\n  * It takes Upwork up to 48 hours to approve your profile. But keep in mind it can take time to land your first freelance gig.\n\n  * Payment varies by site. On Upwork the timeline for receiving earnings depends on the type of payment. Hourly contracts have a weekly billing cycle and you can withdraw funds 10 days later. Fixed-price contracts have a five-day waiting period. Project catalog contracts allow payment withdrawal after five days. And bonus payments also become available after five days. In each case, a client has to review your work. On Fiverr, you're paid when the work order is complete, but you can't withdraw funds for 14 days. (The waiting time is shorter for those in the Top Rated Sellers and Fiverr Studio Member ranks.)\n\nRequirements \n\n  * Upwork and Fivver require users to be at least 18 to sell work. And Freelancer.com requires users to be at least 16.\n\n  * Some sites require you to be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.\n\nBack to top \n\nMoney management made easy \n\nNerdWallet tracks your income, bills, and shows you ways to save more. \n\n\u3010247\u2020SIGN UP\u3011\n\n[Image 4]\n\n### 2. Test websites and apps \n\nAnother way to make money from home is on sites like UserTesting.com. You get paid for your thoughts on how well \u2014 or not so well \u2014 certain websites and apps work. You\u2019ll have to complete a short test to be accepted, then you\u2019ll be paid depending on the test type. \n\nTotal time: Approval time can vary. Setup: Less than an hour. How easy to start: Easy, if you have the tech gear and complete a sample test. Age threshold: 18+. How fast you'll get paid: 14 days.\n\nNeed to know \n\n  * You need to complete a sample test as part of the application process.\n\n  * You will start receiving testing opportunities after your application is approved.\n\n  * The timeline for approval can vary.\n\n  * Payment amounts vary based on the length of the tests. You get paid 14 days after completing a website or app test via PayPal.\n\nRequirements \n\n  * You need to be at least 18.\n\n  * You need a computer, internet connection and microphone.\n\n  * Mobile app testers also need an Android or iOS mobile phone or tablet.\n\n  * The practice test and most user testing requires English, German or French; some test opportunities may be in additional languages.\n\nBack to top \n\n### 3. Learn to use AI tools \n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence is on the rise. A recent report from PwC estimates that the North American economy will see a $3.7 trillion impact by 2030, thanks to the AI market. \n\nSo there\u2019s no better time to learn how to make money by using AI tools. Some AI-related side hustles include:\n\n  * Integrating AI tools as a freelancer, to help you create digital products or to edit AI content for a client.\n\n  * Improving your advertising, marketing efforts and management of your existing small business.\n\n  * Teaching others to use AI tools.\n\nTotal time: Depends on demand.

Age threshold: 16+ for Freelancer.com and 18 for Upwork.

Pick up freelance work online\n\n[Image 3]\n\nMake money online through websites such as Upwork, Fiverr and Freelancer.com. These sites offer opportunities to do a variety of freelance jobs, such as writing, programming, design, marketing, data entry and being a \u3010245\u2020virtual assistant\u3011. Fluent in a second language? Check sites such as Gengo or Blend Express, or drum up business through a site of your own. No matter what freelancing you do, keep track of the going rate for the kind of work you provide so you know what to charge. \u3010246\u2020Learn how to get started on Upwork\u3011.\n\nA recent report from Freelancer.com found that creative writing jobs had the fastest growth in listings on its site in the second quarter of 2023, up 58%. And although generative artificial intelligence (AI) is being used more for content creation, it can\u2019t fully do the work of human writers. Companies are looking for writers who know how to edit AI content and who have at least a basic understanding of search engine optimization \u2014 learning or beefing up SEO skills could be a lucrative side hustle. Some freelancers are charging $100 an hour or more for their freelance writing services.\n\nTotal time: It can take a while to get your first gig. Setup: 24-48 hours. How easy to start: Easy, if you have the expertise. How fast you'll get paid: Varies by site.\n\nNeed to know \n\n  * It takes Upwork up to 48 hours to approve your profile. But keep in mind it can take time to land your first freelance gig.\n\n  * Payment varies by site. On Upwork the timeline for receiving earnings depends on the type of payment. Hourly contracts have a weekly billing cycle and you can withdraw funds 10 days later. Fixed-price contracts have a five-day waiting period. Project catalog contracts allow payment withdrawal after five days. And bonus payments also become available after five days. In each case, a client has to review your work. On Fiverr, you're paid when the work order is complete, but you can't withdraw funds for 14 days. (The waiting time is shorter for those in the Top Rated Sellers and Fiverr Studio Member ranks.)\n\nRequirements \n\n  * Upwork and Fivver require users to be at least 18 to sell work. And Freelancer.com requires users to be at least 16.\n\n  * Some sites require you to be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.\n\nBack to top \n\nMoney management made easy \n\nNerdWallet tracks your income, bills, and shows you ways to save more. \n\n\u3010247\u2020SIGN UP\u3011\n\n[Image 4]\n\n### 2. Test websites and apps \n\nAnother way to make money from home is on sites like UserTesting.com. You get paid for your thoughts on how well \u2014 or not so well \u2014 certain websites and apps work. You\u2019ll have to complete a short test to be accepted, then you\u2019ll be paid depending on the test type. \n\nTotal time: Approval time can vary. Setup: Less than an hour. How easy to start: Easy, if you have the tech gear and complete a sample test. Age threshold: 18+. How fast you'll get paid: 14 days.\n\nNeed to know \n\n  * You need to complete a sample test as part of the application process.\n\n  * You will start receiving testing opportunities after your application is approved.\n\n  * The timeline for approval can vary.\n\n  * Payment amounts vary based on the length of the tests. You get paid 14 days after completing a website or app test via PayPal.\n\nRequirements \n\n  * You need to be at least 18.\n\n  * You need a computer, internet connection and microphone.\n\n  * Mobile app testers also need an Android or iOS mobile phone or tablet.\n\n  * The practice test and most user testing requires English, German or French; some test opportunities may be in additional languages.\n\nBack to top \n\n### 3. Learn to use AI tools \n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence is on the rise. A recent report from PwC estimates that the North American economy will see a $3.7 trillion impact by 2030, thanks to the AI market. \n\nSo there\u2019s no better time to learn how to make money by using AI tools. Some AI-related side hustles include:\n\n  * Integrating AI tools as a freelancer, to help you create digital products or to edit AI content for a client.\n\n  * Improving your advertising, marketing efforts and management of your existing small business.\n\n  * Teaching others to use AI tools.\n\nTotal time: Depends on demand. Setup: Around 24-48 hours if using a site like Upwork or Freelancer.com. How easy to start: \u00a0If you\u2019re already familiar with AI tools, it will be easier to get started. Age threshold: 16+ for Freelancer.com and 18 for Upwork. How fast you'll get paid: Varies by client or the number of products you sell and your chosen platform.\n\nNeed to know \n\n  * Give yourself time to get familiar",

As a result, there is a strong demand for qualified instructors who are well versed in English and have the patience and skillset to work with others.\n\nThe requirements for teaching online courses in English tend to vary depending on which site you use. However, as a rule of thumb, you should have teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) certification, a bachelor\u2019s degree, and a fast computer with a reliable internet connection for video chatting and exchanging media with students.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley, look into a site like VIPKid, Preply, or English First. Or, consider launching your own business by starting a website, launching a YouTube channel, or connecting with people on social media.\n\nLearn More:\n\n  * Read our \u301043\u2020full review of VIPKid\u3011.\n\n### 7. Sell unwanted tech \n\nWhen is the last time you swept through your house and cleaned out your unwanted technical devices? If you\u2019re like most people, it\u2019s probably been a while.\n\nTake a look around your house and round up all of your unwanted smartphones, DVDs, laptops, CDs, televisions, tablets, Bluetooth speakers, headphones, cameras \u2014 the list goes on. Then head over to a site like Decluttr and consider selling your unwanted items.\n\nDecluttr will pay you money for your unwanted devices and media. They\u2019ll even pay for shipping and send you a box, which makes it incredibly easy.\n\nAs an added bonus, Decluttr also takes unwanted toys and games, too. You should also look into selling items on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or LetGo. If you\u2019ve got a lot of stuff to get rid of, there are many other \u301044\u2020selling apps\u3011 to explore.\n\nOnce you sell your unwanted materials, you can put your money in the bank to save or invest. You can also consider looking for bargain items or junk online that you can potentially flip for a profit.\n\n### 8. Use Amazon to make money \n\nPrime is just one of the many services that Amazon is known for. As it turns out, the company has a variety of business services that you can use to bring in extra income on the side.\n\n  * Amazon Handmade: Amazon Handmade is a service that lets you sell handmade items like potholders, t-shirts, drawings, and hats. If you\u2019re creative and enjoy making items in your spare time, consider selling them on Amazon Handmade. It\u2019s sort of like Etsy. Just on Amazon. \n  * Merch by Amazon: If you like working as a graphic designer but don\u2019t want to deal with the pain of managing and selling inventory, check out Merch by Amazon. This service lets you upload your own unique design, add a product description, and connect with buyers. When someone buys your design, you can receive a cut of the sale. It\u2019s that simple. \n  * AWS: Organizations of all sizes are moving to the cloud these days. However, many lack experience managing Amazon Web Services, which is Amazon\u2019s flagship cloud offering. If you\u2019re a tech whiz, consider offering AWS consulting services through this program by helping organizations migrate to the cloud efficiently and securely.\n\nLearn More:\n\n  * Read our in-depth article on the \u301045\u2020Best Ways to Make Money on Amazon\u3011\n\n### 9. Proofread \n\nIf you enjoy reading and learning about new things, imagine if you could get paid to do both. Truth be told, you can. You just need to get a proofreading job.\n\nCompanies that produce a lot of content are often looking for freelance proofreaders and will pay people like you to read and edit material before it goes to print.\n\nYou can get paid to look for spelling and grammar mistakes, to check for accuracy, or check whether content aligns with corporate style guides and policies, among other things.\n\nProofreading is a fun and flexible job. And if you\u2019re good at it \u2014 meaning nothing gets by you and you can turn around copy fast \u2014 it can lead to more work, in other fields even.\n\nLearn More:\n\n  * \u301046\u2020Best Online Proofreading Jobs (Make up to $100/hr)\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020Get Paid to Read Books\u3011\n\n### 10. Data Entry \n\nCan you sit in front of a computer for hours on end and enter data into spreadsheets? If that sounds like your idea of fun, data entry may just be for you.\n\nDespite all of the advancements in workflow automation, data entry remains a top demand for companies of all sizes. You can get paid to transcribe information from invoices, field reports, customer reviews, and countless other documents.\n\nJust like with proofreading, data entry requires patience and an impeccable eye for detail.\n\nOne of the great things about data entry is that companies who hire for this position typically have a steady need for it. For example, think of a busy healthcare company that needs to quickly process patient assessments or a busy product manufacturer that needs to fill orders and transmit them for billing.\n\nIf you get your foot in the door, it could lead to steady income.\n\n### 11. Review music \n\nWhat\u2019s better than getting paid to listen to new music and write about it?\n\nIf you have an ear for music like P. Diddy or Taylor Swift and you\u2019re good at writing, check out sites like Music Xray. It\u2019s a site that lets emerging singers and songwriters submit their songs for review, and earn cash rewards for listening to music.\n\nAs a user, you can get paid to listen to new music from amateurs. Clips are half a minute in length and you can cash out when your account reaches $20 via PayPal.\n\nMusic aficionados are hard-pressed to find a better gig.\n\n### 12. Become an online personal trainer \n\nThe pandemic has taken its toll on global waistlines.\n\nAccording to one study by WebMD, 47% of women said they gained weight due to COVID-19 restrictions, while 22% of men packed on pounds, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fitness guru, why not capitalize on this demand and host an online fitness class? You might want to teach yoga or stretching exercises. You can also host a live cardio event or virtual spin class for attendees \u2014 charging them a fee and \u301048\u2020collecting payments\u3011 through a service like Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal.\n\nIn addition to making some extra money, this is a great way to stay in shape and encourage others to be healthier and shake off their pandemic rut.\n\n### 13. Get paid to lose weight \n\nIf you\u2019re the one who is looking to shed a few pounds, here\u2019s some incredible news: You can actually get paid to lose weight.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Head over to HealthyWage and check out their weight-loss competitions.\n\nThis site basically lets you bet against yourself and set target weight loss goals. You can do it solo, with a group, and even with coworkers.\n\n### 14. Host an online cooking class \n\nIf English journalist James May taught us one thing in his hit cooking show \u201cOh Cook,\u201d it\u2019s that you don\u2019t have to be a professional chef to be great in the kitchen \u2014 or on camera.\n\nAll you need to do is have some personality and a genuine curiosity about how to make different recipes.\n\nBust out your cooking supplies, dig up some fun recipes (or make some up), and start a YouTube channel. Before you know it, you could be the next James May.\n\nAs a side note, this could be a fun activity for people who are home alone during the pandemic with nobody to cook for \u2014 especially if you turn into a live stream.\n\nIf you do a few episodes and they\u2019re a hit, ask for donations or consider working with a local restaurant or food provider who may want to sponsor the series.\n\n### 15. Write dating profiles \n\nAsk anyone who\u2019s ever done it and they\u2019ll tell you the same thing: Spend some time swiping through online dating profiles, and you\u2019re bound to cringe on more than one occasion.\n\nThe truth is there are a lot of bad dating profiles out there. And there\u2019s an art to crafting the perfect dating profile, and some people are willing to pay for it. If you\u2019re good at this type of activity, why not take a stab at it?\n\nOne way to make money writing dating profiles is to go through a company like \u301049\u2020Vida\u2020www.vidaselect.com\u3011, which hires remote workers for this specific activity. Another option is to advertise your services on message boards or by word of mouth.\n\nIf you are effective at this type of writing, you could potentially help someone find true love and start a family. It\u2019s work that you can feel good about doing.\n\n### 16. Be a virtual recruiter \n\nLet\u2019s say you have a knack for striking up a conversation and a deep network of connections on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Put these skills to use and launch a \u301050\u2020side gig\u3011 as a virtual recruiter.\n\nVirtual recruiters connect talented individuals with corporations \u2014 posting jobs, screening workers, and passing talented matches along to hiring managers for further interviewing.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an industry expert on a particular topic. All you have to do is have an eye for talent and an ability to ask the right questions.\n\nThis can be a great way to make money on your own time while also helping others by furthering their careers.\n\n### 17. Transcribe audio \n\nRecent advancements in audio transcription technology make it much faster and easier to transcribe audio. However, they are not 100% effective yet. The technology still struggles with spelling and grammar \u2014 and with voice recognition, too.\n\nAs such, there is still strong demand for audio transcription support. You can get paid to either transcribe audio from a recording or to run through transcriptions and edit them for proper formatting, accuracy, style, and clarity.\n\nThis job requires patience and above-average listening skills. It also helps if you are good at understanding different accents and dialects.\n\nFo",

This service lets you upload your own unique design, add a product description, and connect with buyers. When someone buys your design, you can receive a cut of the sale. It\u2019s that simple. \n  * AWS: Organizations of all sizes are moving to the cloud these days. However, many lack experience managing Amazon Web Services, which is Amazon\u2019s flagship cloud offering. If you\u2019re a tech whiz, consider offering AWS consulting services through this program by helping organizations migrate to the cloud efficiently and securely.\n\nLearn More:\n\n  * Read our in-depth article on the \u301045\u2020Best Ways to Make Money on Amazon\u3011\n\n### 9. Proofread \n\nIf you enjoy reading and learning about new things, imagine if you could get paid to do both. Truth be told, you can. You just need to get a proofreading job.\n\nCompanies that produce a lot of content are often looking for freelance proofreaders and will pay people like you to read and edit material before it goes to print.\n\nYou can get paid to look for spelling and grammar mistakes, to check for accuracy, or check whether content aligns with corporate style guides and policies, among other things.\n\nProofreading is a fun and flexible job. And if you\u2019re good at it \u2014 meaning nothing gets by you and you can turn around copy fast \u2014 it can lead to more work, in other fields even.\n\nLearn More:\n\n  * \u301046\u2020Best Online Proofreading Jobs (Make up to $100/hr)\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020Get Paid to Read Books\u3011\n\n### 10. Data Entry \n\nCan you sit in front of a computer for hours on end and enter data into spreadsheets? If that sounds like your idea of fun, data entry may just be for you.\n\nDespite all of the advancements in workflow automation, data entry remains a top demand for companies of all sizes. You can get paid to transcribe information from invoices, field reports, customer reviews, and countless other documents.\n\nJust like with proofreading, data entry requires patience and an impeccable eye for detail.\n\nOne of the great things about data entry is that companies who hire for this position typically have a steady need for it. For example, think of a busy healthcare company that needs to quickly process patient assessments or a busy product manufacturer that needs to fill orders and transmit them for billing.\n\nIf you get your foot in the door, it could lead to steady income.\n\n### 11. Review music \n\nWhat\u2019s better than getting paid to listen to new music and write about it?\n\nIf you have an ear for music like P. Diddy or Taylor Swift and you\u2019re good at writing, check out sites like Music Xray. It\u2019s a site that lets emerging singers and songwriters submit their songs for review, and earn cash rewards for listening to music.\n\nAs a user, you can get paid to listen to new music from amateurs. Clips are half a minute in length and you can cash out when your account reaches $20 via PayPal.\n\nMusic aficionados are hard-pressed to find a better gig.\n\n### 12. Become an online personal trainer \n\nThe pandemic has taken its toll on global waistlines.\n\nAccording to one study by WebMD, 47% of women said they gained weight due to COVID-19 restrictions, while 22% of men packed on pounds, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fitness guru, why not capitalize on this demand and host an online fitness class? You might want to teach yoga or stretching exercises. You can also host a live cardio event or virtual spin class for attendees \u2014 charging them a fee and \u301048\u2020collecting payments\u3011 through a service like Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal.\n\nIn addition to making some extra money, this is a great way to stay in shape and encourage others to be healthier and shake off their pandemic rut.\n\n### 13. Get paid to lose weight \n\nIf you\u2019re the one who is looking to shed a few pounds, here\u2019s some incredible news: You can actually get paid to lose weight.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Head over to HealthyWage and check out their weight-loss competitions.\n\nThis site basically lets you bet against yourself and set target weight loss goals. You can do it solo, with a group, and even with coworkers.\n\n### 14. Host an online cooking class \n\nIf English journalist James May taught us one thing in his hit cooking show \u201cOh Cook,\u201d it\u2019s that you don\u2019t have to be a professional chef to be great in the kitchen \u2014 or on camera.\n\nAll you need to do is have some personality and a genuine curiosity about how to make different recipes.\n\nBust out your cooking supplies, dig up some fun recipes (or make some up), and start a YouTube channel. Before you know it, you could be the next James May.\n\nAs a side note, this could be a fun activity for people who are home alone during the pandemic with nobody to cook for \u2014 especially if you turn into a live stream.\n\nIf you do a few episodes and they\u2019re a hit, ask for donations or consider working with a local restaurant or food provider who may want to sponsor the series.\n\n### 15. Write dating profiles \n\nAsk anyone who\u2019s ever done it and they\u2019ll tell you the same thing: Spend some time swiping through online dating profiles, and you\u2019re bound to cringe on more than one occasion.\n\nThe truth is there are a lot of bad dating profiles out there. And there\u2019s an art to crafting the perfect dating profile, and some people are willing to pay for it. If you\u2019re good at this type of activity, why not take a stab at it?\n\nOne way to make money writing dating profiles is to go through a company like \u301049\u2020Vida\u2020www.vidaselect.com\u3011, which hires remote workers for this specific activity. Another option is to advertise your services on message boards or by word of mouth.\n\nIf you are effective at this type of writing, you could potentially help someone find true love and start a family. It\u2019s work that you can feel good about doing.\n\n### 16. Be a virtual recruiter \n\nLet\u2019s say you have a knack for striking up a conversation and a deep network of connections on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Put these skills to use and launch a \u301050\u2020side gig\u3011 as a virtual recruiter.\n\nVirtual recruiters connect talented individuals with corporations \u2014 posting jobs, screening workers, and passing talented matches along to hiring managers for further interviewing.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an industry expert on a particular topic. All you have to do is have an eye for talent and an ability to ask the right questions.\n\nThis can be a great way to make money on your own time while also helping others by furthering their careers.\n\n### 17. Transcribe audio \n\nRecent advancements in audio transcription technology make it much faster and easier to transcribe audio. However, they are not 100% effective yet. The technology still struggles with spelling and grammar \u2014 and with voice recognition, too.\n\nAs such, there is still strong demand for audio transcription support. You can get paid to either transcribe audio from a recording or to run through transcriptions and edit them for proper formatting, accuracy, style, and clarity.\n\nThis job requires patience and above-average listening skills. It also helps if you are good at understanding different accents and dialects.\n\nFo",

It\u2019s worth pointing out that investors will rarely, if ever, ask for your thoughts on the share price.\u00a0It\u2019s their job to evaluate that.\n\n#### #2 \u2013 The Industry Overview\n\nInvestors may kick off their research by speaking with a few experts.\u00a0They often come into these paid consulting calls without much foundation, which can make these calls a cakewalk; you get to play the role of star professor while they lap up your every word.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese calls tend to dive down into who the major customers and suppliers are in your market segment, what the economics look like, and where the industry is headed.\u00a0Things will generally shift to your opinion on the leaders or breakout companies, and if there\u2019s an upstart product or technology, they\u2019ll want your perspective on how that may impact the industry.\u00a0\n\nYou may be asked for your quick take on several companies during a lightning round. But more frequently they\u2019ll want to know, \u201cwhat questions should we be asking?\u201d as they will be talking to others.\n\n#### #3 \u2013 Consulting to Consultants\n\nWhile investment firms are the largest client category for expert networks, management consultants are increasingly using expert calls to sharpen their insights.\u00a0Consulting firms are typically helping their clients launch a new product or business-line, improve the performance of one that is misfiring, or perform due diligence as part of an investment or acquisition.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese calls tend to revolve more around how things work, such as your process for evaluating a product or service that your company has recently purchased, or if a new product with certain features would be something you\u2019d consider using.\u00a0\n\nAgain, these calls are easy because clients will hang on your every word while happily paying you top dollar for your opinions (which they probably bill at 2X to their clients. ????)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n#### Expert Network Surveys\n\n[Image 3: Post boasting about a high number of GLG survey requests]\n\nMany expert networks also regularly conduct surveys on behalf of their clients. These tend to revolve around your perception of a set of products or what your expectations are for a market in the near future, such as if you expect your budget to grow, shrink or stay about the same and how you\u2019ll allocate it over the next year.\n\nThese invitation-only surveys generally take 10 \u2013 20 minutes to complete online and pay a fixed rate, that usually falls between $40 \u2013 $80. While they\u2019re generally not as lucrative as completing calls, they are an easy way to make a few extra bucks in your spare time. \n\n## How to Get Started with Expert Networks\n\n[Image 4: GLG consulting request LinkedIn]Expert networks like GLG heavily recruit new consultants via LinkedIn message about consulting opportunities.\n\nOne of the best parts of expert network consulting is there are opportunities for practically any professional. \n\nC-level executives charging over $1,000 per consulting call tend to get the headlines, but bread-and-butter projects go to upper and mid-level managers (you know, the people who actually DO stuff) in virtually any field: \n\n  * sales\n\n  * marketing\n  * finance\n  * manufacturing\n\n  * operations\n  * human resources\n  * strategy\n\n  * and more\n\nAnd that\u2019s not mentioning the countless projects in areas beyond business. Engineers, construction managers, small business owners, farmers, and former government officials are often in demand. \u30106\u2020Healthcare also comprises a meaningful chunk of the expert network industry\u3011, with a high volume of projects available to doctors, nurses, pharmacists, back office administrators, and veterinarians. \n\nReady to get started with expert networks? Here are your first steps mapped out.\n\n#### Step #1 \u2013 Get found\n\nExpert networks employ small armies of recent college graduates tasked with finding people who have the firsthand knowledge their clients are looking for on a project (AlphaSights ranks as one of the top 25 employers of new college grads!). \n\nThese associates spend much of their day trolling LinkedIn and looking for profiles that match up well with their project descriptions. They typically don\u2019t know much about the subject of the project itself; they\u2019re just trying to find people who match the requirements. (You may have found this page by doing some Googling about a paid consulting opportunity you received via a LinkedIn message!) Make it easy for them to connect with you on LinkinedIn by opening up the \u301044\u2020messaging settings\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 on your and/or including your email address in the Contact Info section of your profile.\n\n>>> \u301043\u2020Click here to register as a GLG Council Member and start receiving project opportunities.\u2020membership.glgresearch.com\u3011\n\n#### Step #2 \u2013 Optimize your LinkedIn profile\n\nStart by adding a descriptive and keyword-rich list of companies, products and industries to your profile (these should be subjects you can knowledgeably talk about). This will help your profile pop to the top of more keyword-driven searches. A good rule of thumb is if you could give a half hour presentation on a topic, you may be an expert in it. \n\nBe sure to list out former employers, vendors you closely work with, software and products you use regularly in your job, and close competitors you frequently butt heads with. Be specific about what your role entails, especially if you share the same title with dozens or hundreds of other people at the same organization (such as \u2018program manager\u2019 or \u2018vice president\u2019). If you own a budget or are the final decision maker on large purchase decisions, call that out directly as well. \n\nAssociates may scan through hundreds of profiles a day, so make it easy for them to see that you closely match the requirements in their project spec.\n\nLooking to fast-track your visibility? Read our insider tips on how to spruce up your \u301011\u2020LinkedIn profile for expert networks\u3011\n\n#### Step #3 \u2013 Register with expert network companies\n\nOnce your LinkedIn profile is shipshape, the next step is to invest a few hours creating profiles directly with expert networks. \n\nThere are several hundred expert networks around the world, many of which are strong in certain geographies or industries and could be a great source of projects for you. However, \u201cThe Big Five\u201d firms are a good place to start:\n\n  * \u301024\u2020Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG)\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020AlphaSights\u2020www.alphasights.com\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Guidepoint Global\u3011\n\n  * \u301035\u2020Third Bridge\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Coleman Research\u3011\n\n(If you are especially interested in completing expert network surveys that generally pay $40 \u2013 $70, you should also register with up-and-coming networks like \u301018\u2020Atheneum\u3011, \u301022\u2020Dialectica\u3011, \u301027\u2020Maven Research\u3011, \u301030\u2020proSapient\u3011, \u301033\u2020techspert.io\u3011, and \u301046\u2020NewtonX\u2020www.newtonx.com\u3011.)\n\nYour expert network profile should look different than your resume or what you post on LinkedIn. Expert networks are interested in what you know, not what you can do, so omit the soft skills you typically list elsewhere. Your goals here are to show up near the top of the list in relevant search results and quickly convince an associate you match up well enough to their spec to earn an invitation to apply to their project. Associates will typically spend about 10 seconds scanning your profile, so make it SIMPLE AND EASY for them to find what they are looking for.\n\nRemember, most of the time associates know little (or nothing) about the subject matter of the project itself \u2013 they only know the qualifications the client is looking for. Those are the terms they are putting in the search query field, and those are the words or names they look for when they scan your profile. \n\nIt may only take a few keywords to land a project invite, so list out everything you are qualified to speak about in clear and organized lists. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a seasoned veteran in the sugary cereal business. \n\nYou would create detailed, cut-through keyword lists like this:\n\n  * I am an expert on cereal marketing, cereal product development, cereal pricing and promotion, food packaging design, and character licensing.\n  * I have five years of experience as a brand manager for General Mills monster cereals: Count Chocula, Boo Berry and Franken Berry.\n\n  * I compete directly with Kellogg\u2019s Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, and Coco Pops.\n  * I manage the $X million Got Milk cross-promotion and am a customer of Advertising Agency X, Marketing Agency Y, and Fulfillment Company Z.\n\nAlso, use an extremely direct headline or summary sentence to describe yourself. While you may have great success on LinkedIn by branding yourself with something clever like \u201cHelping America love breakfast\u201d, you don\u2019t want to beat around the bush in your expert network profiles and should make a beeline for a clearer description like \u201cBreakfast Cereal Brand Manager at General Mills\u201d.\n\nLooking to create an eye-catching expert network profile?

The Tegus answer is to employ a different business model, reminiscent of a cross between Costco and a library.\n\nIn the Tegus business model, the investor (buyer) pays a membership fee to have access to all of the expert interviews on the platform, which are shared/contributory, not proprietary.\u00a0 Buyers can also ask follow-up questions on existing interviews.\u00a0 When a buyer wants a new interview they pay the cost of the interview plus a flat per interview fee.\u00a0 Each interview is anonymized, compliance-checked, recorded and transcribed, and presumably, after some delay, put on the platform to be shared with others.\u00a0 It appears that investors can also pay a premium to further delay the public posting of the interview.\n\nI think there is some real genius in this model:\n\n  * It\u2019s a more \u201ctrue\u201d subscription model\n  * Pricing is transparent\n  * Compliance is a whole lot more transparent\n  * And the time delay, plus an additional premium for more time delay, is pure pricing genius.\n\n(Note:\u00a0 some expert networks have had surveys, reports, and even transcripted interviews they commissioned themselves in a library, what\u2019s really new here is the contributory/shared model.)\n\n# Tegus Disruption\n\nThe market appears to like the Tegus approach.\u00a0 \u00a0According to LinkedIn, Tegus has 426 employees.\u00a0 At $200k in revenue per employee (a significant discount to GLG and AlphaSights which have $280k and $290k in revenue per employee respectively), Tegus is coming up on $100 million in annual revenue.\u00a0 A cursory glance at the market suggests Tegus is now in the fifth position.\u00a0 Tegus has achieved this, despite the other networks having a 10-15 year head start in a market that might have appeared to have\u00a0 \u201cwinner-take-most\u201d dynamics.\u00a0 Some of the company\u2019s competitors are adopting aspects of their business model by offering comparable, shared libraries.\n\n# Tegus Origin Story\n\nTwin brothers started Tegus.\u00a0 One was at an investor and one was at AlphaSights.\u00a0 The brothers realized that with all of the multi-homing going on on both sides of the marketplace, a shared model might work better.

          "text": "\nWhen a client reaches out with a project, Third Bridge (and other networks) dive into their pool to find prospective advisors. The client selects the one they want to work with after asking questions and reviewing candidate proposals.\u00a0\n\nHow does Third Bridge make money from this transaction? The same way any middleman does; they charge a fee. In the case of expert networks, fees can be significant! Basically, an advisor sets their hourly consulting rate, then the expert network marks that rate up and keeps the difference.\u00a0\n\nLarge companies, startups, investors, and corporate consultants don\u2019t mind paying the markup in exchange for valuable strategic intel. Though it is not always possible to quantify the return on investment for such counsel, it\u2019s worth the money if they learn something that earns or saves them more than the consultation cost.\u00a0\n\n## What should you expect on a Third Bridge consulting call?\n\nSpeaking of costs, how much do Third Bridge specialists earn an hour, and what do they have to reveal on those calls? We\u2019ll get into rates in a little while, but let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s covered in an \u301010\u2020expert network project\u3011 call first.\u00a0\n\nCalls can be broadly categorized into one of three styles:\u00a0\n\nIndustry overview \u2014 Investors reach out to specialists to collect information they\u2019ll use to paint a \u201cbig picture\u201d that forecasts activity and informs decisions on investments or other strategic actions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompany deep dive \u2014 Deep dives are analytical, investigative explorations of target companies or a particular area within a company. Investors glean info on a company\u2019s growth potential or problems and respective consequences.\u00a0\n\nConsulting with consultants \u2014 Large companies have their own consultants (or contracted agencies), but it never hurts to reach out for additional objective insights.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge posts interviews with some of their specialists, such as Neil Farmer, founder of Farmer Associates. Neil describes his packaging and materials sector as a \u201cminefield to understand,\u201d saying he can \u201ctake people through what I know and share it with them so hopefully they can make good decisions, invest in companies, and grow the industry.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that expert networks exist to give companies an edge without breaking ethical guidelines or crossing legal boundaries. Advisors aren\u2019t allowed to disclose confidential or protected information. They must maintain strict standards during phone discussions. Failure to abide by Third Bridge\u2019s terms, or the terms set forth by the client, could result in dismissal from a project at a minimum. As noted on their \u301043\u2020webpage\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011, their \u201cstrict compliance framework is designed to protect our specialists and avoid the disclosure of confidential information, material nonpublic information, investment advice, and defamatory statements.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDig into our free, comprehensive \u301044\u2020Ultimate Expert Network Guide\u3011 to learn more secrets about high-paying consulting calls!\u00a0\n\n## Do I qualify as a subject matter expert?\u00a0\n\nAlas, the question everybody asks\u2014do I qualify? We can\u2019t answer that since we don\u2019t know you. But let\u2019s talk about what it takes to qualify as a \u201csubject matter expert\u201d in the first place. Have you ever worked for a specific industry or a specific company for an extended period? If so, did you not acquire hard-won knowledge that might potentially be useful for others to hear?\u00a0\n\nIf the answer is yes, chances are you qualify to work on projects related to your field or prior employers. The truth is, you don\u2019t have to determine whether you\u2019re qualified or not. Let Third Bridge do that for you. And if you\u2019re concerned you\u2019d be an \u201cimposter,\u201d we suggest you let somebody else worry about that, too! Apply and let them figure out if they could use you or not.\u00a0\n\n## How do I set my Third Bridge consulting rate?\n\nThis is another popular question we see a lot. If you\u2019ve ever gotten a LinkedIn message or seen an ad from an expert network, you probably noticed part of their \u201chook\u201d is to dangle promises of fat checks in front of you. An ad might read \u201cEarn hundreds of dollars an hour!\u201d but is that really possible?\u00a0\n\nYes, it is! Some consultants do earn hundreds of dollars an hour.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge and their peers want highly paid pros in their network. Why? Because the more your hourly rate is, the more they\u2019re going to mark it up. That\u2019s right; they aren\u2019t looking to onboard people who undervalue their potential. On the contrary, they\u2019re seeking advisors who demand a lot for their valuable time, experts able to talk the talk and walk the walk. If you can deliver the goods, set your rate accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get specific. If you worked in a specialized role or held a position of high authority, expect to charge more. Seasoned professionals and mid-level executives make $300 \u2013 $500 an hour in some cases.\u00a0\n\nIf you were more generalized or lower on the totem pole, that\u2019s okay; just understand your insights may carry less monetary value to the clients. Thus, you might set a rate between $100 \u2013 $150/hour with Third Bridge.\n\nWhat about you C-suite types out there? You know who you are, and if you see dollar signs floating over your eyes right now, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve realized you could monetize your knowledge for up to thousands of dollars\u2014per hour!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u301045\u2020Third Bridge\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011 \u201cidentifies and interprets the context, narrative, causality, connection, and meaning in data or events.\u201d Their clients are looking for \u201cthe signal in the noise,\u201d meaning they need high-end, value-rich insights and are willing to pay top dollar for them. The ROI is worth it if a piece of advice results in a million-dollar decision tilting in the right direction.\u00a0\n\nCheck out our detailed brief on \u30109\u2020how to price your consulting services\u3011 to learn more.\u00a0\n\n## What are the downsides to consulting for Third Bridge?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf there\u2019s such a thing as a downside to earning hundreds of dollars for an hour-long phone, then please let us know!\u00a0\n\nBut seriously, the biggest downside seems to be that work isn\u2019t consistent. Most projects Third Bridge receives from clients only require a short consultation. Even though they have many, many clients, you won\u2019t be selected for every relevant project (and even if you did, clients won\u2019t always select you based on your proposal).\u00a0\n\nSo, a typical complaint on Glassdoor goes something like this:\u00a0\n\n[Image 3]\n\nThird Bridge consulting projects are often sporadic, last just one hour and are thus pretty much the opposite of a full-time gig, and there are zero guarantees of work. Some consultants are getting steady projects; some might only get picked up occasionally. Either way, in all fairness, that isn\u2019t Third Bridge\u2019s fault. Their job is merely to provide an arena where clients and consultants can connect. Whether that connection happens depends a lot on your actions.\u00a0\n\nFor example, knowing that other advisors are vying for the same projects should motivate all applicants to put their best foot forward during the proposal process. If you whisk through a proposal and don\u2019t demonstrate your potential value to the client, that client is apt to pass you over and hire the person who spent a good 5 or 10 minutes answering screening questions cogently.\u00a0\n\nAgain, there\u2019s no promise you\u2019ll get selected even if you do spend ample time on the proposals, and that can be frustrating. All you can do is keep trying\u2026or give up. The people who are successful keep trying and get better over time.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest complaints seem to stem from either miscommunication or misunderstood expectations. Like other expert networks, Third Bridge prorates billing. You might set an \u201chourly\u201d rate but they pay per minute, so if your call is only 50 minutes, they don\u2019t pay for 60.\u00a0\n\nWhile that seems fair to us, not all Third Bridge consultants share the sentiment:\n\n[Image 4] [Image 5] [Image 6] [Image 7]\n\nWith a bit of clarity and expectation management upfront in regards to billing, specialists can come away feeling like they were paid correctly.\u00a0\n\n## How can I win more Third Bridge consulting projects?\n\nThe trick to winning projects is to a) be qualified and b) be persuasive and persistent. If either of those is missing, you\u2019ll find yourself on the \u201cfamine\u201d side of their \u201cfeast or famine\u201d environment.\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean to be qualified? In their tagline, Third Bridge is about \u201cHuman insights. Better investment decisions.\u201d Think of that as a filter. Will your insights lead to better investment decisions for clients or not? Keep in mind, \u201cbetter\u201d refers to how good their decisions would be without your input. They don\u2019t just want good advice; they want better than average, expert-level advice. They want to hear something they couldn\u2019t find off Google.\u00a0\n\nHow do you convince them you can provide that? Again, you have to be qualified and persuasive! It doesn\u2019t do any good to be qualified if you can\u2019t convey that to them in your proposal. And it won\u2019t help anyone if you apply to a gig you actually can\u2019t help with. In fact, that\u2019ll lead to disappointment during the call and a bad review for you. Long story short\u2014follow the formula of being qualified and persuasive, and don\u2019t forget the persistence part!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTake time to review openings carefully, apply for all the ones you qualify for, then write strong, compelling proposals. Let them know you\u2019re the advisor they\u2019re looking for! Optimize your proposals (and your profile, too) with relevant keywords and data points. Put in solid work up front, and it\u2019ll pay dividends over the long run as you pick up more gigs, establish your reputation, and build",

                "text": "\nWhen a client reaches out with a project, Third Bridge (and other networks) dive into their pool to find prospective advisors. The client selects the one they want to work with after asking questions and reviewing candidate proposals.\u00a0\n\nHow does Third Bridge make money from this transaction? The same way any middleman does; they charge a fee. In the case of expert networks, fees can be significant! Basically, an advisor sets their hourly consulting rate, then the expert network marks that rate up and keeps the difference.\u00a0\n\nLarge companies, startups, investors, and corporate consultants don\u2019t mind paying the markup in exchange for valuable strategic intel. Though it is not always possible to quantify the return on investment for such counsel, it\u2019s worth the money if they learn something that earns or saves them more than the consultation cost.\u00a0\n\n## What should you expect on a Third Bridge consulting call?\n\nSpeaking of costs, how much do Third Bridge specialists earn an hour, and what do they have to reveal on those calls? We\u2019ll get into rates in a little while, but let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s covered in an \u301010\u2020expert network project\u3011 call first.\u00a0\n\nCalls can be broadly categorized into one of three styles:\u00a0\n\nIndustry overview \u2014 Investors reach out to specialists to collect information they\u2019ll use to paint a \u201cbig picture\u201d that forecasts activity and informs decisions on investments or other strategic actions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompany deep dive \u2014 Deep dives are analytical, investigative explorations of target companies or a particular area within a company. Investors glean info on a company\u2019s growth potential or problems and respective consequences.\u00a0\n\nConsulting with consultants \u2014 Large companies have their own consultants (or contracted agencies), but it never hurts to reach out for additional objective insights.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge posts interviews with some of their specialists, such as Neil Farmer, founder of Farmer Associates. Neil describes his packaging and materials sector as a \u201cminefield to understand,\u201d saying he can \u201ctake people through what I know and share it with them so hopefully they can make good decisions, invest in companies, and grow the industry.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that expert networks exist to give companies an edge without breaking ethical guidelines or crossing legal boundaries. Advisors aren\u2019t allowed to disclose confidential or protected information. They must maintain strict standards during phone discussions. Failure to abide by Third Bridge\u2019s terms, or the terms set forth by the client, could result in dismissal from a project at a minimum. As noted on their \u301043\u2020webpage\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011, their \u201cstrict compliance framework is designed to protect our specialists and avoid the disclosure of confidential information, material nonpublic information, investment advice, and defamatory statements.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDig into our free, comprehensive \u301044\u2020Ultimate Expert Network Guide\u3011 to learn more secrets about high-paying consulting calls!\u00a0\n\n## Do I qualify as a subject matter expert?\u00a0\n\nAlas, the question everybody asks\u2014do I qualify? We can\u2019t answer that since we don\u2019t know you. But let\u2019s talk about what it takes to qualify as a \u201csubject matter expert\u201d in the first place.

                "text": "  * What do you think about the management team?\u00a0\n  * Which competitors are really winning and losing?\n\nThese clients love numbers and will probe for any key metrics you can share (without revealing confidential or inside information). It\u2019s worth pointing out that investors will rarely, if ever, ask for your thoughts on the share price.\u00a0It\u2019s their job to evaluate that.\n\n#### #2 \u2013 The Industry Overview\n\nInvestors may kick off their research by speaking with a few experts.\u00a0They often come into these paid consulting calls without much foundation, which can make these calls a cakewalk; you get to play the role of star professor while they lap up your every word.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese calls tend to dive down into who the major customers and suppliers are in your market segment, what the economics look like, and where the industry is headed.\u00a0Things will generally shift to your opinion on the leaders or breakout companies, and if there\u2019s an upstart product or technology, they\u2019ll want your perspective on how that may impact the industry.\u00a0\n\nYou may be asked for your quick take on several companies during a lightning round. But more frequently they\u2019ll want to know, \u201cwhat questions should we be asking?\u201d as they will be talking to others.\n\n#### #3 \u2013 Consulting to Consultants\n\nWhile investment firms are the largest client category for expert networks, management consultants are increasingly using expert calls to sharpen their insights.\u00a0Consulting firms are typically helping their clients launch a new product or business-line, improve the performance of one that is misfiring, or perform due diligence as part of an investment or acquisition.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese calls tend to revolve more around how things work, such as your process for evaluating a product or service that your company has recently purchased, or if a new product with certain features would be something you\u2019d consider using.\u00a0\n\nAgain, these calls are easy because clients will hang on your every word while happily paying you top dollar for your opinions (which they probably bill at 2X to their clients. ????)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n#### Expert Network Surveys\n\n[Image 3: Post boasting about a high number of GLG survey requests]\n\nMany expert networks also regularly conduct surveys on behalf of their clients. These tend to revolve around your perception of a set of products or what your expectations are for a market in the near future, such as if you expect your budget to grow, shrink or stay about the same and how you\u2019ll allocate it over the next year.\n\nThese invitation-only surveys generally take 10 \u2013 20 minutes to complete online and pay a fixed rate, that usually falls between $40 \u2013 $80. While they\u2019re generally not as lucrative as completing calls, they are an easy way to make a few extra bucks in your spare time. \n\n## How to Get Started with Expert Networks\n\n[Image 4: GLG consulting request LinkedIn]Expert networks like GLG heavily recruit new consultants via LinkedIn message about consulting opportunities.\n\nOne of the best parts of expert network consulting is there are opportunities for practically any professional. \n\nC-level executives charging over $1,000 per consulting call tend to get the headlines, but bread-and-butter projects go to upper and mid-level managers (you know, the people who actually DO stuff) in virtually any field: \n\n  * sales\n\n  * marketing\n  * finance\n  * manufacturing\n\n  * operations\n  * human resources\n  * strategy\n\n  * and more\n\nAnd that\u2019s not mentioning the countless projects in areas beyond business. Engineers, construction managers, small business owners, farmers, and former government officials are often in demand. \u30106\u2020Healthcare also comprises a meaningful chunk of the expert network industry\u3011, with a high volume of projects available to doctors, nurses, pharmacists, back office administrators, and veterinarians. \n\nReady to get started with expert networks? Here are your first steps mapped out.\n\n#### Step #1 \u2013 Get found\n\nExpert networks employ small armies of recent college graduates tasked with finding people who have the firsthand knowledge their clients are looking for on a project (AlphaSights ranks as one of the top 25 employers of new college grads!). \n\nThese associates spend much of their day trolling LinkedIn and looking for profiles that match up well with their project descriptions. They typically don\u2019t know much about the subject of the project itself; they\u2019re just trying to find people who match the requirements. (You may have found this page by doing some Googling about a paid consulting opportunity you received via a LinkedIn message!) Make it easy for them to connect with you on LinkinedIn by opening up the \u301044\u2020messaging settings\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 on your and/or including your email address in the Contact Info section of your profile.\n\n>>> \u301043\u2020Click here to register as a GLG Council Member and start receiving project opportunities.\u2020membership.glgresearch.com\u3011\n\n#### Step #2 \u2013 Optimize your LinkedIn profile\n\nStart by adding a descriptive and keyword-rich list of companies, products and industries to your profile (these should be subjects you can knowledgeably talk about). This will help your profile pop to the top of more keyword-driven searches. A good rule of thumb is if you could give a half hour presentation on a topic, you may be an expert in it. \n\nBe sure to list out former employers, vendors you closely work with, software and products you use regularly in your job, and close competitors you frequently butt heads with. Be specific about what your role entails, especially if you share the same title with dozens or hundreds of other people at the same organization (such as \u2018program manager\u2019 or \u2018vice president\u2019). If you own a budget or are the final decision maker on large purchase decisions, call that out directly as well. \n\nAssociates may scan through hundreds of profiles a day, so make it easy for them to see that you closely match the requirements in their project spec.\n\nLooking to fast-track your visibility?

However, \u201cThe Big Five\u201d firms are a good place to start:\n\n  * \u301024\u2020Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG)\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020AlphaSights\u2020www.alphasights.com\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Guidepoint Global\u3011\n\n  * \u301035\u2020Third Bridge\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Coleman Research\u3011\n\n(If you are especially interested in completing expert network surveys that generally pay $40 \u2013 $70, you should also register with up-and-coming networks like \u301018\u2020Atheneum\u3011, \u301022\u2020Dialectica\u3011, \u301027\u2020Maven Research\u3011, \u301030\u2020proSapient\u3011, \u301033\u2020techspert.io\u3011, and \u301046\u2020NewtonX\u2020www.newtonx.com\u3011.)\n\nYour expert network profile should look different than your resume or what you post on LinkedIn. Expert networks are interested in what you know, not what you can do, so omit the soft skills you typically list elsewhere. Your goals here are to show up near the top of the list in relevant search results and quickly convince an associate you match up well enough to their spec to earn an invitation to apply to their project. Associates will typically spend about 10 seconds scanning your profile, so make it SIMPLE AND EASY for them to find what they are looking for.\n\nRemember, most of the time associates know little (or nothing) about the subject matter of the project itself \u2013 they only know the qualifications the client is looking for. Those are the terms they are putting in the search query field, and those are the words or names they look for when they scan your profile. \n\nIt may only take a few keywords to land a project invite, so list out everything you are qualified to speak about in clear and organized lists. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a seasoned veteran in the sugary cereal business. \n\nYou would create detailed, cut-through keyword lists like this:\n\n  * I am an expert on cereal marketing, cereal product development, cereal pricing and promotion, food packaging design, and character licensing.\n  * I have five years of experience as a brand manager for General Mills monster cereals: Count Chocula, Boo Berry and Franken Berry.\n\n  * I compete directly with Kellogg\u2019s Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, and Coco Pops.\n  * I manage the $X million Got Milk cross-promotion and am a customer of Advertising Agency X, Marketing Agency Y, and Fulfillment Company Z.\n\nAlso, use an extremely direct headline or summary sentence to describe yourself. While you may have great success on LinkedIn by branding yourself with something clever like \u201cHelping America love breakfast\u201d, you don\u2019t want to beat around the bush in your expert network profiles and should make a beeline for a clearer description like \u201cBreakfast Cereal Brand Manager at General Mills\u201d.\n\nLooking to create an eye-catching expert network profile?

But for most opportunities, you will need to complete a few screening questions through an online form or brief phone call with an associate, especially if you are just",

                "text": "\nWhen a client reaches out with a project, Third Bridge (and other networks) dive into their pool to find prospective advisors. The client selects the one they want to work with after asking questions and reviewing candidate proposals.\u00a0\n\nHow does Third Bridge make money from this transaction? The same way any middleman does; they charge a fee. In the case of expert networks, fees can be significant! Basically, an advisor sets their hourly consulting rate, then the expert network marks that rate up and keeps the difference.\u00a0\n\nLarge companies, startups, investors, and corporate consultants don\u2019t mind paying the markup in exchange for valuable strategic intel. Though it is not always possible to quantify the return on investment for such counsel, it\u2019s worth the money if they learn something that earns or saves them more than the consultation cost.\u00a0\n\n## What should you expect on a Third Bridge consulting call?\n\nSpeaking of costs, how much do Third Bridge specialists earn an hour, and what do they have to reveal on those calls? We\u2019ll get into rates in a little while, but let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s covered in an \u301010\u2020expert network project\u3011 call first.\u00a0\n\nCalls can be broadly categorized into one of three styles:\u00a0\n\nIndustry overview \u2014 Investors reach out to specialists to collect information they\u2019ll use to paint a \u201cbig picture\u201d that forecasts activity and informs decisions on investments or other strategic actions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompany deep dive \u2014 Deep dives are analytical, investigative explorations of target companies or a particular area within a company. Investors glean info on a company\u2019s growth potential or problems and respective consequences.\u00a0\n\nConsulting with consultants \u2014 Large companies have their own consultants (or contracted agencies), but it never hurts to reach out for additional objective insights.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge posts interviews with some of their specialists, such as Neil Farmer, founder of Farmer Associates. Neil describes his packaging and materials sector as a \u201cminefield to understand,\u201d saying he can \u201ctake people through what I know and share it with them so hopefully they can make good decisions, invest in companies, and grow the industry.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that expert networks exist to give companies an edge without breaking ethical guidelines or crossing legal boundaries. Advisors aren\u2019t allowed to disclose confidential or protected information. They must maintain strict standards during phone discussions. Failure to abide by Third Bridge\u2019s terms, or the terms set forth by the client, could result in dismissal from a project at a minimum. As noted on their \u301043\u2020webpage\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011, their \u201cstrict compliance framework is designed to protect our specialists and avoid the disclosure of confidential information, material nonpublic information, investment advice, and defamatory statements.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDig into our free, comprehensive \u301044\u2020Ultimate Expert Network Guide\u3011 to learn more secrets about high-paying consulting calls!\u00a0\n\n## Do I qualify as a subject matter expert?\u00a0\n\nAlas, the question everybody asks\u2014do I qualify? We can\u2019t answer that since we don\u2019t know you. But let\u2019s talk about what it takes to qualify as a \u201csubject matter expert\u201d in the first place. Have you ever worked for a specific industry or a specific company for an extended period? If so, did you not acquire hard-won knowledge that might potentially be useful for others to hear?\u00a0\n\nIf the answer is yes, chances are you qualify to work on projects related to your field or prior employers. The truth is, you don\u2019t have to determine whether you\u2019re qualified or not. Let Third Bridge do that for you. And if you\u2019re concerned you\u2019d be an \u201cimposter,\u201d we suggest you let somebody else worry about that, too! Apply and let them figure out if they could use you or not.\u00a0\n\n## How do I set my Third Bridge consulting rate?\n\nThis is another popular question we see a lot. If you\u2019ve ever gotten a LinkedIn message or seen an ad from an expert network, you probably noticed part of their \u201chook\u201d is to dangle promises of fat checks in front of you. An ad might read \u201cEarn hundreds of dollars an hour!\u201d but is that really possible?\u00a0\n\nYes, it is! Some consultants do earn hundreds of dollars an hour.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge and their peers want highly paid pros in their network. Why? Because the more your hourly rate is, the more they\u2019re going to mark it up. That\u2019s right; they aren\u2019t looking to onboard people who undervalue their potential. On the contrary, they\u2019re seeking advisors who demand a lot for their valuable time, experts able to talk the talk and walk the walk. If you can deliver the goods, set your rate accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get specific. If you worked in a specialized role or held a position of high authority, expect to charge more. Seasoned professionals and mid-level executives make $300 \u2013 $500 an hour in some cases.\u00a0\n\nIf you were more generalized or lower on the totem pole, that\u2019s okay; just understand your insights may carry less monetary value to the clients. Thus, you might set a rate between $100 \u2013 $150/hour with Third Bridge.\n\nWhat about you C-suite types out there? You know who you are, and if you see dollar signs floating over your eyes right now, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve realized you could monetize your knowledge for up to thousands of dollars\u2014per hour!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u301045\u2020Third Bridge\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011 \u201cidentifies and interprets the context, narrative, causality, connection, and meaning in data or events.\u201d Their clients are looking for \u201cthe signal in the noise,\u201d meaning they need high-end, value-rich insights and are willing to pay top dollar for them. The ROI is worth it if a piece of advice results in a million-dollar decision tilting in the right direction.\u00a0\n\nCheck out our detailed brief on \u30109\u2020how to price your consulting services\u3011 to learn more.\u00a0\n\n## What are the downsides to consulting for Third Bridge?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf there\u2019s such a thing as a downside to earning hundreds of dollars for an hour-long phone, then please let us know!\u00a0\n\nBut seriously, the biggest downside seems to be that work isn\u2019t consistent. Most projects Third Bridge receives from clients only require a short consultation. Even though they have many, many clients, you won\u2019t be selected for every relevant project (and even if you did, clients won\u2019t always select you based on your proposal).\u00a0\n\nSo, a typical complaint on Glassdoor goes something like this:\u00a0\n\n[Image 3]\n\nThird Bridge consulting projects are often sporadic, last just one hour and are thus pretty much the opposite of a full-time gig, and there are zero guarantees of work. Some consultants are getting steady projects; some might only get picked up occasionally. Either way, in all fairness, that isn\u2019t Third Bridge\u2019s fault. Their job is merely to provide an arena where clients and consultants can connect. Whether that connection happens depends a lot on your actions.\u00a0\n\nFor example, knowing that other advisors are vying for the same projects should motivate all applicants to put their best foot forward during the proposal process. If you whisk through a proposal and don\u2019t demonstrate your potential value to the client, that client is apt to pass you over and hire the person who spent a good 5 or 10 minutes answering screening questions cogently.\u00a0\n\nAgain, there\u2019s no promise you\u2019ll get selected even if you do spend ample time on the proposals, and that can be frustrating. All you can do is keep trying\u2026or give up. The people who are successful keep trying and get better over time.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest complaints seem to stem from either miscommunication or misunderstood expectations. Like other expert networks, Third Bridge prorates billing. You might set an \u201chourly\u201d rate but they pay per minute, so if your call is only 50 minutes, they don\u2019t pay for 60.\u00a0\n\nWhile that seems fair to us, not all Third Bridge consultants share the sentiment:\n\n[Image 4] [Image 5] [Image 6] [Image 7]\n\nWith a bit of clarity and expectation management upfront in regards to billing, specialists can come away feeling like they were paid correctly.\u00a0\n\n## How can I win more Third Bridge consulting projects?\n\nThe trick to winning projects is to a) be qualified and b) be persuasive and persistent. If either of those is missing, you\u2019ll find yourself on the \u201cfamine\u201d side of their \u201cfeast or famine\u201d environment.\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean to be qualified? In their tagline, Third Bridge is about \u201cHuman insights. Better investment decisions.\u201d Think of that as a filter. Will your insights lead to better investment decisions for clients or not? Keep in mind, \u201cbetter\u201d refers to how good their decisions would be without your input. They don\u2019t just want good advice; they want better than average, expert-level advice. They want to hear something they couldn\u2019t find off Google.\u00a0\n\nHow do you convince them you can provide that? Again, you have to be qualified and persuasive! It doesn\u2019t do any good to be qualified if you can\u2019t convey that to them in your proposal. And it won\u2019t help anyone if you apply to a gig you actually can\u2019t help with. In fact, that\u2019ll lead to disappointment during the call and a bad review for you. Long story short\u2014follow the formula of being qualified and persuasive, and don\u2019t forget the persistence part!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTake time to review openings carefully, apply for all the ones you qualify for, then write strong, compelling proposals. Let them know you\u2019re the advisor they\u2019re looking for! Optimize your proposals (and your profile, too) with relevant keywords and data points. Put in solid work up front, and it\u2019ll pay dividends over the long run as you pick up more gigs, establish your reputation, and build",

The Tegus answer is to employ a different business model, reminiscent of a cross between Costco and a library.\n\nIn the Tegus business model, the investor (buyer) pays a membership fee to have access to all of the expert interviews on the platform, which are shared/contributory, not proprietary.\u00a0 Buyers can also ask follow-up questions on existing interviews.\u00a0 When a buyer wants a new interview they pay the cost of the interview plus a flat per interview fee.\u00a0 Each interview is anonymized, compliance-checked, recorded and transcribed, and presumably, after some delay, put on the platform to be shared with others.\u00a0 It appears that investors can also pay a premium to further delay the public posting of the interview.\n\nI think there is some real genius in this model:\n\n  * It\u2019s a more \u201ctrue\u201d subscription model\n  * Pricing is transparent\n  * Compliance is a whole lot more transparent\n  * And the time delay, plus an additional premium for more time delay, is pure pricing genius.\n\n(Note:\u00a0 some expert networks have had surveys, reports, and even transcripted interviews they commissioned themselves in a library, what\u2019s really new here is the contributory/shared model.)\n\n# Tegus Disruption\n\nThe market appears to like the Tegus approach.\u00a0 \u00a0According to LinkedIn, Tegus has 426 employees.\u00a0 At $200k in revenue per employee (a significant discount to GLG and AlphaSights which have $280k and $290k in revenue per employee respectively), Tegus is coming up on $100 million in annual revenue.\u00a0 A cursory glance at the market suggests Tegus is now in the fifth position.\u00a0 Tegus has achieved this, despite the other networks having a 10-15 year head start in a market that might have appeared to have\u00a0 \u201cwinner-take-most\u201d dynamics.\u00a0 Some of the company\u2019s competitors are adopting aspects of their business model by offering comparable, shared libraries.\n\n# Tegus Origin Story\n\nTwin brothers started Tegus.\u00a0 One was at an investor and one was at AlphaSights.\u00a0 The brothers realized that with all of the multi-homing going on on both sides of the marketplace, a shared model might work better. (Two-sided network, two-sided family!)\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting, is how the brothers chose to start Tegus.\u00a0 When you start a two-sided marketplace, you often have to pick a niche where you can solve the \u301040\u2020chicken and the egg dilemma\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011 of gaining liquidity.\u00a0 In this case, Tegus had to figure out which investors and experts to target.\u00a0 You simply can\u2019t cover every company and every area of expertise to start!\n\nThe Tegus founders chose to focus exclusively on public enterprise software companies in the US. It was a great choice for many reasons.\n\n  * A very limited universe of companies to cover, yet\n  * Huge market caps are at stake with lots of interested hedge fund investors\n  * There are many experts across disciplines and companies\n  * IPOs and acquisitions galore\n  * Public equity markets are a great fit with the business model of clean compliance and time-based pricing\n\n# Summary\n\nTegus is getting a lot of things right\u2013and yet it has a long way to go.\u00a0 The company is still getting established with experts, is still expanding its coverage, and Tegus is still US-centric.\u00a0 \u00a0Tegus remains in a battle with well-funded, established networks that are copying them.\u00a0 It is David against a few relative Goliaths.\n\nI\u2019m rooting for this hometown (Chicago) challenger\u2013assuming they are White Sox fans.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Email\n  * \u301041\u2020Print\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Facebook\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020LinkedIn\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Twitter\u3011\n  * \n\n### If you liked that post, you might enjoy these too...\n\n  * \u301045\u2020It's the pricing model, stupid!\u3011\n\nIn a prior post, I identified the right pricing model\u00a0as one of the key success factors for \"industry in the cloud\" (IC)\u00a0providers.\u00a0 Pricing is critical for all businesses, but it is especially critical (and complicated) for IC providers.

              "snippet": "  * What do you think about the management team?\u00a0\n  * Which competitors are really winning and losing?\n\nThese clients love numbers and will probe for any key metrics you can share (without revealing confidential or inside information). It\u2019s worth pointing out that investors will rarely, if ever, ask for your thoughts on the share price.\u00a0It\u2019s their job to evaluate that.\n\n#### #2 \u2013 The Industry Overview\n\nInvestors may kick off their research by speaking with a few experts.\u00a0They often come into these paid consulting calls without much foundation, which can make these calls a cakewalk; you get to play the role of star professor while they lap up your every word.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese calls tend to dive down into who the major customers and suppliers are in your market segment, what the economics look like, and where the industry is headed.\u00a0Things will generally shift to your opinion on the leaders or breakout companies, and if there\u2019s an upstart product or technology, they\u2019ll want your perspective on how that may impact the industry.\u00a0\n\nYou may be asked for your quick take on several companies during a lightning round. But more frequently they\u2019ll want to know, \u201cwhat questions should we be asking?\u201d as they will be talking to others.\n\n#### #3 \u2013 Consulting to Consultants\n\nWhile investment firms are the largest client category for expert networks, management consultants are increasingly using expert calls to sharpen their insights.\u00a0Consulting firms are typically helping their clients launch a new product or business-line, improve the performance of one that is misfiring, or perform due diligence as part of an investment or acquisition.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese calls tend to revolve more around how things work, such as your process for evaluating a product or service that your company has recently purchased, or if a new product with certain features would be something you\u2019d consider using.\u00a0\n\nAgain, these calls are easy because clients will hang on your every word while happily paying you top dollar for your opinions (which they probably bill at 2X to their clients. ????)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n#### Expert Network Surveys\n\n[Image 3: Post boasting about a high number of GLG survey requests]\n\nMany expert networks also regularly conduct surveys on behalf of their clients. These tend to revolve around your perception of a set of products or what your expectations are for a market in the near future, such as if you expect your budget to grow, shrink or stay about the same and how you\u2019ll allocate it over the next year.\n\nThese invitation-only surveys generally take 10 \u2013 20 minutes to complete online and pay a fixed rate, that usually falls between $40 \u2013 $80. While they\u2019re generally not as lucrative as completing calls, they are an easy way to make a few extra bucks in your spare time. \n\n## How to Get Started with Expert Networks\n\n[Image 4: GLG consulting request LinkedIn]Expert networks like GLG heavily recruit new consultants via LinkedIn message about consulting opportunities.\n\nOne of the best parts of expert network consulting is there are opportunities for practically any professional. \n\nC-level executives charging over $1,000 per consulting call tend to get the headlines, but bread-and-butter projects go to upper and mid-level managers (you know, the people who actually DO stuff) in virtually any field: \n\n  * sales\n\n  * marketing\n  * finance\n  * manufacturing\n\n  * operations\n  * human resources\n  * strategy\n\n  * and more\n\nAnd that\u2019s not mentioning the countless projects in areas beyond business. Engineers, construction managers, small business owners, farmers, and former government officials are often in demand. \u30106\u2020Healthcare also comprises a meaningful chunk of the expert network industry\u3011, with a high volume of projects available to doctors, nurses, pharmacists, back office administrators, and veterinarians. \n\nReady to get started with expert networks? Here are your first steps mapped out.\n\n#### Step #1 \u2013 Get found\n\nExpert networks employ small armies of recent college graduates tasked with finding people who have the firsthand knowledge their clients are looking for on a project (AlphaSights ranks as one of the top 25 employers of new college grads!). \n\nThese associates spend much of their day trolling LinkedIn and looking for profiles that match up well with their project descriptions. They typically don\u2019t know much about the subject of the project itself; they\u2019re just trying to find people who match the requirements. (You may have found this page by doing some Googling about a paid consulting opportunity you received via a LinkedIn message!) Make it easy for them to connect with you on LinkinedIn by opening up the \u301044\u2020messaging settings\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 on your and/or including your email address in the Contact Info section of your profile.\n\n>>> \u301043\u2020Click here to register as a GLG Council Member and start receiving project opportunities.\u2020membership.glgresearch.com\u3011\n\n#### Step #2 \u2013 Optimize your LinkedIn profile\n\nStart by adding a descriptive and keyword-rich list of companies, products and industries to your profile (these should be subjects you can knowledgeably talk about). This will help your profile pop to the top of more keyword-driven searches. A good rule of thumb is if you could give a half hour presentation on a topic, you may be an expert in it. \n\nBe sure to list out former employers, vendors you closely work with, software and products you use regularly in your job, and close competitors you frequently butt heads with. Be specific about what your role entails, especially if you share the same title with dozens or hundreds of other people at the same organization (such as \u2018program manager\u2019 or \u2018vice president\u2019). If you own a budget or are the final decision maker on large purchase decisions, call that out directly as well. \n\nAssociates may scan through hundreds of profiles a day, so make it easy for them to see that you closely match the requirements in their project spec.\n\nLooking to fast-track your visibility? Read our insider tips on how to spruce up your \u301011\u2020LinkedIn profile for expert networks\u3011\n\n#### Step #3 \u2013 Register with expert network companies\n\nOnce your LinkedIn profile is shipshape, the next step is to invest a few hours creating profiles directly with expert networks. \n\nThere are several hundred expert networks around the world, many of which are strong in certain geographies or industries and could be a great source of projects for you. However, \u201cThe Big Five\u201d firms are a good place to start:\n\n  * \u301024\u2020Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG)\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020AlphaSights\u2020www.alphasights.com\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Guidepoint Global\u3011\n\n  * \u301035\u2020Third Bridge\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Coleman Research\u3011\n\n(If you are especially interested in completing expert network surveys that generally pay $40 \u2013 $70, you should also register with up-and-coming networks like \u301018\u2020Atheneum\u3011, \u301022\u2020Dialectica\u3011, \u301027\u2020Maven Research\u3011, \u301030\u2020proSapient\u3011, \u301033\u2020techspert.io\u3011, and \u301046\u2020NewtonX\u2020www.newtonx.com\u3011.)\n\nYour expert network profile should look different than your resume or what you post on LinkedIn. Expert networks are interested in what you know, not what you can do, so omit the soft skills you typically list elsewhere. Your goals here are to show up near the top of the list in relevant search results and quickly convince an associate you match up well enough to their spec to earn an invitation to apply to their project. Associates will typically spend about 10 seconds scanning your profile, so make it SIMPLE AND EASY for them to find what they are looking for.\n\nRemember, most of the time associates know little (or nothing) about the subject matter of the project itself \u2013 they only know the qualifications the client is looking for. Those are the terms they are putting in the search query field, and those are the words or names they look for when they scan your profile. \n\nIt may only take a few keywords to land a project invite, so list out everything you are qualified to speak about in clear and organized lists. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a seasoned veteran in the sugary cereal business. \n\nYou would create detailed, cut-through keyword lists like this:\n\n  * I am an expert on cereal marketing, cereal product development, cereal pricing and promotion, food packaging design, and character licensing.\n  * I have five years of experience as a brand manager for General Mills monster cereals: Count Chocula, Boo Berry and Franken Berry.\n\n  * I compete directly with Kellogg\u2019s Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, and Coco Pops.\n  * I manage the $X million Got Milk cross-promotion and am a customer of Advertising Agency X, Marketing Agency Y, and Fulfillment Company Z.\n\nAlso, use an extremely direct headline or summary sentence to describe yourself. While you may have great success on LinkedIn by branding yourself with something clever like \u201cHelping America love breakfast\u201d, you don\u2019t want to beat around the bush in your expert network profiles and should make a beeline for a clearer description like \u201cBreakfast Cereal Brand Manager at General Mills\u201d.\n\nLooking to create an eye-catching expert network profile?

But for most opportunities, you will need to complete a few screening questions through an online form or brief phone call with an associate, especially if you are just",

              "snippet": "\nWhen a client reaches out with a project, Third Bridge (and other networks) dive into their pool to find prospective advisors. The client selects the one they want to work with after asking questions and reviewing candidate proposals.\u00a0\n\nHow does Third Bridge make money from this transaction? The same way any middleman does; they charge a fee. In the case of expert networks, fees can be significant! Basically, an advisor sets their hourly consulting rate, then the expert network marks that rate up and keeps the difference.\u00a0\n\nLarge companies, startups, investors, and corporate consultants don\u2019t mind paying the markup in exchange for valuable strategic intel. Though it is not always possible to quantify the return on investment for such counsel, it\u2019s worth the money if they learn something that earns or saves them more than the consultation cost.\u00a0\n\n## What should you expect on a Third Bridge consulting call?\n\nSpeaking of costs, how much do Third Bridge specialists earn an hour, and what do they have to reveal on those calls? We\u2019ll get into rates in a little while, but let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s covered in an \u301010\u2020expert network project\u3011 call first.\u00a0\n\nCalls can be broadly categorized into one of three styles:\u00a0\n\nIndustry overview \u2014 Investors reach out to specialists to collect information they\u2019ll use to paint a \u201cbig picture\u201d that forecasts activity and informs decisions on investments or other strategic actions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompany deep dive \u2014 Deep dives are analytical, investigative explorations of target companies or a particular area within a company. Investors glean info on a company\u2019s growth potential or problems and respective consequences.\u00a0\n\nConsulting with consultants \u2014 Large companies have their own consultants (or contracted agencies), but it never hurts to reach out for additional objective insights.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge posts interviews with some of their specialists, such as Neil Farmer, founder of Farmer Associates. Neil describes his packaging and materials sector as a \u201cminefield to understand,\u201d saying he can \u201ctake people through what I know and share it with them so hopefully they can make good decisions, invest in companies, and grow the industry.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that expert networks exist to give companies an edge without breaking ethical guidelines or crossing legal boundaries. Advisors aren\u2019t allowed to disclose confidential or protected information. They must maintain strict standards during phone discussions. Failure to abide by Third Bridge\u2019s terms, or the terms set forth by the client, could result in dismissal from a project at a minimum. As noted on their \u301043\u2020webpage\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011, their \u201cstrict compliance framework is designed to protect our specialists and avoid the disclosure of confidential information, material nonpublic information, investment advice, and defamatory statements.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDig into our free, comprehensive \u301044\u2020Ultimate Expert Network Guide\u3011 to learn more secrets about high-paying consulting calls!\u00a0\n\n## Do I qualify as a subject matter expert?\u00a0\n\nAlas, the question everybody asks\u2014do I qualify? We can\u2019t answer that since we don\u2019t know you. But let\u2019s talk about what it takes to qualify as a \u201csubject matter expert\u201d in the first place. Have you ever worked for a specific industry or a specific company for an extended period? If so, did you not acquire hard-won knowledge that might potentially be useful for others to hear?\u00a0\n\nIf the answer is yes, chances are you qualify to work on projects related to your field or prior employers. The truth is, you don\u2019t have to determine whether you\u2019re qualified or not. Let Third Bridge do that for you. And if you\u2019re concerned you\u2019d be an \u201cimposter,\u201d we suggest you let somebody else worry about that, too! Apply and let them figure out if they could use you or not.\u00a0\n\n## How do I set my Third Bridge consulting rate?\n\nThis is another popular question we see a lot. If you\u2019ve ever gotten a LinkedIn message or seen an ad from an expert network, you probably noticed part of their \u201chook\u201d is to dangle promises of fat checks in front of you. An ad might read \u201cEarn hundreds of dollars an hour!\u201d but is that really possible?\u00a0\n\nYes, it is! Some consultants do earn hundreds of dollars an hour.\u00a0\n\nThird Bridge and their peers want highly paid pros in their network. Why? Because the more your hourly rate is, the more they\u2019re going to mark it up. That\u2019s right; they aren\u2019t looking to onboard people who undervalue their potential. On the contrary, they\u2019re seeking advisors who demand a lot for their valuable time, experts able to talk the talk and walk the walk. If you can deliver the goods, set your rate accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get specific. If you worked in a specialized role or held a position of high authority, expect to charge more. Seasoned professionals and mid-level executives make $300 \u2013 $500 an hour in some cases.\u00a0\n\nIf you were more generalized or lower on the totem pole, that\u2019s okay; just understand your insights may carry less monetary value to the clients. Thus, you might set a rate between $100 \u2013 $150/hour with Third Bridge.\n\nWhat about you C-suite types out there? You know who you are, and if you see dollar signs floating over your eyes right now, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve realized you could monetize your knowledge for up to thousands of dollars\u2014per hour!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u301045\u2020Third Bridge\u2020thirdbridge.com\u3011 \u201cidentifies and interprets the context, narrative, causality, connection, and meaning in data or events.\u201d Their clients are looking for \u201cthe signal in the noise,\u201d meaning they need high-end, value-rich insights and are willing to pay top dollar for them. The ROI is worth it if a piece of advice results in a million-dollar decision tilting in the right direction.\u00a0\n\nCheck out our detailed brief on \u30109\u2020how to price your consulting services\u3011 to learn more.\u00a0\n\n## What are the downsides to consulting for Third Bridge?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf there\u2019s such a thing as a downside to earning hundreds of dollars for an hour-long phone, then please let us know!\u00a0\n\nBut seriously, the biggest downside seems to be that work isn\u2019t consistent. Most projects Third Bridge receives from clients only require a short consultation. Even though they have many, many clients, you won\u2019t be selected for every relevant project (and even if you did, clients won\u2019t always select you based on your proposal).\u00a0\n\nSo, a typical complaint on Glassdoor goes something like this:\u00a0\n\n[Image 3]\n\nThird Bridge consulting projects are often sporadic, last just one hour and are thus pretty much the opposite of a full-time gig, and there are zero guarantees of work. Some consultants are getting steady projects; some might only get picked up occasionally. Either way, in all fairness, that isn\u2019t Third Bridge\u2019s fault. Their job is merely to provide an arena where clients and consultants can connect. Whether that connection happens depends a lot on your actions.\u00a0\n\nFor example, knowing that other advisors are vying for the same projects should motivate all applicants to put their best foot forward during the proposal process. If you whisk through a proposal and don\u2019t demonstrate your potential value to the client, that client is apt to pass you over and hire the person who spent a good 5 or 10 minutes answering screening questions cogently.\u00a0\n\nAgain, there\u2019s no promise you\u2019ll get selected even if you do spend ample time on the proposals, and that can be frustrating. All you can do is keep trying\u2026or give up. The people who are successful keep trying and get better over time.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest complaints seem to stem from either miscommunication or misunderstood expectations. Like other expert networks, Third Bridge prorates billing. You might set an \u201chourly\u201d rate but they pay per minute, so if your call is only 50 minutes, they don\u2019t pay for 60.\u00a0\n\nWhile that seems fair to us, not all Third Bridge consultants share the sentiment:\n\n[Image 4] [Image 5] [Image 6] [Image 7]\n\nWith a bit of clarity and expectation management upfront in regards to billing, specialists can come away feeling like they were paid correctly.\u00a0\n\n## How can I win more Third Bridge consulting projects?\n\nThe trick to winning projects is to a) be qualified and b) be persuasive and persistent. If either of those is missing, you\u2019ll find yourself on the \u201cfamine\u201d side of their \u201cfeast or famine\u201d environment.\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean to be qualified? In their tagline, Third Bridge is about \u201cHuman insights. Better investment decisions.\u201d Think of that as a filter. Will your insights lead to better investment decisions for clients or not? Keep in mind, \u201cbetter\u201d refers to how good their decisions would be without your input. They don\u2019t just want good advice; they want better than average, expert-level advice. They want to hear something they couldn\u2019t find off Google.\u00a0\n\nHow do you convince them you can provide that? Again, you have to be qualified and persuasive! It doesn\u2019t do any good to be qualified if you can\u2019t convey that to them in your proposal. And it won\u2019t help anyone if you apply to a gig you actually can\u2019t help with. In fact, that\u2019ll lead to disappointment during the call and a bad review for you. Long story short\u2014follow the formula of being qualified and persuasive, and don\u2019t forget the persistence part!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTake time to review openings carefully, apply for all the ones you qualify for, then write strong, compelling proposals. Let them know you\u2019re the advisor they\u2019re looking for! Optimize your proposals (and your profile, too) with relevant keywords and data points. Put in solid work up front, and it\u2019ll pay dividends over the long run as you pick up more gigs, establish your reputation, and build",

              "snippet": "\nAccording to GLG\u2019s S-1, GLG\u2019s gross margin after expert fees, but before most other costs (except payments costs), is about 73%.\u00a0 There\u2019s your answer, GLG marks up expert fees 3-4x.\u00a0 In marketplace terms, that is GLG\u2019s take rate\u2013and it is substantial relative to most labor marketplaces.\u00a0 As we will see, this opaque and substantial margin forms the profit pool for Tegus to target.\n\n# Transactions Made Subscriptions\n\nTo my surprise, GLG reports that more than 90% of its revenue is recurring, subscription revenue.\u00a0 It seems GLG sells its clients time-based or consumption-based subscriptions.\u00a0 (Presumably, consumption-based subscriptions dominate, as time-based seem risky.)\u00a0 \u00a0These subscriptions appear to be pre-buys of a certain number of credits with each interview representing a number of credits.\u00a0 GLG only reports geographic segments, not by product or contract type, so it is a little hard to tell exactly how their pricing works.\n\n# The Tegus Business Model\n\nHow do you disrupt an established market that is relatively commoditized?\u00a0 After all, experts and investors can easily \u201cmulti-home\u201d on multiple networks.\u00a0 For experts, profiles are relatively easy to set up and incentives for exclusivity are relatively light.\u00a0 For investors, it\u2019s easy to sign up for multiple networks and InexOne will sell you a platform to make it even easier! The Tegus answer is to employ a different business model, reminiscent of a cross between Costco and a library.\n\nIn the Tegus business model, the investor (buyer) pays a membership fee to have access to all of the expert interviews on the platform, which are shared/contributory, not proprietary.\u00a0 Buyers can also ask follow-up questions on existing interviews.\u00a0 When a buyer wants a new interview they pay the cost of the interview plus a flat per interview fee.\u00a0 Each interview is anonymized, compliance-checked, recorded and transcribed, and presumably, after some delay, put on the platform to be shared with others.\u00a0 It appears that investors can also pay a premium to further delay the public posting of the interview.\n\nI think there is some real genius in this model:\n\n  * It\u2019s a more \u201ctrue\u201d subscription model\n  * Pricing is transparent\n  * Compliance is a whole lot more transparent\n  * And the time delay, plus an additional premium for more time delay, is pure pricing genius.\n\n(Note:\u00a0 some expert networks have had surveys, reports, and even transcripted interviews they commissioned themselves in a library, what\u2019s really new here is the contributory/shared model.)\n\n# Tegus Disruption\n\nThe market appears to like the Tegus approach.\u00a0 \u00a0According to LinkedIn, Tegus has 426 employees.\u00a0 At $200k in revenue per employee (a significant discount to GLG and AlphaSights which have $280k and $290k in revenue per employee respectively), Tegus is coming up on $100 million in annual revenue.\u00a0 A cursory glance at the market suggests Tegus is now in the fifth position.\u00a0 Tegus has achieved this, despite the other networks having a 10-15 year head start in a market that might have appeared to have\u00a0 \u201cwinner-take-most\u201d dynamics.\u00a0 Some of the company\u2019s competitors are adopting aspects of their business model by offering comparable, shared libraries.\n\n# Tegus Origin Story\n\nTwin brothers started Tegus.\u00a0 One was at an investor and one was at AlphaSights.\u00a0 The brothers realized that with all of the multi-homing going on on both sides of the marketplace, a shared model might work better. (Two-sided network, two-sided family!)\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting, is how the brothers chose to start Tegus.\u00a0 When you start a two-sided marketplace, you often have to pick a niche where you can solve the \u301040\u2020chicken and the egg dilemma\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011 of gaining liquidity.\u00a0 In this case, Tegus had to figure out which investors and experts to target.\u00a0 You simply can\u2019t cover every company and every area of expertise to start!\n\nThe Tegus founders chose to focus exclusively on public enterprise software companies in the US. It was a great choice for many reasons.\n\n  * A very limited universe of companies to cover, yet\n  * Huge market caps are at stake with lots of interested hedge fund investors\n  * There are many experts across disciplines and companies\n  * IPOs and acquisitions galore\n  * Public equity markets are a great fit with the business model of clean compliance and time-based pricing\n\n# Summary\n\nTegus is getting a lot of things right\u2013and yet it has a long way to go.\u00a0 The company is still getting established with experts, is still expanding its coverage, and Tegus is still US-centric.\u00a0 \u00a0Tegus remains in a battle with well-funded, established networks that are copying them.\u00a0 It is David against a few relative Goliaths.\n\nI\u2019m rooting for this hometown (Chicago) challenger\u2013assuming they are White Sox fans.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Email\n  * \u301041\u2020Print\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Facebook\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020LinkedIn\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Twitter\u3011\n  * \n\n### If you liked that post, you might enjoy these too...\n\n  * \u301045\u2020It's the pricing model, stupid!\u3011\n\nIn a prior post, I identified the right pricing model\u00a0as one of the key success factors for \"industry in the cloud\" (IC)\u00a0providers.\u00a0 Pricing is critical for all businesses, but it is especially critical (and complicated) for IC providers.

Are you wondering what this opportunity is legit or a scam? Learn what to expect and how to land high-paying consulting projects with one of Europe\u2019s fastest growing expert networks in our Dialectica review.\n\n## What is Dialectica?\n\n[Image 1: Dialecticanet logo]\n\n\u301040\u2020Dialectica\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011 is an an expert network, a recruiting firm that specializes in custom sourcing subject matter experts for short-term consulting projects. Expert networks are a \u301041\u2020$2 billion industry\u2020www.integrity-research.com\u3011 that cater to institutional investors (management consulting firms, private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, etc.) doing market research or performing due diligence on a company or subset of companies in preparation for an investment. Expert network opportunities generally take the form of a 1-hour phone consultation between the subject matter expert and the client. Expert networks are a great way to capitalize on your industry experience, even after you leave!\n\nFounded in 2015 by former management consultants George Tsarouchas and Fred Corkett, the firm now has over 900 employees across 4 offices in Athens, London, New York, and Montreal. Dialectica offers \u301042\u2020three core ways to connect experts and clients\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011: 1-to-1 expert calls, paid surveys, and analyst-led discussions.\n\nDialectica is certainly a legit company. It has facilitated over 20,000 projects and was included in the \u301043\u2020Financial Times\u2019 list of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies\u2020www.businesswire.com\u3011 in 2023 for the third consecutive year! It was the fastest growing expert network on the list, ranking #226 on the list with \u20ac41 million in 2021 revenue \u2013 682% growth since 2018. (Larger European expert network \u301018\u2020Atheneum Partners\u3011 also made the list at #725.)\n\n## What\u2019s it like to consult on a Dialectica project?\n\nIf you have been contacted by an associate from Dialectica, \u301011\u2020your LinkedIn profile\u3011 likely indicated that you would be a good fit for a consulting project, based on these typical criteria:\n\n  * You used to work at a company a client is trying to learn more about. The general rule of thumb is that you must be at least 6 months removed from the target company.\n\n  * You currently or used to work for a competitor to a company the client is trying to learn more about.\n  * You have relevant experience in a parallel industry or market, or worked for a company that was customer of the target company.\n\nThe associate will send you a link to a questionnaire that will ask for more details on your relevant work history, as well as a sampling of the questions the client will want to ask in the 1-hour phone consult. It\u2019s important to understand that these questions are not meant to replace the interview, just \u301012\u2020prove that you have the knowledge and experience they are looking for\u3011. The questionnaire shouldn\u2019t take more than 10 minutes to fill out. You may also be asked to give your availability for a 1-hour call.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that even if an associate thinks you are a good fit for the project, and you think you are a good fit for the project (based on the vetting questions), there is a chance you may not be selected for a call. The associate will submit your profile to the client for review, and there are plenty of factors that affect whether you get the project: consulting rate, vetting question response time, time to accept the compliance document, and other factors outside of your control. Even if you don\u2019t get this project, going through these motions will register your in their database and ensure you are identified quickly for future engagements.\n\nIn talking to other experts, I\u2019ve heard a few complaints about Dialectica project spam \u2013 frequent consulting requests for projects that are significantly far off topic. Making sure your Dialectica \u301011\u2020profile is crisp and specific\u3011 is a good way to cut down on off-targets requests (and land more on-point opportunities). The survey and consulting requests that I receive from Dialectica have mostly been well targeted at my area of expertise.\n\n## Setting your Dialectica Consulting Rate\n\n[Image 2: Reddit post asking about where to set your rate for a Dialectica project]\n\n\u30109\u2020Expert network consulting rates\u3011 vary widely and are dependent on how recent your experience is, the depth of your experience, and job title. Typically, you will receive project requests for experience in companies or job titles within the last 3 years, but the more recent your experience is, the higher likelihood you have of landing the client call. Similarly, the higher your job titles, the higher rate you can command.\n\nTypically, you will be offered $100-$200 for a role below the Director level. A Director or above will likely be offered $200-$350 for participation in a call. While you can absolutely negotiate for a higher rate (and you should!), it\u2019s unlikely that you will be successful in securing more than $100 above the initial offer for your first call.\u00a0\n\nYou can always renegotiate each time you are contacted for an opportunity. You should try to gauge the demand for your experience\u2014 are you receiving a high volume of requests? \u2014 and evaluate how niche your industry or experience is to determine a fair rate. Some experts can command rates of $500- $1,000, but those experts are often in small or niche industries where it is difficult to source experts, or they are trusted experts who have completed several successful calls and proven their worth to a network.\n\nYou should also know that your Dialecticanet rate will be pro-rated (by the minute) based on the amount of time you are in a call. If the call goes under 1 hour, you will not be paid for the entire hour. Conversely, if the call goes over the hour, you can expect to be paid more than the initial negotiated rate.\u00a0\n\n## Acing Your Dialectica Consulting Call\n\n[Image 3: Dialectica consulting projects]\n\nAn \u30105\u2020expert network consulting call\u3011 is not like other types of consulting engagements in that you are not expected to prepare or generate a deliverable. The questions the client will be asking should be easy for you to answer, based on the depth and breadth of your experience in a given industry. If you are asked a question you don\u2019t now the answer to, it\u2019s best to admit you don\u2019t know and offer to follow-up with the answer, or give it your best educated opinion.\u00a0\n\nMost calls are centered in a company the client is performing due diligence on. In this case, the client will want to understand the target company\u2019s positioning, go-to-market strategy, business model, key challenges and opportunities, and the competitive landscape. The client will likely have done extensive research on the company and industry, and are getting a sense of the company\u2019s growth prospects by testing their hypotheses against your knowledge.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that clients are not seeking proprietary information on the company. In fact, exchanging proprietary information in an expert network consulting call is illegal and \u30107\u2020considered insider trading\u3011. Many calls are recorded and transcribed for internal purposes and subjected to compliance tests. The compliance terms will be laid out to you in a non-disclosure agreement prior to the call. Regardless, you should use your best professional judgement when answering questions to avoid any compliance issues.\u00a0\n\n## Getting Started with Dialectica\n\nNow that you\u2019re part of the network, you will be contacted for more projects that align with your experience. Expert networks are a great way to capitalize on your career and knowledge. If you haven\u2019 t been contacted by an associate , you can still register on the Dialecticanet website to be added to their network by \u301044\u2020signing up to be a specialist here\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011.\n\n### What does Dialectica mean?\n\nFinally in case you\u2019re wondering (I was), Dialectica is play on the word Dialectic, which is defined as:\n\nany systematic reasoning, exposition (see exposition sense 2a), or argument that juxtaposes opposed or contradictory ideas and usually seeks to resolve their conflict\u00a0: a method of examining and discussing opposing ideas in order to find the truth. b. : an intellectual exchange of ideas.\n\nNot a bad name for an expert network!\n\n  * Author\n  * Recent Posts\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u301038\u2020Mitchel Harad\u3011\n\nOver a decade ago, I responded to a LinkedIn message asking me to provide my thoughts on a vendor I was using at work during a paid one-hour phone call.

Are you wondering what this opportunity is legit or a scam? Learn what to expect and how to land high-paying consulting projects with one of Europe\u2019s fastest growing expert networks in our Dialectica review.\n\n## What is Dialectica?\n\n[Image 1: Dialecticanet logo]\n\n\u301040\u2020Dialectica\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011 is an an expert network, a recruiting firm that specializes in custom sourcing subject matter experts for short-term consulting projects. Expert networks are a \u301041\u2020$2 billion industry\u2020www.integrity-research.com\u3011 that cater to institutional investors (management consulting firms, private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, etc.) doing market research or performing due diligence on a company or subset of companies in preparation for an investment. Expert network opportunities generally take the form of a 1-hour phone consultation between the subject matter expert and the client. Expert networks are a great way to capitalize on your industry experience, even after you leave!\n\nFounded in 2015 by former management consultants George Tsarouchas and Fred Corkett, the firm now has over 900 employees across 4 offices in Athens, London, New York, and Montreal. Dialectica offers \u301042\u2020three core ways to connect experts and clients\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011: 1-to-1 expert calls, paid surveys, and analyst-led discussions.\n\nDialectica is certainly a legit company. It has facilitated over 20,000 projects and was included in the \u301043\u2020Financial Times\u2019 list of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies\u2020www.businesswire.com\u3011 in 2023 for the third consecutive year! It was the fastest growing expert network on the list, ranking #226 on the list with \u20ac41 million in 2021 revenue \u2013 682% growth since 2018. (Larger European expert network \u301018\u2020Atheneum Partners\u3011 also made the list at #725.)\n\n## What\u2019s it like to consult on a Dialectica project?\n\nIf you have been contacted by an associate from Dialectica, \u301011\u2020your LinkedIn profile\u3011 likely indicated that you would be a good fit for a consulting project, based on these typical criteria:\n\n  * You used to work at a company a client is trying to learn more about. The general rule of thumb is that you must be at least 6 months removed from the target company.\n\n  * You currently or used to work for a competitor to a company the client is trying to learn more about.\n  * You have relevant experience in a parallel industry or market, or worked for a company that was customer of the target company.\n\nThe associate will send you a link to a questionnaire that will ask for more details on your relevant work history, as well as a sampling of the questions the client will want to ask in the 1-hour phone consult. It\u2019s important to understand that these questions are not meant to replace the interview, just \u301012\u2020prove that you have the knowledge and experience they are looking for\u3011. The questionnaire shouldn\u2019t take more than 10 minutes to fill out. You may also be asked to give your availability for a 1-hour call.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that even if an associate thinks you are a good fit for the project, and you think you are a good fit for the project (based on the vetting questions), there is a chance you may not be selected for a call. The associate will submit your profile to the client for review, and there are plenty of factors that affect whether you get the project: consulting rate, vetting question response time, time to accept the compliance document, and other factors outside of your control. Even if you don\u2019t get this project, going through these motions will register your in their database and ensure you are identified quickly for future engagements.\n\nIn talking to other experts, I\u2019ve heard a few complaints about Dialectica project spam \u2013 frequent consulting requests for projects that are significantly far off topic. Making sure your Dialectica \u301011\u2020profile is crisp and specific\u3011 is a good way to cut down on off-targets requests (and land more on-point opportunities). The survey and consulting requests that I receive from Dialectica have mostly been well targeted at my area of expertise.\n\n## Setting your Dialectica Consulting Rate\n\n[Image 2: Reddit post asking about where to set your rate for a Dialectica project]\n\n\u30109\u2020Expert network consulting rates\u3011 vary widely and are dependent on how recent your experience is, the depth of your experience, and job title. Typically, you will receive project requests for experience in companies or job titles within the last 3 years, but the more recent your experience is, the higher likelihood you have of landing the client call. Similarly, the higher your job titles, the higher rate you can command.\n\nTypically, you will be offered $100-$200 for a role below the Director level. A Director or above will likely be offered $200-$350 for participation in a call. While you can absolutely negotiate for a higher rate (and you should!), it\u2019s unlikely that you will be successful in securing more than $100 above the initial offer for your first call.\u00a0\n\nYou can always renegotiate each time you are contacted for an opportunity. You should try to gauge the demand for your experience\u2014 are you receiving a high volume of requests? \u2014 and evaluate how niche your industry or experience is to determine a fair rate. Some experts can command rates of $500- $1,000, but those experts are often in small or niche industries where it is difficult to source experts, or they are trusted experts who have completed several successful calls and proven their worth to a network.\n\nYou should also know that your Dialecticanet rate will be pro-rated (by the minute) based on the amount of time you are in a call. If the call goes under 1 hour, you will not be paid for the entire hour. Conversely, if the call goes over the hour, you can expect to be paid more than the initial negotiated rate.\u00a0\n\n## Acing Your Dialectica Consulting Call\n\n[Image 3: Dialectica consulting projects]\n\nAn \u30105\u2020expert network consulting call\u3011 is not like other types of consulting engagements in that you are not expected to prepare or generate a deliverable. The questions the client will be asking should be easy for you to answer, based on the depth and breadth of your experience in a given industry. If you are asked a question you don\u2019t now the answer to, it\u2019s best to admit you don\u2019t know and offer to follow-up with the answer, or give it your best educated opinion.\u00a0\n\nMost calls are centered in a company the client is performing due diligence on. In this case, the client will want to understand the target company\u2019s positioning, go-to-market strategy, business model, key challenges and opportunities, and the competitive landscape. The client will likely have done extensive research on the company and industry, and are getting a sense of the company\u2019s growth prospects by testing their hypotheses against your knowledge.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that clients are not seeking proprietary information on the company. In fact, exchanging proprietary information in an expert network consulting call is illegal and \u30107\u2020considered insider trading\u3011. Many calls are recorded and transcribed for internal purposes and subjected to compliance tests. The compliance terms will be laid out to you in a non-disclosure agreement prior to the call. Regardless, you should use your best professional judgement when answering questions to avoid any compliance issues.\u00a0\n\n## Getting Started with Dialectica\n\nNow that you\u2019re part of the network, you will be contacted for more projects that align with your experience. Expert networks are a great way to capitalize on your career and knowledge. If you haven\u2019 t been contacted by an associate , you can still register on the Dialecticanet website to be added to their network by \u301044\u2020signing up to be a specialist here\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011.\n\n### What does Dialectica mean?\n\nFinally in case you\u2019re wondering (I was), Dialectica is play on the word Dialectic, which is defined as:\n\nany systematic reasoning, exposition (see exposition sense 2a), or argument that juxtaposes opposed or contradictory ideas and usually seeks to resolve their conflict\u00a0: a method of examining and discussing opposing ideas in order to find the truth. b. : an intellectual exchange of ideas.\n\nNot a bad name for an expert network!\n\n  * Author\n  * Recent Posts\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u301038\u2020Mitchel Harad\u3011\n\nOver a decade ago, I responded to a LinkedIn message asking me to provide my thoughts on a vendor I was using at work during a paid one-hour phone call. The call was interesting and the money was nice, so I soon found myself regularly participating in short and",

Dialectica offers \u301042\u2020three core ways to connect experts and clients\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011: 1-to-1 expert calls, paid surveys, and analyst-led discussions.\n\nDialectica is certainly a legit company. It has facilitated over 20,000 projects and was included in the \u301043\u2020Financial Times\u2019 list of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies\u2020www.businesswire.com\u3011 in 2023 for the third consecutive year! It was the fastest growing expert network on the list, ranking #226 on the list with \u20ac41 million in 2021 revenue \u2013 682% growth since 2018. (Larger European expert network \u301018\u2020Atheneum Partners\u3011 also made the list at #725.)\n\n## What\u2019s it like to consult on a Dialectica project?\n\nIf you have been contacted by an associate from Dialectica, \u301011\u2020your LinkedIn profile\u3011 likely indicated that you would be a good fit for a consulting project, based on these typical criteria:\n\n  * You used to work at a company a client is trying to learn more about. The general rule of thumb is that you must be at least 6 months removed from the target company.\n\n  * You currently or used to work for a competitor to a company the client is trying to learn more about.\n  * You have relevant experience in a parallel industry or market, or worked for a company that was customer of the target company.\n\nThe associate will send you a link to a questionnaire that will ask for more details on your relevant work history, as well as a sampling of the questions the client will want to ask in the 1-hour phone consult. It\u2019s important to understand that these questions are not meant to replace the interview, just \u301012\u2020prove that you have the knowledge and experience they are looking for\u3011. The questionnaire shouldn\u2019t take more than 10 minutes to fill out. You may also be asked to give your availability for a 1-hour call.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that even if an associate thinks you are a good fit for the project, and you think you are a good fit for the project (based on the vetting questions), there is a chance you may not be selected for a call. The associate will submit your profile to the client for review, and there are plenty of factors that affect whether you get the project: consulting rate, vetting question response time, time to accept the compliance document, and other factors outside of your control. Even if you don\u2019t get this project, going through these motions will register your in their database and ensure you are identified quickly for future engagements.\n\nIn talking to other experts, I\u2019ve heard a few complaints about Dialectica project spam \u2013 frequent consulting requests for projects that are significantly far off topic. Making sure your Dialectica \u301011\u2020profile is crisp and specific\u3011 is a good way to cut down on off-targets requests (and land more on-point opportunities). The survey and consulting requests that I receive from Dialectica have mostly been well targeted at my area of expertise.\n\n## Setting your Dialectica Consulting Rate\n\n[Image 2: Reddit post asking about where to set your rate for a Dialectica project]\n\n\u30109\u2020Expert network consulting rates\u3011 vary widely and are dependent on how recent your experience is, the depth of your experience, and job title. Typically, you will receive project requests for experience in companies or job titles within the last 3 years, but the more recent your experience is, the higher likelihood you have of landing the client call. Similarly, the higher your job titles, the higher rate you can command.\n\nTypically, you will be offered $100-$200 for a role below the Director level. A Director or above will likely be offered $200-$350 for participation in a call. While you can absolutely negotiate for a higher rate (and you should!), it\u2019s unlikely that you will be successful in securing more than $100 above the initial offer for your first call.\u00a0\n\nYou can always renegotiate each time you are contacted for an opportunity. You should try to gauge the demand for your experience\u2014 are you receiving a high volume of requests? \u2014 and evaluate how niche your industry or experience is to determine a fair rate. Some experts can command rates of $500- $1,000, but those experts are often in small or niche industries where it is difficult to source experts, or they are trusted experts who have completed several successful calls and proven their worth to a network.\n\nYou should also know that your Dialecticanet rate will be pro-rated (by the minute) based on the amount of time you are in a call. If the call goes under 1 hour, you will not be paid for the entire hour. Conversely, if the call goes over the hour, you can expect to be paid more than the initial negotiated rate.\u00a0\n\n## Acing Your Dialectica Consulting Call\n\n[Image 3: Dialectica consulting projects]\n\nAn \u30105\u2020expert network consulting call\u3011 is not like other types of consulting engagements in that you are not expected to prepare or generate a deliverable. The questions the client will be asking should be easy for you to answer, based on the depth and breadth of your experience in a given industry. If you are asked a question you don\u2019t now the answer to, it\u2019s best to admit you don\u2019t know and offer to follow-up with the answer, or give it your best educated opinion.\u00a0\n\nMost calls are centered in a company the client is performing due diligence on. In this case, the client will want to understand the target company\u2019s positioning, go-to-market strategy, business model, key challenges and opportunities, and the competitive landscape. The client will likely have done extensive research on the company and industry, and are getting a sense of the company\u2019s growth prospects by testing their hypotheses against your knowledge.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that clients are not seeking proprietary information on the company. In fact, exchanging proprietary information in an expert network consulting call is illegal and \u30107\u2020considered insider trading\u3011. Many calls are recorded and transcribed for internal purposes and subjected to compliance tests. The compliance terms will be laid out to you in a non-disclosure agreement prior to the call. Regardless, you should use your best professional judgement when answering questions to avoid any compliance issues.\u00a0\n\n## Getting Started with Dialectica\n\nNow that you\u2019re part of the network, you will be contacted for more projects that align with your experience. Expert networks are a great way to capitalize on your career and knowledge. If you haven\u2019 t been contacted by an associate , you can still register on the Dialecticanet website to be added to their network by \u301044\u2020signing up to be a specialist here\u2020dialecticanet.com\u3011.\n\n### What does Dialectica mean?\n\nFinally in case you\u2019re wondering (I was), Dialectica is play on the word Dialectic, which is defined as:\n\nany systematic reasoning, exposition (see exposition sense 2a), or argument that juxtaposes opposed or contradictory ideas and usually seeks to resolve their conflict\u00a0: a method of examining and discussing opposing ideas in order to find the truth. b. : an intellectual exchange of ideas.\n\nNot a bad name for an expert network!\n\n  * Author\n  * Recent Posts\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u301038\u2020Mitchel Harad\u3011\n\nOver a decade ago, I responded to a LinkedIn message asking me to provide my thoughts on a vendor I was using at work during a paid one-hour phone call. The call was interesting and the money was nice, so I soon found myself regularly participating in short and",
