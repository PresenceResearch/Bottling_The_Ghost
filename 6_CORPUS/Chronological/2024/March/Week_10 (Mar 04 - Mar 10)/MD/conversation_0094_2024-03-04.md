As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have specific information on the Baltimore County solar setback requirements for commercial buildings. However, setback requirements for solar installations typically vary depending on local zoning ordinances and building codes. 

To find the most accurate and up-to-date information, I would recommend reaching out to the Baltimore County Department of Permits, Approvals, and Inspections (PAI) or the Planning Department. They should be able to provide you with the specific setback requirements for solar installations on commercial buildings within the county.
