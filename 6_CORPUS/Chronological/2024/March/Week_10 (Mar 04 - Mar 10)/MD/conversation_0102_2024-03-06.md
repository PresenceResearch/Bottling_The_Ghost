Companies sign solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) contracts for several reasons:

1. **Cost Savings**: Solar PPAs often offer fixed or lower electricity rates compared to traditional utility tariffs, enabling companies to reduce their energy costs over the long term.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: Solar PPAs can hedge against future electricity price volatility, providing stability and predictability in energy costs, which is particularly valuable for companies susceptible to fluctuating energy prices.

3. **Sustainability Goals**: Many companies are committed to reducing their carbon footprint and achieving sustainability targets. Signing solar PPAs allows them to procure renewable energy and demonstrate their environmental responsibility.

4. **Energy Independence**: By generating electricity on-site or through off-site solar projects, companies can reduce reliance on the grid and ensure a more reliable energy supply, especially in regions prone to power outages or grid instability.
