I am hosting a webinar called "Solar for Business 101".  It is a presentation designed to teach the basics of commercial solar to business owners as well as churches, and schools that would be PPA Customers.  Start with some historical statistics on solar in the US and particularly in the mid-atlantic.  This presentation specifically focuses on Maryland, Virginia, Washington, DC, PEnnsylvania, and New Jersey
