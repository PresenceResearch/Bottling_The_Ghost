Please create a presentation based on the following outline Presentation 
Please start with a brief synopsis of the solar industry in the United States emphasizing the introduction of the federal tax credit and go through the ups and downs of the 2010s. Describe the IRA and how it has impacted the industry. 

Go through a very basic explanation of how solar works. Sun hits the panels dc electricity to inverters. Inverter turns to AC and then electricity is used by the building just like it is from the utility. Briefly describe how net metering works. 

Switch to the economics of solar. Outline the three major ways you can go solar - purchase PPA and community solar.  Create one slide with examples and reasons why people make that choice for each and then a summary slide with a table comparing the three.  Create criteria that accurately compares the offerings with important metrics.

Split into two categories, ownership and third party and start with ownership.  This is where we break down the incentives and payback periods.  Create a very basic analysis of how systems generate value and revenue

Cost
Non-production based incentives
30% Federal Tax Credit
State Grant / Incentive (If any)
Bonus Depreciation - bring up new legislation 
Could have others on a case by case basis

Production based incentives 
Electricity savings 
SREC Income 

Go into how electricity savings work.  
First we want to know how many kWh you use per year.  Why annual?  Because usage and production can vary greatly month to month.  Show graph of annual usage v annual production and how they differ.  Then show screenshot of maple springs PEPCO bill with overproduction.  Start with rate they are paying and then deduct per kWh.  Remember that your bill will never be $0 because of some fixed costs but it can come close.  

Second and most importantly we want to know how much your electricity costs because the higher the cost of electricity the more valuable the solar production is.  This is one of the reasons solar took off so quickly in california - power is incredibly expensive there.

Then go into SRECS
What is an SREC - Solar Renewable Energy Credit - it is the GENERATION ATTRIBUTE of the solar produced.  What does this mean.

Some states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard.  This means that the power company is required to include a certain portion of solar energy in the power the distribute.  Some states have none, some states are very aggressive - often aligning with their Carbon Reduction goals.  

Create slide based on Washington DC RPS and their carbon reduction / carbon neutral goals.  

Should the utility company fail to comply with the RPS they are required to pay a fine, or the ACP (Alternative Compliance Payment).  So for every 1000 kWh (1 kWh) they fall short they pay this fine.

For example if the requirement is 100 mWh and the utility produces 90 mWh of solar, they are short 10 mWh.  If the fine is $50/mWh then they owe $500.

So let’s say you own a solar system that produced 10 mWh of solar.  The utility company will ask you if you would kindly let them tell the utility that they actually produced this energy.  You being s savvy businessperson, tell them sure.  But it’s gonna cost them.  So the utility company, being savvy businesspeople themselves, offer to pay you $40 per mWh.  Cheaper for them than paying the finer and you are making money for an asset that you don’t need.  

1mWh = 1 SREC.  Price determined by state RPS and ACP.  This creates the market and price is set by RPS requirement.  Aggressive RPS = strong demand and high prices.  Weak demand = lower prices.

Case Study
500 kW system 
$1,000,000
600,000 kWh/year
DC $.17 kWh $435 SREC
MD - $.15/kWh - $75 SREC
VA - $.13/kWh - $35 SREC
NJ - $.22 kWh - $110/SREC
30% ITC
60% Bonus depreciation

PPA What if you don't have $1,000,000 and still want solar?
PPA = Power Purchase Agreement
3rd party owns the system
takes all of the incentives
sells you the power at a discount at an agreed upon rate
rate calculated by market
rate can be fixed for 25 years
Lock in electricity costs for 25 years
Electricity rates in the mid-atlantic have been stable for the last 10 years or so but are rising fast.  Paste Press Release for PEPCO/BGE rate increases.  
Show PPA graph with straight line 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU CAN USE ALL OF THE POWER ONSITE

What if I own a building that is triple net?  Or if the roof is big and the usage is low?  Warehouse for example
COMMUNITY SOLAR
This is where that third party owns the solar system, keeps all of the incentives, and sells the electricity to third party subscribers
What does this mean for you?  You receive an annual lease payment, an upfront payment, or a combination of the two.  
Think of it like a cell phone tower on your roof.  You lease the space, do nothing, and get paid.  
Frequently people will incorporate a new roof into this arrangement if the project economics can support it.  

So if I can get solar on my roof for free why isn't everyone doing it?
Insert chart from Colin's presentation.

OK - I'm in - how does this work?

 We have an initial discovery call to undetrstand your unique situation.  We determine if solar is viable for your site and what option is best for you.  
We information gather (bills, site charactaristics)
We run our numbers
Second meeting where we present preliminary numbers.  If these make sense for you we 
Enter into LOI/stage.  We perform more thorough analysis - firm up numbers
Present final numbers.
Sign agreements
off we go.

Go through a very basic explanation of how solar works. Sun hits the panels dc electricity to inverters. Inverter turns to AC and then electricity is used by the building just like it is from the utility. 
Briefly describe how net metering works. 

Switch to the economics of solar. Outline the three major ways you can go solar - purchase PPA and community solar.

Split into two categories, ownership and third party and start with ownership.  This is where we break down the incentives and payback periods.  Create a very basic analysis of how systems generate value and revenue

Purchase Option
Non-production based incentives
30% Federal Tax Credit
State Grant / Incentive (If any)
Bonus Depreciation - bring up new legislation 
Could have others on a case by case basis (property tax credit, IRA Adders, REAP)

Production based incentives 
Electricity savings 
SREC Income 
Electricity Savings
First we want to know how many kWh you use per year.  Why annual?  Because usage and production can vary greatly month to month.  Show graph of annual usage v annual production and how they differ.  
Then show screenshot of maple springs PEPCO bill with overproduction.  
Start with rate they are paying and then deduct per kWh.  Remember that your bill will never be $0 because of some fixed costs but it can come close.  
Second and most importantly we want to know how much your electricity costs because the higher the cost of electricity the more valuable the solar production is.  This is one of the reasons solar took off so quickly in california - power is incredibly expensive there.

SRECS - What is an SREC - Solar Renewable Energy Credit - it is the GENERATION ATTRIBUTE of the solar produced.  What does this mean?
Some states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard.  This means that the power company is required to include a certain portion of solar energy in the power the distribute.  Some states have none, some states are very aggressive - often aligning with their Carbon Reduction goals.  
Create slide based on Washington DC RPS and their carbon reduction / carbon neutral goals.  
Should the utility company fail to comply with the RPS they are required to pay a fine, or the ACP (Alternative Compliance Payment).  So for every 1000 kWh (1 kWh) they fall short they pay this fine
For example if the requirement is 100 mWh and the utility produces 90 mWh of solar, they are short 10 mWh.  If the fine is $50/mWh then they owe $500.
So let’s say you own a solar system that produced 10 mWh of solar.  The utility company will ask you if you would kindly let them tell the utility that they actually produced this energy.  You being a savvy businessperson, tell them sure.  But it’s gonna cost them.  So the utility company, being savvy businesspeople themselves, offer to pay you $40 per mWh.  Cheaper for them than paying the fine and you are making money for an asset that you don’t need.  
1mWh = 1 SREC.  Price determined by state RPS and ACP.  This creates the market and price is set by RPS requirement.  Aggressive RPS = strong demand and high prices.  Weak demand = lower prices.  
Chart with DC, MD, VA, and NJ

Case Study
500 kW system DESIGN / $1,000,000 / 30% ITC  / 60% Bonus depreciation
DC $.17 kWh $435 SREC
MD - $.15/kWh - $75 SREC
VA - $.13/kWh - $35 SREC
NJ - $.22 kWh - $110/SREC


PPA What if you don't have $1,000,000 and still want solar?
PPA = Power Purchase Agreement
3rd party owns the system
takes all of the incentives
sells you the power at a discount at an agreed upon rate
rate calculated by market
rate can be fixed for 25 years

Lock in electricity costs for 25 years 
Electricity rates in the mid-atlantic have been stable for the last 10 years or so but are rising fast.  Paste Press Release for PEPCO/BGE rate increases.  
Show PPA graph with straight line 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU CAN USE ALL OF THE POWER ONSITE
What if I own a building that is triple net?  Or if the roof is big and the usage is low?  Warehouse for example
 Community Solar
This is where that third party owns the solar system, keeps all of the incentives, and sells the electricity to third party subscribers
What does this mean for you?  You receive an annual lease payment, an upfront payment, or a combination of the two.
