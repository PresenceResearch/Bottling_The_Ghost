An SREC, or Solar Renewable Energy Certificate, is a tradable credit that represents the environmental benefits of generating one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity from a solar energy system. SRECs are used in several states in the U.S. to help meet Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) or similar regulatory requirements, which mandate that a certain percentage of the electricity sold by utilities come from renewable sources.

### Key Points about SRECs:
- **Generation**: SRECs are generated by solar energy systems based on the amount of electricity they produce. For example, a solar system that generates 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity will earn one SREC.
- **Trading**: SRECs can be bought and sold on the open market. Solar system owners can sell their SRECs to utilities or other entities that need to meet renewable energy requirements.
- **Value**: The value of an SREC can vary widely depending on the supply and demand dynamics in the market, as well as state-specific regulations and incentives.
- **Revenue Stream**: For solar system owners, SRECs can provide an additional revenue stream on top of savings from reduced electricity bills.
- **Compliance**: Utilities and other electricity suppliers buy SRECs to comply with state RPS requirements, which helps drive demand for these certificates.

In summary, SRECs incentivize the generation of solar energy by providing a financial mechanism for recognizing and trading the environmental benefits of solar power.
