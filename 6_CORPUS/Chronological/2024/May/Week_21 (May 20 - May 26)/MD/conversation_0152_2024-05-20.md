The best Apple Watch complication for displaying the most accurate location is the **"Apple Maps" complication**. This complication uses Apple's robust location services to provide real-time updates on your current location. It integrates seamlessly with the watch's GPS and cellular capabilities (if available) to ensure you have the most accurate and up-to-date location information.

Additionally, third-party apps like **"Google Maps"** and **"Citymapper"** also offer complications that can be customized to show precise location details. These apps are known for their reliable location services and frequent updates, making them excellent choices for accurate location tracking on your Apple Watch.
