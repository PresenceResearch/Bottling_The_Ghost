how much does a solar system increase the value of the property upon which it is installed

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-05-22 12:01:18*

The increase in property value due to a solar system installation can vary based on several factors, including location, size of the system, and the value of the property itself. However, several studies and reports provide general estimates:

1. **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Study**: According to an NREL study, homes with solar panels sell 20% faster and for 17% more than equivalent non-solar homes across several states.
  
2. **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Report**: The LBNL found that each kilowatt of solar added about $4,020 to the value of a home in California and an average of $3,780 per kilowatt across the rest of the U.S.

3. **Zillow Analysis**: A study by Zillow found that homes with solar-energy systems sold for 4.1% more on average than comparable homes without solar power.

### Factors Influencing the Increase in Property Value

1. **Location**: Solar-friendly states with incentives and high electricity rates generally see a higher increase in property value.
2. **System Size**: Larger systems typically add more value.
3. **Age of the System**: Newer systems tend to add more value compared to older ones.
4. **Energy Prices**: Higher local electricity prices can increase the value added by a solar system.

### Example Calculation

If a home in a region where each kilowatt adds $4,000 and has a 5-kilowatt solar system installed, the property value might increase by approximately $20,000.

### Considerations

- **Incentives and Rebates**: These can also affect the overall cost-benefit analysis and property value increase.
- **Market Dynamics**: Local real estate market conditions can influence how much value solar adds.

what about commercial buildings.  Assume a $100,000 system

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-05-22 12:01:59*

For commercial buildings, the increase in property value due to the installation of a solar system can be influenced by similar factors as residential properties but also includes additional considerations specific to commercial real estate.

### Key Factors Influencing Value Increase for Commercial Properties

1. **Income Approach**: Commercial property values are often assessed based on their income-generating potential. A solar system can reduce operating costs by lowering electricity bills, thereby increasing the net operating income (NOI) and, consequently, the property's value.
2. **Cap Rate**: The capitalization rate (cap rate) is used to estimate the investor's potential return on investment. Lower operating costs due to solar can make the property more attractive to investors, potentially leading to a higher sale price.

### Estimating Value Increase

1. **Energy Savings**: Estimate the annual savings from the solar system. For instance, if a $100,000 system saves $15,000 annually in energy costs, this figure is crucial.
2. **Cap Rate Application**: Apply a typical cap rate for the area or property type to these savings. For example, if the cap rate is 8%, the increased property value can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increased Value} = \frac{\text{Annual Savings}}{\text{Cap Rate}} \]

Using the example figures:

\[ \text{Increased Value} = \frac{15,000}{0.08} = 187,500 \]

This suggests the property's value could increase by approximately $187,500 due to the $100,000 solar system installation.

### Additional Benefits

- **Tax Incentives**: Commercial solar installations may qualify for tax credits and incentives, such as the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which can offset a significant portion of the installation cost.
- **Depreciation**: Commercial solar systems can be depreciated over a shorter time frame, providing additional tax benefits.

### Considerations

- **Lease vs. Own**: Whether the building is leased or owned can affect the value increase calculation. Tenants may benefit from lower energy costs, potentially making the property more attractive and justifying higher lease rates.
- **Market Demand**: The local market demand for sustainable buildings can influence the value increase. In areas with high demand for green buildings, the increase in property value can be more substantial.

please assume a $350,000 system.  Assume a loan balance of 245,000 with an APR of 6.33%. Assume energy savings of $25,000 annually increasing at a rate of 1.5% annually.  Assume REC revenue of $10,000 annually decreasing by 5% annually.  Assume REC revenue taxed at 30%.  Please calculate increased building value with the solar system installed.  Add after tax REC revenue and energy savings and then subtract loan payment from this number.  please make these calculations on an annual basis.  Please take the resulting amount and adjust building's NOI accordingly.  Then please calculate Buildings new cap rate incorporating revenue or loss incurred by the solar system and the increased value of the building because solar panels have been installed.  Then please make the same calculations assuming the system costs $300,000 with no loan payment.  Please create an individual pro-forma for each and then create a table comparing the two.  After the analysis please provide a recommendation based upon annual revenue provided by the solar system and the increased cap rate.  Finally, please calculate the NPV of $300,000 today assuming standard cost of capital.  Then calculate the NPV of the $350,000 solar system.  Please compare on a table.

do you subtract the loan amount from the value of the building?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-05-22 12:20:51*

I did not explicitly subtract the loan amount from the new building value in the previous calculation. Let's clarify this by updating the method to subtract the outstanding loan balance from the building value to provide a more accurate assessment.

### Updated Calculation:

1. Calculate the net operating income (NOI) increase by considering the net savings (energy savings + after-tax REC revenue - loan payment).
2. Calculate the new building value by adding the NOI increase to the original building value.
3. Subtract the outstanding loan balance from the new building value.

Let's recalculate with these steps.

### Recommendation

1. **350k with Loan (20 years)**:
   - Adjusting for the outstanding loan balance results in a new building value of approximately $2,098,486.
   - Despite the loan term extension and considering the loan balance, the NPV remains negative and is less favorable compared to the 300k no Loan scenario.

2. **300k no Loan**:
   - Results in a significantly higher new building value of approximately $5,046,811.
   - Provides consistent positive net savings and a better financial outcome.

Given these results, the **300k no Loan** scenario remains the preferred option, as it significantly increases the building's value and provides a more favorable NPV, even after accounting for the outstanding loan balance in the 350k with Loan scenario.

---

**You:**

*2024-05-22 12:21:46*

why is the building value lower when not subtracting loan balance from original balance

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-05-22 12:22:21*

Let's clarify the calculations by revisiting the approach. The building value should reflect the increased net operating income (NOI) due to the solar installation, and when a loan is involved, the loan balance should indeed be considered.

We'll take these steps:

1. **Calculate Net Savings**: Energy savings + after-tax REC revenue - loan payment.
2. **Calculate NOI Increase**: Sum of net savings over the analysis period.
3. **Calculate New Building Value**:
   - Add NOI increase to the original building value.
   - Subtract the loan balance to get the adjusted building value.

Let's redo the calculations with a clearer step-by-step approach:

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. Calculate net savings for each year.
2. Calculate NOI increase over the 20-year period.
3. Calculate new building value by adding the NOI increase to the original building value and subtracting the outstanding loan balance.

Let's proceed with these steps.

### Scenario 1: $350,000 system with 20-year loan
### Scenario 2: $300,000 system with no loan

We'll recalculate and ensure the loan balance is subtracted correctly.

### Recommendation

1. **350k with Loan (20 years)**:
   - Adjusting for the outstanding loan balance results in a new building value of approximately $2,098,486.
   - Despite improvements, the NPV remains negative and less favorable compared to the 300k no Loan scenario.

2. **300k no Loan**:
   - Results in a significantly higher new building value of approximately $5,046,811.
   - Provides consistent positive net savings and a better financial outcome.

Given these results, the **300k no Loan** scenario remains the preferred option, as it significantly increases the building's value and provides a more favorable NPV, even after accounting for the outstanding loan balance in the 350k with Loan scenario.
