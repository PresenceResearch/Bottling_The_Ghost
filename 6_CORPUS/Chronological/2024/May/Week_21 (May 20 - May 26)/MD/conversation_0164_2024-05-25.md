**You:**

*2024-05-25 19:50:40*

Do you have an opinion?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-05-25 19:50:45*

I think having a few days of rain and thunderstorms at the start of the week isn't ideal, especially if you have outdoor plans for Memorial Day. However, it's great to see that the weather will clear up by mid-week, giving way to sunny and pleasant conditions. This could be a good opportunity to enjoy some outdoor activities later in the week. Just make sure to plan around the rainy start and perhaps have some indoor activities ready for Sunday and Monday. How do you feel about the upcoming weather? Any specific plans you have in mind?
