We have had discussions and they have said that the project is happening they just need to sign the agreement.  This is a solar project so there is not a lot of urgency behind it and they are very busy.  What are some strategies to get them to sign?"

            "Here are some strategies to encourage your client to sign the contract:\n\n### 1. **Set a Clear Deadline**\n   - **Communicate Urgency:** Explain any deadlines related to the project, such as financial incentives, installation schedules, or your availability. \n   - **Friendly Reminder:** Send a polite reminder email highlighting the importance of signing by a specific date to avoid delays.\n\n### 2. **Highlight Benefits of Early Signing**\n   - **Priority Scheduling:** Emphasize that signing early ensures they get priority in scheduling, which can be crucial for timely project completion.\n   - **Financial Incentives:** If applicable, remind them of any financial benefits, rebates, or incentives that may expire.\n\n### 3. **Simplify the Signing Process**\n   - **Digital Signatures:** Offer a digital signing option if you haven\u2019t already. Tools like DocuSign or Adobe Sign can make the process quick and easy.\n   - **Walkthrough Call:** Offer to schedule a brief call to go over the contract together and address any questions they might have in real-time.\n\n### 4. **Personal Follow-Up**\n   - **Phone Call:** Sometimes a direct phone call can be more effective than emails. Use the call to express your commitment to the project and your eagerness to get started.\n   - **In-Person Meeting:** If feasible, suggest a quick meeting to finalize the details and sign the contract.\n\n### 5. **Address Potential Concerns**\n   - **Identify Barriers:** Ask if there are any specific concerns or barriers preventing them from signing. Address these concerns promptly and provide reassurances where needed.\n\n### 6. **Provide Regular Updates**\n   - **Project Progress:** Keep them updated on any progress or preparatory steps you\u2019ve taken. This demonstrates your commitment and might prompt them to formalize the agreement.\n   - **Industry News:** Share relevant industry news or changes that underline the benefits of moving forward with the project.\n\n### 7. **Escalate if Necessary**\n   - **Escalate Politely:** If reminders and gentle nudges don\u2019t work, consider escalating the matter politely. Explain that you need the signed contract to allocate resources and move forward efficiently.\n   - **Alternative Options:** Mention that while you are eager to work with them, you may need to consider other projects if the agreement isn't finalized soon.\n\n### Sample Follow-Up Email\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Final Steps for Our Solar Project\n\nHi [Client's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the contract for our upcoming solar project. As we've discussed, we are all set to move forward and just need the signed agreement to kick off the next steps.\n\nSigning the contract by [specific date] will ensure we stay on track and secure your place in our project schedule. Additionally, any incentives and financial benefits available at this time can be locked in with your signature.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, I'm happy to schedule a call to walk through the contract together. Alternatively, I've included a link to sign digitally for your convenience: [Insert Digital Signature Link].\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I'm excited to start this project with you!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Contact Information]  \n[Company Name]  \n\n---\n\nThese strategies and a thoughtful approach should help you secure the signed contract from your client."
