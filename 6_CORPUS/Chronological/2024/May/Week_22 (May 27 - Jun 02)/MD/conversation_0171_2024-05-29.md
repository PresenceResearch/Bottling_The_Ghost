Calculate payback period for investment.

**Assistant:**

The payback period for the investment is 6 years. This means it takes 6 years for the cumulative cash flow to become positive, indicating that the initial investment is fully recovered within this timeframe. If you need any further analysis or information, feel free to ask!

can you give me a formula to put into excel to generate?

---

**Assistant:**

Certainly! To calculate the payback period in Excel, you can use a combination of `IF` and `MATCH` functions to find the first year when the cumulative cash flow becomes positive.

Assuming your cumulative cash flow values are in column `M` starting from row 3 (M3 for the first year's cumulative cash flow), you can use the following formula to find the payback period:

```excel
=MATCH(TRUE, M3:M1000 >= 0, 0)
```

This formula checks the range `M3:M1000` for the first instance where the cumulative cash flow is greater than or equal to zero and returns the position of that row. The result will be the year when the cumulative cash flow becomes positive, indicating the payback period.

Make sure to adjust the range `M3:M1000` to match the actual range of your cumulative cash flow data.
