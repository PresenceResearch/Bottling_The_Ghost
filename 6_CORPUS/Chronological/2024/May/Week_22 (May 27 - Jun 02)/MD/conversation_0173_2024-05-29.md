The white powder on the leaves of your ponytail palm is likely caused by a pest infestation, such as mealybugs or powdery mildew. Here are some steps you can take to address it:

1. **Inspect the Plant:** Check the leaves, stems, and soil for signs of pests or mold.

2. **Isolate the Plant:** If you have other plants nearby, isolate the affected plant to prevent the spread of pests or disease.

3. **Clean the Leaves:** Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove the white powder. You can also use a mild soap solution (a few drops of dish soap in a quart of water) to clean the leaves.

4. **Treat with Insecticide:** If you suspect mealybugs, use an insecticidal soap or neem oil spray. Follow the instructions on the product label for the best results.

5. **Improve Air Circulation:** Ensure good air circulation around the plant to reduce humidity, which can help prevent mold and mildew.

6. **Monitor and Repeat:** Keep an eye on the plant and repeat treatments as necessary until the problem is resolved.

If the problem persists or worsens, consider consulting a professional or bringing a sample to your local garden center for more specific advice.
