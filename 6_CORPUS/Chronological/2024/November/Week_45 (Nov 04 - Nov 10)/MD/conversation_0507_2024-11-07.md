To manage large datasets in Google Sheets more effectively, you can **group rows or columns**. This feature allows you to collapse and expand sections of your spreadsheet, making it easier to focus on specific data without being overwhelmed by the entire dataset.

**Here's how to group rows:**

1. **Select the Rows:**
   - Click and drag over the row numbers on the left to highlight the rows you want to group.

2. **Group the Rows:**
   - Right-click on the highlighted rows.
   - From the context menu, choose **"Group rows X–Y"**, where X and Y represent the first and last rows of your selection.

3. **Collapse or Expand the Group:**
   - A small minus sign (–) will appear next to the row numbers.
   - Click the minus sign to collapse the group, hiding the rows.
   - Click the plus sign (+) that replaces it to expand the group and reveal the rows.

**For grouping columns:**

1. **Select the Columns:**
   - Click and drag over the column letters at the top to highlight the columns you want to group.

2. **Group the Columns:**
   - Right-click on the highlighted columns.
   - Choose **"Group columns X–Y"** from the context menu.

3. **Collapse or Expand the Group:**
   - A minus sign (–) will appear above the column letters.
   - Click it to collapse the group, hiding the columns.
   - Click the plus sign (+) to expand and reveal the columns.

This method is particularly useful for organizing data, such as grouping sales figures by quarter or customer information by region. It helps in maintaining a clean and navigable spreadsheet, especially when dealing with extensive data.
