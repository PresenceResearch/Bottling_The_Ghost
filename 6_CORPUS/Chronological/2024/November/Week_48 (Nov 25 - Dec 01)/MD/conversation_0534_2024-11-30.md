### Title: Bennett Schmidt and the Dinosaur Adventure  
### Style, Genre, and Type: Epic Ballad, Folk Rock

---

[Intro]  
Bennett walks where the wild winds blow,  
Through ancient lands where the dinosaurs go.  
His heart beats strong, a hero untamed,  
With his scorpion necklace and a legend proclaimed.  

---

[Verse 1]  
Bennett loves the mighty T. rex, tall,  
The gentle Brachiosaurus standing so small.  
Triceratops with its horns of three,  
Velociraptor, fast and free.  

He dreams of Ankylosaurus, armored and tough,  
Spinosaurus swimming when the waters get rough.  
Diplodocus stretching to the tallest tree,  
Stegosaurus with plates for the world to see.  

Corythosaurus, Parasaurolophus too,  
The fierce Allosaurus chasing through the blue.  
Iguanodon with its thumbs so grand,  
Carnotaurus ruling the desert sand.  

Pachycephalosaurus with a head so thick,  
Pteranodon soaring with its aerial trick.  

---

[Chorus]  
Bennett loves them, one and all,  
Big or small, they heed his call.  
Through time and space, they walk as friends,  
On a journey where the past never ends.  

---

[Verse 2: The Magical Necklace]  
Around his neck, a scorpion's grace,  
A charm of power, its rightful place.  
It shields him from evil, its glow a guide,  
A guardian force by his heart's side.  

But beware, for the curse is true,  
He cannot take it off, no matter the view.  
For if he does, the darkness will rise,  
And shadows will flood the starlit skies.  

---

[Bridge]  
Through the fossil fields and valleys wide,  
Bennett roams with his dino pride.  
Protected and bold, he'll always explore,  
A timeless hero forevermore.  

---

[Chorus]  
Bennett loves them, one and all,  
Big or small, they heed his call.  
Through time and space, they walk as friends,  
On a journey where the past never ends.  

---

[Outro]  
So let the scorpion necklace shine,  
And the dinosaurs march through space and time.  
Bennett Schmidt, a legend of old,  
With tales of adventure forever retold.  

[End]
