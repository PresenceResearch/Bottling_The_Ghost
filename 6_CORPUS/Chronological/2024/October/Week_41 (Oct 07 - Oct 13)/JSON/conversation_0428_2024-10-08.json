This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS).

In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year.

Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline.

          "domain": "washingtoncitypaper.com",
          "text": "\nBut the upshot is relatively simple: Bowser\u2019s team was so desperate to avoid tougher choices during budget season (like making deep program cuts or \u301084\u2020raising additional taxes\u3011) that it gobbled up any money it could, consequences be damned.\n\n\u201cThe mayor wants to take money meant to help D.C.\u2019s most vulnerable families lower their utility bills and instead use it to pay her own utility bills,\u201d argues Mark Rodeffer, political chair of the Sierra Club\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\nSo, how is that happening? This is where things start to get a bit tricky.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the SETF, a fund seeded by small fees on D.C. residents\u2019 gas and electric bills. The fund should sit at about $17.6 million for the coming fiscal year, and then climb up to $26 million annually: quite a chunk of change in a year when the chief financial officer is \u301085\u2020demanding\u3011 hundreds of millions in contributions to replenish the city\u2019s reserve funds.\u00a0\n\nThe SETF is \u301086\u2020meant to pay for things\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 such as the city\u2019s \u201c\u301087\u2020Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011,\u201d which finances all manner of energy-efficient upgrades and green redevelopment projects. And, crucially, it\u2019s set to grow in size after the Council \u301088\u2020bumped up fees last year\u3011 to pay for Allen\u2019s Healthy Homes Act, legislation designed to help low-income households swap out gas appliances for electric alternatives.\u00a0\n\nBut it proved just too tempting of a target for Bowser, and she diverted the money to pay, primarily, for electric bills from the Department of General Services, which manages local government buildings and offices. This move would not only gut Healthy Homes before it even launches, but would also devastate the Green Bank. Trisha Miller, the bank\u2019s CEO, told Allen\u2019s Committee last week that the change threatens a dozen projects across the city representing a combined $250 million in public and private investments. That includes up to 640 units of affordable housing supported by this financing.\n\nIn a briefing ahead of the budget\u2019s release, Bowser\u2019s deputies told reporters that this change was necessary to keep up with the city\u2019s rising energy costs. They believe that the District\u2019s \u301089\u2020renewable energy standards\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 for major buildings, however well-intentioned, are escalating costs faster than they\u2019d anticipated. These standards specify things like how much energy buildings should use or what percentage of renewable energy they should rely on. This diverted SETF money will fund upgrades to make government buildings more efficient, according to a Bowser official who requested anonymity to discuss the budget deliberations, which is in keeping with the fund\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d of \u201callowing the city to become more environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur energy costs will have more than doubled by the end of this financial plan [in 2028] because of the practices in place,\u201d Jenny Reed, Bowser\u2019s budget director, told the Council at an April 3 meeting unveiling the budget. \u201cWe have to look at ways to continue to pay our energy bills without having to go back on some of the goals we set out for ourselves for the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s incoherent rambling with no basis in fact whatsoever,\u201d Rodeffer said when LL recounted the administration\u2019s explanation to him. He called it \u201ctotal fiction\u201d that renewable energy standards are increasing costs so dramatically, when they\u2019ve had only incremental impacts on the city. Rodeffer says the renewable energy standards account \u201cfor something like half a penny of the 15 cents per kilowatt hour electricity costs in D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s spin from a mayor who doesn\u2019t care about lowering utility bills for D.C. families,\u201d he adds. The goal of the Healthy Homes bill, which the Council unanimously passed into law Tuesday after months of \u301088\u2020lobbying from the utility companies\u3011, is to help people save money on these bills by \u301090\u2020moving away from gas appliances\u2020dcist.com\u3011.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBowser\u2019s team has tried to frame Healthy Homes as a program that hasn\u2019t launched yet, and is therefore better suited for a funding cut than the city\u2019s ongoing energy needs. Most gallingly to Allen and his allies, she\u2019s repeatedly bashed the increase on utility bills to fund the program as an unnecessary burden on ratepayers: Her own plan, of course, leaves the increase untouched, and just uses the money for a different purpose.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI also just want to say on behalf of ratepayers, because I am one, I didn\u2019t sign up for an increase in my utility rates last year, but it was imposed, and it wasn\u2019t discussed how those increased rates would be used,\u201d Bowser chided the Council at the April 3 meeting. LL finds it puzzling, then, to see Herroner\u2019s literal signature on last year\u2019s \u301091\u2020budget legislation\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 authorizing the change.\n\nIronically, Bowser\u2019s budget actions will actually increase the city\u2019s electricity bills rather than lower them, which is part of the reason why she\u2019s raiding the SETF in the first place. In a move that is somehow even more convoluted than the SETF maneuver, the administration\u2019s budget team found a way to move renewable energy funding into its general fund to cover gaps throughout the spending plan.\n\nThat brings LL to the REDF, a stand-alone pot of money administered by the Department of Energy and the Environment to \u301092\u2020pay for a variety of clean energy projects\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 in the city, particularly the development of residential solar power and energy efficiency upgrades on large commercial buildings. This money can\u2019t be used for any other purpose and is statutorily required to be kept separate from the city\u2019s general fund, per language meant to guard against politicians with wandering",

                "title": "Bowser\u2019s Budget Gimmicks Could Derail D.C.\u2019s Clean Energy Programs. Can the Council Block Them? - Washington City Paper",
                "url": "https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/694421/bowsers-budget-gimmicks-could-cripple-d-c-s-clean-energy-programs-can-the-council-block-them/",
                "text": "\nBut the upshot is relatively simple: Bowser\u2019s team was so desperate to avoid tougher choices during budget season (like making deep program cuts or \u301084\u2020raising additional taxes\u3011) that it gobbled up any money it could, consequences be damned.\n\n\u201cThe mayor wants to take money meant to help D.C.\u2019s most vulnerable families lower their utility bills and instead use it to pay her own utility bills,\u201d argues Mark Rodeffer, political chair of the Sierra Club\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\nSo, how is that happening? This is where things start to get a bit tricky.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the SETF, a fund seeded by small fees on D.C. residents\u2019 gas and electric bills. The fund should sit at about $17.6 million for the coming fiscal year, and then climb up to $26 million annually: quite a chunk of change in a year when the chief financial officer is \u301085\u2020demanding\u3011 hundreds of millions in contributions to replenish the city\u2019s reserve funds.\u00a0\n\nThe SETF is \u301086\u2020meant to pay for things\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 such as the city\u2019s \u201c\u301087\u2020Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011,\u201d which finances all manner of energy-efficient upgrades and green redevelopment projects. And, crucially, it\u2019s set to grow in size after the Council \u301088\u2020bumped up fees last year\u3011 to pay for Allen\u2019s Healthy Homes Act, legislation designed to help low-income households swap out gas appliances for electric alternatives.\u00a0\n\nBut it proved just too tempting of a target for Bowser, and she diverted the money to pay, primarily, for electric bills from the Department of General Services, which manages local government buildings and offices. This move would not only gut Healthy Homes before it even launches, but would also devastate the Green Bank. Trisha Miller, the bank\u2019s CEO, told Allen\u2019s Committee last week that the change threatens a dozen projects across the city representing a combined $250 million in public and private investments. That includes up to 640 units of affordable housing supported by this financing.\n\nIn a briefing ahead of the budget\u2019s release, Bowser\u2019s deputies told reporters that this change was necessary to keep up with the city\u2019s rising energy costs. They believe that the District\u2019s \u301089\u2020renewable energy standards\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 for major buildings, however well-intentioned, are escalating costs faster than they\u2019d anticipated. These standards specify things like how much energy buildings should use or what percentage of renewable energy they should rely on. This diverted SETF money will fund upgrades to make government buildings more efficient, according to a Bowser official who requested anonymity to discuss the budget deliberations, which is in keeping with the fund\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d of \u201callowing the city to become more environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur energy costs will have more than doubled by the end of this financial plan [in 2028] because of the practices in place,\u201d Jenny Reed, Bowser\u2019s budget director, told the Council at an April 3 meeting unveiling the budget. \u201cWe have to look at ways to continue to pay our energy bills without having to go back on some of the goals we set out for ourselves for the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s incoherent rambling with no basis in fact whatsoever,\u201d Rodeffer said when LL recounted the administration\u2019s explanation to him. He called it \u201ctotal fiction\u201d that renewable energy standards are increasing costs so dramatically, when they\u2019ve had only incremental impacts on the city. Rodeffer says the renewable energy standards account \u201cfor something like half a penny of the 15 cents per kilowatt hour electricity costs in D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s spin from a mayor who doesn\u2019t care about lowering utility bills for D.C. families,\u201d he adds. The goal of the Healthy Homes bill, which the Council unanimously passed into law Tuesday after months of \u301088\u2020lobbying from the utility companies\u3011, is to help people save money on these bills by \u301090\u2020moving away from gas appliances\u2020dcist.com\u3011.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBowser\u2019s team has tried to frame Healthy Homes as a program that hasn\u2019t launched yet, and is therefore better suited for a funding cut than the city\u2019s ongoing energy needs. Most gallingly to Allen and his allies, she\u2019s repeatedly bashed the increase on utility bills to fund the program as an unnecessary burden on ratepayers: Her own plan, of course, leaves the increase untouched, and just uses the money for a different purpose.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI also just want to say on behalf of ratepayers, because I am one, I didn\u2019t sign up for an increase in my utility rates last year, but it was imposed, and it wasn\u2019t discussed how those increased rates would be used,\u201d Bowser chided the Council at the April 3 meeting. LL finds it puzzling, then, to see Herroner\u2019s literal signature on last year\u2019s \u301091\u2020budget legislation\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 authorizing the change.\n\nIronically, Bowser\u2019s budget actions will actually increase the city\u2019s electricity bills rather than lower them, which is part of the reason why she\u2019s raiding the SETF in the first place. In a move that is somehow even more convoluted than the SETF maneuver, the administration\u2019s budget team found a way to move renewable energy funding into its general fund to cover gaps throughout the spending plan.\n\nThat brings LL to the REDF, a stand-alone pot of money administered by the Department of Energy and the Environment to \u301092\u2020pay for a variety of clean energy projects\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 in the city, particularly the development of residential solar power and energy efficiency upgrades on large commercial buildings. This money can\u2019t be used for any other purpose and is statutorily required to be kept separate from the city\u2019s general fund, per language meant to guard against politicians with wandering",

          "text": "\nNext, we oppose the proposal to greatly expand the list of exemptions that could be applied to individual projects by the Green Building Advisory Council and DOEE. Based on the short description in the Fiscal Impact Statement, these exemptions would create a Swiss cheese of holes in the Greener Government Buildings Act. Finally, we are deeply concerned by a proposal that could perpetuate the use of fossil fuel appliances in District buildings. \n\nGoing forward, net zero construction should be the norm for DC government buildings to reduce energy costs, improve indoor and outdoor air quality, and combat the climate crisis. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). In fact, some legislative proposals on amending BEPS have already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and they should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the DC Council to drop this section from the Budget Support Act. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget.\n\nThe Building Energy Performance Standards, enacted by the DC Council in 2018, form an essential cornerstone of DC\u2019s climate and clean energy policies. BEPS will increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from large buildings in the District. Sierra Club continues to be deeply concerned that DGS and the mayor are not committed to the required retrofits to DGS buildings to comply with BEPS. As the old saying goes, this approach is \u201cpenny-wise and pound foolish.\u201d Over time, improving energy efficiency reduces DGS\u2019s operating budget and saves money for DC taxpayers.\n\nRecognizing the difficulty of funding improvements to building energy efficiency in a time of tight budgets, we again put forward a cost-effective solution: Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs). These contracts are a mechanism used to pay for today\u2019s facility upgrades with tomorrow's energy savings \u2013 without tapping the DGS capital budget. An ESPC is a partnership between an energy service company (ESCO) and a facility owner such as DGS. The ESCO designs and installs energy savings measures. Savings are monitored and verified, and the facility owner reimburses the ESCO over a certain number of years out of operating budgets.[2] \n\nWe have heard a concern that the District\u2019s Anti-Deficiency Act could stand in the way of DGS entering into energy savings performance contracts. This law prevents the District government from entering into a contract for the payment of money before an appropriation is made, unless authorized by law. The federal Anti-Deficiency Act includes an exemption so that the federal government can enter into energy savings performance contracts. If an exemption is needed, the DC Council could enact a similar exemption. We ask the committee to consider adding such an exemption to this year\u2019s budget legislation.[3]\n\nBudget Gimmick using RPS/REDF\n\nThere\u2019s an odd and very concerning maneuver described on p. 32-33 of the Fiscal Impact Statement. It would require several actions which could result in reduced resources in the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF), undercutting the Solar for All program. It could also place downward pressure on the value of Solar Renewable Energy Credits in the District. \n\nAs we understand it, companies supplying electricity to the DC government could comply with the District\u2019s renewable energy requirements (Renewable Portfolio Standard) by paying alternative compliance payments rather than purchasing renewable energy credits. The RPS law directs alternative compliance payments into the Renewable Energy Development Fund, which is managed by the Department of Energy and the Environment and used to support the Solar for All program among other activities. An amount of funding equivalent to the alternative compliance payments from these energy suppliers would then be transferred to the general fund. It appears to be a budget gimmick designed to siphon money from the REDF to the general fund for years to come. \n\nDC Archives Building\n\nAs we have stated on multiple occasions, the new DC Archives building should comply with the Greener Government Buildings Act. The building should be constructed to net zero energy standards, include no fossil fuel combustion, and obtain electricity from on-site renewable energy sources and off-site renewable energy power purchase agreements. We have heard that DGS is now proposing to use electric resistance heating rather than gas boilers. This is a bad and costly idea because electric heat pumps are much more efficient. \n\nZero Waste\n\nThe mayor\u2019s transmittal letter of the Fiscal Year 2025 (FY2025) Proposed Budget and Financial Plan said she was building a budget on three pillars: \u301033\u2020public schools (\u2020app.box.com\u3011\u301033\u2020emphasis added)\u2020app.box.com\u3011\u301033\u2020,\u2020app.box.com\u3011\u301033\u2020 public safety, and Downtown\u2020app.box.com\u3011. As we testified in the February Performance Oversight Hearing, DGS, as the agency responsible for managing waste in both DC Public Schools buildings and District government managed and occupied buildings, needs to step up to contribute to DC\u2019s Zero Waste goals. \n\nAction 37 of the \u301034\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011, released by the mayor on February 8, establishes \u201cZero Waste Schools\u201d to be accomplished between 2023 and 2028. Action 37 calls for hands-on learning about zero waste practices and ensuring that school cafeterias instill best practices on food waste reduction, donation, and composting. Hands-on learning and best practices can only be taught if composting services are provided to public schools.",

            "The current state of Washington, D.C.'s solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) is directly impacted by Mayor Bowser's recent budget decisions. A key issue is that the Mayor's 2024 fiscal plan involves diverting funds from critical renewable energy programs, including the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF), which is crucial for supporting solar initiatives like the *Solar for All* program. This diversion could reduce the value of SRECs, as the city government may shift from purchasing renewable energy credits to paying alternative compliance payments, which funnel less money into supporting local solar projects.\n\nThis has sparked concerns from environmental advocates, as reducing demand for SRECs would lead to a drop in their value, potentially extending the payback period for solar owners and discouraging new solar investments in D.C. Additionally, this budget maneuver could negatively affect ongoing projects aimed at improving energy efficiency in government buildings and maintaining the city's renewable energy goals\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30107\u2020source\u3011. \n\nThese budgetary actions have raised alarms about the long-term sustainability of D.C.'s clean energy transition, particularly as they may impact vulnerable communities that benefit from solar energy cost reductions\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011."

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants",

And, crucially, it\u2019s set to grow in size after the Council \u301088\u2020bumped up fees last year\u3011 to pay for Allen\u2019s Healthy Homes Act, legislation designed to help low-income households swap out gas appliances for electric alternatives.\u00a0\n\nBut it proved just too tempting of a target for Bowser, and she diverted the money to pay, primarily, for electric bills from the Department of General Services, which manages local government buildings and offices. This move would not only gut Healthy Homes before it even launches, but would also devastate the Green Bank. Trisha Miller, the bank\u2019s CEO, told Allen\u2019s Committee last week that the change threatens a dozen projects across the city representing a combined $250 million in public and private investments. That includes up to 640 units of affordable housing supported by this financing.\n\nIn a briefing ahead of the budget\u2019s release, Bowser\u2019s deputies told reporters that this change was necessary to keep up with the city\u2019s rising energy costs. They believe that the District\u2019s \u301089\u2020renewable energy standards\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 for major buildings, however well-intentioned, are escalating costs faster than they\u2019d anticipated. These standards specify things like how much energy buildings should use or what percentage of renewable energy they should rely on. This diverted SETF money will fund upgrades to make government buildings more efficient, according to a Bowser official who requested anonymity to discuss the budget deliberations, which is in keeping with the fund\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d of \u201callowing the city to become more environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur energy costs will have more than doubled by the end of this financial plan [in 2028] because of the practices in place,\u201d Jenny Reed, Bowser\u2019s budget director, told the Council at an April 3 meeting unveiling the budget. \u201cWe have to look at ways to continue to pay our energy bills without having to go back on some of the goals we set out for ourselves for the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s incoherent rambling with no basis in fact whatsoever,\u201d Rodeffer said when LL recounted the administration\u2019s explanation to him. He called it \u201ctotal fiction\u201d that renewable energy standards are increasing costs so dramatically, when they\u2019ve had only incremental impacts on the city. Rodeffer says the renewable energy standards account \u201cfor something like half a penny of the 15 cents per kilowatt hour electricity costs in D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s spin from a mayor who doesn\u2019t care about lowering utility bills for D.C. families,\u201d he adds. The goal of the Healthy Homes bill, which the Council unanimously passed into law Tuesday after months of \u301088\u2020lobbying from the utility companies\u3011, is to help people save money on these bills by \u301090\u2020moving away from gas appliances\u2020dcist.com\u3011.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBowser\u2019s team has tried to frame Healthy Homes as a program that hasn\u2019t launched yet, and is therefore better suited for a funding cut than the city\u2019s ongoing energy needs. Most gallingly to Allen and his allies, she\u2019s repeatedly bashed the increase on utility bills to fund the program as an unnecessary burden on ratepayers: Her own plan, of course, leaves the increase untouched, and just uses the money for a different purpose.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI also just want to say on behalf of ratepayers, because I am one, I didn\u2019t sign up for an increase in my utility rates last year, but it was imposed, and it wasn\u2019t discussed how those increased rates would be used,\u201d Bowser chided the Council at the April 3 meeting. LL finds it puzzling, then, to see Herroner\u2019s literal signature on last year\u2019s \u301091\u2020budget legislation\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 authorizing the change.\n\nIronically, Bowser\u2019s budget actions will actually increase the city\u2019s electricity bills rather than lower them, which is part of the reason why she\u2019s raiding the SETF in the first place. In a move that is somehow even more convoluted than the SETF maneuver, the administration\u2019s budget team found a way to move renewable energy funding into its general fund to cover gaps throughout the spending plan.\n\nThat brings LL to the REDF, a stand-alone pot of money administered by the Department of Energy and the Environment to \u301092\u2020pay for a variety of clean energy projects\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 in the city, particularly the development of residential solar power and energy efficiency upgrades on large commercial buildings. This money can\u2019t be used for any other purpose and is statutorily required to be kept separate from the city\u2019s general fund, per language meant to guard against politicians with wandering",

Under the RPS, electricity suppliers must buy 100% of their power from renewable sources by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar power by 2041 (\u301046\u2020Local Solar Expansion Act of 2022\u2020code.dccouncil.gov\u3011). Through the RPS, the District can avoid a substantial portion of its projected 2032 GHG emissions. However, a key issue here will be to ensure that while more renewable energy is being added to the District\u2019s energy mix, electricity rates remain affordable for both District businesses and residents.\n\nIn addition to the RPS, the CEDC Plan lays out other strategies for increasing local renewable energy generation, and encourages the development of innovative neighborhood-scale energy resources within the District.\n\nInitiatives\n\n  * \u301047\u2020Buy Green Power\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Clean Energy DC\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Solar Initiatives\u3011\u00a0  \n- \u301050\u2020Solar for All\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Sustainable DC\u2020www.sustainabledc.org\u3011\n  * \u301052\u2020Public Service Commission PowerPath DC\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nResources and Background\n\n  * \u301053\u2020Renewable Portfolio Standard FAQs\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020PSC Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nEducation\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Electric Vehicle Grand Prix\u3011\n\nContact TTY:\u00a0\n\n711 \n\nRelated Content:\u00a0\n\n\u301010\u2020Energy in the District\u3011\n\n  * \u301056\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301060\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301061\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301062\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: (202) 535-2881  \nTTY: (800) 855-1000  \nEmail: \u301063\u2020[email protected]\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020Ask the Director\u2020dcforms.dc.gov\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020Agency Performance\u2020oca.dc.gov\u3011\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Accessibility\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Privacy & Security\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020About DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020Terms & Conditions\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 4: DOEE's Facebook page][Ima",

              "snippet": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants"

              "pub_date": null,
              "snippet": "\nBut the upshot is relatively simple: Bowser\u2019s team was so desperate to avoid tougher choices during budget season (like making deep program cuts or \u301084\u2020raising additional taxes\u3011) that it gobbled up any money it could, consequences be damned.\n\n\u201cThe mayor wants to take money meant to help D.C.\u2019s most vulnerable families lower their utility bills and instead use it to pay her own utility bills,\u201d argues Mark Rodeffer, political chair of the Sierra Club\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\nSo, how is that happening? This is where things start to get a bit tricky.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the SETF, a fund seeded by small fees on D.C. residents\u2019 gas and electric bills. The fund should sit at about $17.6 million for the coming fiscal year, and then climb up to $26 million annually: quite a chunk of change in a year when the chief financial officer is \u301085\u2020demanding\u3011 hundreds of millions in contributions to replenish the city\u2019s reserve funds.\u00a0\n\nThe SETF is \u301086\u2020meant to pay for things\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 such as the city\u2019s \u201c\u301087\u2020Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011,\u201d which finances all manner of energy-efficient upgrades and green redevelopment projects. And, crucially, it\u2019s set to grow in size after the Council \u301088\u2020bumped up fees last year\u3011 to pay for Allen\u2019s Healthy Homes Act, legislation designed to help low-income households swap out gas appliances for electric alternatives.\u00a0\n\nBut it proved just too tempting of a target for Bowser, and she diverted the money to pay, primarily, for electric bills from the Department of General Services, which manages local government buildings and offices. This move would not only gut Healthy Homes before it even launches, but would also devastate the Green Bank. Trisha Miller, the bank\u2019s CEO, told Allen\u2019s Committee last week that the change threatens a dozen projects across the city representing a combined $250 million in public and private investments. That includes up to 640 units of affordable housing supported by this financing.\n\nIn a briefing ahead of the budget\u2019s release, Bowser\u2019s deputies told reporters that this change was necessary to keep up with the city\u2019s rising energy costs. They believe that the District\u2019s \u301089\u2020renewable energy standards\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 for major buildings, however well-intentioned, are escalating costs faster than they\u2019d anticipated. These standards specify things like how much energy buildings should use or what percentage of renewable energy they should rely on. This diverted SETF money will fund upgrades to make government buildings more efficient, according to a Bowser official who requested anonymity to discuss the budget deliberations, which is in keeping with the fund\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d of \u201callowing the city to become more environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur energy costs will have more than doubled by the end of this financial plan [in 2028] because of the practices in place,\u201d Jenny Reed, Bowser\u2019s budget director, told the Council at an April 3 meeting unveiling the budget. \u201cWe have to look at ways to continue to pay our energy bills without having to go back on some of the goals we set out for ourselves for the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s incoherent rambling with no basis in fact whatsoever,\u201d Rodeffer said when LL recounted the administration\u2019s explanation to him. He called it \u201ctotal fiction\u201d that renewable energy standards are increasing costs so dramatically, when they\u2019ve had only incremental impacts on the city. Rodeffer says the renewable energy standards account \u201cfor something like half a penny of the 15 cents per kilowatt hour electricity costs in D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s spin from a mayor who doesn\u2019t care about lowering utility bills for D.C. families,\u201d he adds. The goal of the Healthy Homes bill, which the Council unanimously passed into law Tuesday after months of \u301088\u2020lobbying from the utility companies\u3011, is to help people save money on these bills by \u301090\u2020moving away from gas appliances\u2020dcist.com\u3011.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBowser\u2019s team has tried to frame Healthy Homes as a program that hasn\u2019t launched yet, and is therefore better suited for a funding cut than the city\u2019s ongoing energy needs. Most gallingly to Allen and his allies, she\u2019s repeatedly bashed the increase on utility bills to fund the program as an unnecessary burden on ratepayers: Her own plan, of course, leaves the increase untouched, and just uses the money for a different purpose.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI also just want to say on behalf of ratepayers, because I am one, I didn\u2019t sign up for an increase in my utility rates last year, but it was imposed, and it wasn\u2019t discussed how those increased rates would be used,\u201d Bowser chided the Council at the April 3 meeting. LL finds it puzzling, then, to see Herroner\u2019s literal signature on last year\u2019s \u301091\u2020budget legislation\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 authorizing the change.\n\nIronically, Bowser\u2019s budget actions will actually increase the city\u2019s electricity bills rather than lower them, which is part of the reason why she\u2019s raiding the SETF in the first place. In a move that is somehow even more convoluted than the SETF maneuver, the administration\u2019s budget team found a way to move renewable energy funding into its general fund to cover gaps throughout the spending plan.\n\nThat brings LL to the REDF, a stand-alone pot of money administered by the Department of Energy and the Environment to \u301092\u2020pay for a variety of clean energy projects\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 in the city, particularly the development of residential solar power and energy efficiency upgrades on large commercial buildings. This money can\u2019t be used for any other purpose and is statutorily required to be kept separate from the city\u2019s general fund, per language meant to guard against politicians with wandering"

Under the RPS, electricity suppliers must buy 100% of their power from renewable sources by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar power by 2041 (\u301046\u2020Local Solar Expansion Act of 2022\u2020code.dccouncil.gov\u3011). Through the RPS, the District can avoid a substantial portion of its projected 2032 GHG emissions. However, a key issue here will be to ensure that while more renewable energy is being added to the District\u2019s energy mix, electricity rates remain affordable for both District businesses and residents.\n\nIn addition to the RPS, the CEDC Plan lays out other strategies for increasing local renewable energy generation, and encourages the development of innovative neighborhood-scale energy resources within the District.\n\nInitiatives\n\n  * \u301047\u2020Buy Green Power\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Clean Energy DC\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Solar Initiatives\u3011\u00a0  \n- \u301050\u2020Solar for All\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Sustainable DC\u2020www.sustainabledc.org\u3011\n  * \u301052\u2020Public Service Commission PowerPath DC\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nResources and Background\n\n  * \u301053\u2020Renewable Portfolio Standard FAQs\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020PSC Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nEducation\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Electric Vehicle Grand Prix\u3011\n\nContact TTY:\u00a0\n\n711 \n\nRelated Content:\u00a0\n\n\u301010\u2020Energy in the District\u3011\n\n  * \u301056\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301060\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301061\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301062\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: (202) 535-2881  \nTTY: (800) 855-1000  \nEmail: \u301063\u2020[email protected]\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020Ask the Director\u2020dcforms.dc.gov\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020Agency Performance\u2020oca.dc.gov\u3011\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Accessibility\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Privacy & Security\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020About DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020Terms & Conditions\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 4: DOEE's Facebook page][Ima"

          "text": "\nIn a new measure, any surplus revenue the District has at the end of this year will be spent on benefits and relief for excluded workers, though such a surplus is unlikely. Finally, the council voted to add an additional $33 million in newly available federal funding to the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) for this year, but it\u2019s not yet clear when applications will reopen.\u00a0\n\nTwo weeks ago, the council voted on the 2024 budget for the first time, restoring money for ERAP, legal services for people facing eviction, survivors of domestic violence and homeless services. The council also added money for 230 new Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) vouchers \u2014 Bowser had not funded any.\u00a0\n\nBut advocates and some councilmembers pushed for more funding for some programs, including food access and PSH vouchers. The Way Home Campaign, a group of organizations that advocate for ending homelessness, supports an additional 1,500 vouchers.\u00a0\n\nAt the May 30 meeting, Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George introduced an amendment that would require any additional money D.C. has at the end of 2023 to be distributed to people who are on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and people who did not receive unemployment benefits during the Covid-19 emergency.\u00a0\n\nThe amendment calls for the first $39 million of unexpected funds to be used to fund the G\u30103\u2020ive SNAP a Raise Act\u2020www.google.com\u3011, which would provide a local SNAP benefit to supplement federal benefits. People who are already on SNAP would receive the extra benefit from Jan. 2024 through Sept. 2024, which increases the household\u2019s monthly benefit by up to 10%. District residents who are on SNAP currently receive about $6 a day, on average, and may still be adjusting from a decrease in SNAP benefits paired with the end of the pandemic.\u00a0\n\n\u2018We have neighbors whose monthly SNAP benefits are now reduced to double and single digits,\u201d Lewis George said. \u201cWe can make the difference for these residents.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe next $20 million would be distributed to people who were excluded from receiving local and federal pandemic assistance. D.C. initially approved a benefit for excluded workers last year, but the money was never distributed, and the mayor\u2019s proposed budget for 2024 cut funding for the measure. Last year, the council estimated the money could provide a $1,000 check to about 15,000 excluded workers. Dozens of excluded workers testified throughout the budget process, calling for the money to be restored.\u00a0\n\nThe amendment passed unanimously, but Council Chair Phil Mendelson warned it was unlikely D.C. would actually have the surplus to implement it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is generally a feeling that the chances of our revenue growing to this magnitude is slim,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks should not walk away from here saying ah, we have funded SNAP.\u201d\u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nIssues |\u30104\u2020DC Budget\u3011|\u30105\u2020Social Services\u3011 \n\n* * *\n\nRegion |\u30106\u2020Washington DC\u3011 \n\n[Image 2]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Image 3]\n\nemail updates\n\nWe believe ending homelessness begins with listening to the stories of those who have experienced it.\n\n\u30107\u2020 Subscribe\u2020eepurl.com\u3011 \n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u30108\u2020 MLK Library bans sleeping outside building, threatening a refuge for people experiencing homelessness Franziska Wild \u3011 \n\n\u30109\u2020 District residents are going months without their SNAP benefits Samantha Monteiro \u3011 \n\n\u301010\u2020 Money isn\u2019t enough: How the Child Tax Credit can restore hope for D.C. families Khadijah Williams \u3011 \n\n\u301011\u2020 The 2025 D.C. budget funds over 600 new vouchers, but homeless advocacy groups say it won\u2019t be enough Donte Kirby \u3011 \n\n [Image 4]\n\n [Image 5]\n\n [Image 6]\n\n [Image 7]\n\n [Image 8]\n\n [Image 9]\n\n [Image 10]\n\n\u301012\u20201317 G Street NW, Washington D.C. 20005\u3011 | \u301013\u2020202.347.2006\u2020tel:2023472006\u3011 | \u301014\u2020Staff Directory\u3011  \nMonday - Friday, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. | Federal Schedule (\u301015\u2020check operating status\u2020www.opm.gov\u3011)\n\n\u00a92024 Street Sense Media | Advertise With Us | Newsroom Ethics and Standards | Member: International Network of Street Papers\n\n[Image 11]\n\nSearch\n\n[Image 12]\n\n  * ARTICLES\n  * \u30101\u2020News\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Opinion\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Art\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Obituaries & Memorials\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Artist/Vendor Profiles\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Print Editions\u2020issuu.com\u3011\n  * \u301021\u2020Write for Us\u3011\n\n  * GET INVOLVED\n  * \u301022\u2020Donate\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Connect\u3011\n  * \u301024\u2020Download Our App\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Volunteer Opportunities\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Intern\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Advertise\u3011\n  * \u301028\u2020Jobs\u3011\n  * \u301029\u2020Events\u3011\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * \u301030\u2020Mission and History\u3011\n  * \u301031\u2020Finances\u3011\n  * \u301032\u2020Ethics and Policies\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Press Room\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n\n  * OUR TEAM\n  * \u301034\u2020Artist/Vendors\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Artists-in-Residence\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Staff\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Interns\u3011\n  * \u301037\u2020Volunteers\u3011\n  * \u3010",

Following the Council\u2019s vote, the Mayor released the following statement:\n\n\u201cI thank the Council, our budget teams, as well as our agency directors and their teams for all the work that has gone into delivering a budget our community can be proud of and that invests in the future of DC. The fiscal constraints of waning federal dollars combined with increased costs and the prolonged impacts of telework, including reduced commercial property tax revenues, created the most challenging budget in more than a decade. Over the years, our prosperity has allowed us to weather difficult moments while investing in a fair shot for all DC residents. This year, our focus was on preserving our robust social services and ensuring we can build on them for years to come. I\u2019m proud that this budget allows us to move big ideas forward to ensure a strong comeback.\n\n\u201cThis is a budget that reflects what we know to be true about the next few years: the key to our city\u2019s comeback is in our people. We\u2019re going to bring more people \u2013 residents, visitors, and workers \u2013 downtown. We are investing in our workforce and city services, especially our public safety teams and teachers. We are staying true to our commitment to fund affordable housing and the programs that support our neighborhoods across all eight wards and keep DC families in DC.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the Council\u2019s partnership on this budget, especially between the first and second votes. We will continue working together to ensure we are creating and funding sustainable programs, budgeting responsibly, and preparing for the spending pressures we will need to address in next year\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nStay Connected @dczerowaste\n\n[Image 11: Facebook][Image 12: Twitter][Image 13: Instagram]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020ACCESSIBILITY\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020PRIVACY AND SECURITY\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020ABOUT DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020TERMS AND CONDITIONS\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 14: Logo]\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

Following the Council\u2019s vote, the Mayor released the following statement:\n\n\u201cI thank the Council, our budget teams, as well as our agency directors and their teams for all the work that has gone into delivering a budget our community can be proud of and that invests in the future of DC. The fiscal constraints of waning federal dollars combined with increased costs and the prolonged impacts of telework, including reduced commercial property tax revenues, created the most challenging budget in more than a decade. Over the years, our prosperity has allowed us to weather difficult moments while investing in a fair shot for all DC residents. This year, our focus was on preserving our robust social services and ensuring we can build on them for years to come. I\u2019m proud that this budget allows us to move big ideas forward to ensure a strong comeback.\n\n\u201cThis is a budget that reflects what we know to be true about the next few years: the key to our city\u2019s comeback is in our people. We\u2019re going to bring more people \u2013 residents, visitors, and workers \u2013 downtown. We are investing in our workforce and city services, especially our public safety teams and teachers. We are staying true to our commitment to fund affordable housing and the programs that support our neighborhoods across all eight wards and keep DC families in DC.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the Council\u2019s partnership on this budget, especially between the first and second votes. We will continue working together to ensure we are creating and funding sustainable programs, budgeting responsibly, and preparing for the spending pressures we will need to address in next year\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nStay Connected @dczerowaste\n\n[Image 11: Facebook][Image 12: Twitter][Image 13: Instagram]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020ACCESSIBILITY\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020PRIVACY AND SECURITY\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020ABOUT DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020TERMS AND CONDITIONS\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 14: Logo]\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

            "Yes, the D.C. Council passed the Fiscal Year 2024 budget in May 2023. The budget was described as one of the most challenging in recent years due to reduced revenue and the end of federal pandemic relief. Despite these challenges, the Council and Mayor Bowser focused on preserving social services and continuing key investments, such as affordable housing and public safety.\n\nThe budget includes some controversial measures, such as diverting funds from the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF), which could impact solar programs and the value of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). However, the Council approved the budget after making adjustments, restoring some funding for housing assistance and legal services, among other social programs. The approved budget reflects D.C.'s ongoing efforts to support vulnerable communities while managing financial constraints\u301016\u2020source\u3011\u301017\u2020source\u3011\u301018\u2020source\u3011."

                "text": "\nIn a new measure, any surplus revenue the District has at the end of this year will be spent on benefits and relief for excluded workers, though such a surplus is unlikely. Finally, the council voted to add an additional $33 million in newly available federal funding to the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) for this year, but it\u2019s not yet clear when applications will reopen.\u00a0\n\nTwo weeks ago, the council voted on the 2024 budget for the first time, restoring money for ERAP, legal services for people facing eviction, survivors of domestic violence and homeless services. The council also added money for 230 new Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) vouchers \u2014 Bowser had not funded any.\u00a0\n\nBut advocates and some councilmembers pushed for more funding for some programs, including food access and PSH vouchers. The Way Home Campaign, a group of organizations that advocate for ending homelessness, supports an additional 1,500 vouchers.\u00a0\n\nAt the May 30 meeting, Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George introduced an amendment that would require any additional money D.C. has at the end of 2023 to be distributed to people who are on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and people who did not receive unemployment benefits during the Covid-19 emergency.\u00a0\n\nThe amendment calls for the first $39 million of unexpected funds to be used to fund the G\u30103\u2020ive SNAP a Raise Act\u2020www.google.com\u3011, which would provide a local SNAP benefit to supplement federal benefits. People who are already on SNAP would receive the extra benefit from Jan. 2024 through Sept. 2024, which increases the household\u2019s monthly benefit by up to 10%. District residents who are on SNAP currently receive about $6 a day, on average, and may still be adjusting from a decrease in SNAP benefits paired with the end of the pandemic.\u00a0\n\n\u2018We have neighbors whose monthly SNAP benefits are now reduced to double and single digits,\u201d Lewis George said. \u201cWe can make the difference for these residents.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe next $20 million would be distributed to people who were excluded from receiving local and federal pandemic assistance. D.C. initially approved a benefit for excluded workers last year, but the money was never distributed, and the mayor\u2019s proposed budget for 2024 cut funding for the measure. Last year, the council estimated the money could provide a $1,000 check to about 15,000 excluded workers. Dozens of excluded workers testified throughout the budget process, calling for the money to be restored.\u00a0\n\nThe amendment passed unanimously, but Council Chair Phil Mendelson warned it was unlikely D.C. would actually have the surplus to implement it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is generally a feeling that the chances of our revenue growing to this magnitude is slim,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks should not walk away from here saying ah, we have funded SNAP.\u201d\u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nIssues |\u30104\u2020DC Budget\u3011|\u30105\u2020Social Services\u3011 \n\n* * *\n\nRegion |\u30106\u2020Washington DC\u3011 \n\n[Image 2]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Image 3]\n\nemail updates\n\nWe believe ending homelessness begins with listening to the stories of those who have experienced it.\n\n\u30107\u2020 Subscribe\u2020eepurl.com\u3011 \n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u30108\u2020 MLK Library bans sleeping outside building, threatening a refuge for people experiencing homelessness Franziska Wild \u3011 \n\n\u30109\u2020 District residents are going months without their SNAP benefits Samantha Monteiro \u3011 \n\n\u301010\u2020 Money isn\u2019t enough: How the Child Tax Credit can restore hope for D.C. families Khadijah Williams \u3011 \n\n\u301011\u2020 The 2025 D.C. budget funds over 600 new vouchers, but homeless advocacy groups say it won\u2019t be enough Donte Kirby \u3011 \n\n [Image 4]\n\n [Image 5]\n\n [Image 6]\n\n [Image 7]\n\n [Image 8]\n\n [Image 9]\n\n [Image 10]\n\n\u301012\u20201317 G Street NW, Washington D.C. 20005\u3011 | \u301013\u2020202.347.2006\u2020tel:2023472006\u3011 | \u301014\u2020Staff Directory\u3011  \nMonday - Friday, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. | Federal Schedule (\u301015\u2020check operating status\u2020www.opm.gov\u3011)\n\n\u00a92024 Street Sense Media | Advertise With Us | Newsroom Ethics and Standards | Member: International Network of Street Papers\n\n[Image 11]\n\nSearch\n\n[Image 12]\n\n  * ARTICLES\n  * \u30101\u2020News\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Opinion\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Art\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Obituaries & Memorials\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Artist/Vendor Profiles\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Print Editions\u2020issuu.com\u3011\n  * \u301021\u2020Write for Us\u3011\n\n  * GET INVOLVED\n  * \u301022\u2020Donate\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Connect\u3011\n  * \u301024\u2020Download Our App\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Volunteer Opportunities\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Intern\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Advertise\u3011\n  * \u301028\u2020Jobs\u3011\n  * \u301029\u2020Events\u3011\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * \u301030\u2020Mission and History\u3011\n  * \u301031\u2020Finances\u3011\n  * \u301032\u2020Ethics and Policies\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Press Room\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n\n  * OUR TEAM\n  * \u301034\u2020Artist/Vendors\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Artists-in-Residence\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Staff\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Interns\u3011\n  * \u301037\u2020Volunteers\u3011\n  * \u3010",

              "snippet": "\nIn a new measure, any surplus revenue the District has at the end of this year will be spent on benefits and relief for excluded workers, though such a surplus is unlikely. Finally, the council voted to add an additional $33 million in newly available federal funding to the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) for this year, but it\u2019s not yet clear when applications will reopen.\u00a0\n\nTwo weeks ago, the council voted on the 2024 budget for the first time, restoring money for ERAP, legal services for people facing eviction, survivors of domestic violence and homeless services. The council also added money for 230 new Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) vouchers \u2014 Bowser had not funded any.\u00a0\n\nBut advocates and some councilmembers pushed for more funding for some programs, including food access and PSH vouchers. The Way Home Campaign, a group of organizations that advocate for ending homelessness, supports an additional 1,500 vouchers.\u00a0\n\nAt the May 30 meeting, Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George introduced an amendment that would require any additional money D.C. has at the end of 2023 to be distributed to people who are on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and people who did not receive unemployment benefits during the Covid-19 emergency.\u00a0\n\nThe amendment calls for the first $39 million of unexpected funds to be used to fund the G\u30103\u2020ive SNAP a Raise Act\u2020www.google.com\u3011, which would provide a local SNAP benefit to supplement federal benefits. People who are already on SNAP would receive the extra benefit from Jan. 2024 through Sept. 2024, which increases the household\u2019s monthly benefit by up to 10%. District residents who are on SNAP currently receive about $6 a day, on average, and may still be adjusting from a decrease in SNAP benefits paired with the end of the pandemic.\u00a0\n\n\u2018We have neighbors whose monthly SNAP benefits are now reduced to double and single digits,\u201d Lewis George said. \u201cWe can make the difference for these residents.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe next $20 million would be distributed to people who were excluded from receiving local and federal pandemic assistance. D.C. initially approved a benefit for excluded workers last year, but the money was never distributed, and the mayor\u2019s proposed budget for 2024 cut funding for the measure. Last year, the council estimated the money could provide a $1,000 check to about 15,000 excluded workers. Dozens of excluded workers testified throughout the budget process, calling for the money to be restored.\u00a0\n\nThe amendment passed unanimously, but Council Chair Phil Mendelson warned it was unlikely D.C. would actually have the surplus to implement it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is generally a feeling that the chances of our revenue growing to this magnitude is slim,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks should not walk away from here saying ah, we have funded SNAP.\u201d\u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nIssues |\u30104\u2020DC Budget\u3011|\u30105\u2020Social Services\u3011 \n\n* * *\n\nRegion |\u30106\u2020Washington DC\u3011 \n\n[Image 2]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Image 3]\n\nemail updates\n\nWe believe ending homelessness begins with listening to the stories of those who have experienced it.\n\n\u30107\u2020 Subscribe\u2020eepurl.com\u3011 \n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u30108\u2020 MLK Library bans sleeping outside building, threatening a refuge for people experiencing homelessness Franziska Wild \u3011 \n\n\u30109\u2020 District residents are going months without their SNAP benefits Samantha Monteiro \u3011 \n\n\u301010\u2020 Money isn\u2019t enough: How the Child Tax Credit can restore hope for D.C. families Khadijah Williams \u3011 \n\n\u301011\u2020 The 2025 D.C. budget funds over 600 new vouchers, but homeless advocacy groups say it won\u2019t be enough Donte Kirby \u3011 \n\n [Image 4]\n\n [Image 5]\n\n [Image 6]\n\n [Image 7]\n\n [Image 8]\n\n [Image 9]\n\n [Image 10]\n\n\u301012\u20201317 G Street NW, Washington D.C. 20005\u3011 | \u301013\u2020202.347.2006\u2020tel:2023472006\u3011 | \u301014\u2020Staff Directory\u3011  \nMonday - Friday, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. | Federal Schedule (\u301015\u2020check operating status\u2020www.opm.gov\u3011)\n\n\u00a92024 Street Sense Media | Advertise With Us | Newsroom Ethics and Standards | Member: International Network of Street Papers\n\n[Image 11]\n\nSearch\n\n[Image 12]\n\n  * ARTICLES\n  * \u30101\u2020News\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Opinion\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Art\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Obituaries & Memorials\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Artist/Vendor Profiles\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Print Editions\u2020issuu.com\u3011\n  * \u301021\u2020Write for Us\u3011\n\n  * GET INVOLVED\n  * \u301022\u2020Donate\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Connect\u3011\n  * \u301024\u2020Download Our App\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Volunteer Opportunities\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Intern\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Advertise\u3011\n  * \u301028\u2020Jobs\u3011\n  * \u301029\u2020Events\u3011\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * \u301030\u2020Mission and History\u3011\n  * \u301031\u2020Finances\u3011\n  * \u301032\u2020Ethics and Policies\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Press Room\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n\n  * OUR TEAM\n  * \u301034\u2020Artist/Vendors\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Artists-in-Residence\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Staff\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Interns\u3011\n  * \u301037\u2020Volunteers\u3011\n  * \u3010"

With unsheltered homelessness on the rise, full funding maintains the current baseline budget for outreach and makes up for the loss of outreach staff due to the sunsetting of an existing outreach pilot.The mayor partially met our ask, funding only $3.9 million for street outreach.The Council partially met our ask by adding $1.4 million to the mayor\u2019s funding, bringing the total street outreach funding to $5.3 million.   \nEnsure there are at least 150 medical respite beds for individuals. Medical respite beds offer people who are unhoused a safe place to recover from surgery and illness or to learn to manage a chronic condition.The mayor did not meet our ask, failing to add funding for additional beds.The Council also did not meet our ask.   \nInvest $13.275 million to operate two non-congregate shelter sites. This funding is necessary to provide residents at the new shelter sites the highest quality services.  \nThe mayor met our ask, fully funding operations at two non-congregate shelters.The Council maintained the mayor\u2019s funding, meeting our ask.   \nMaintain 24-hour shelter access and increase shelter staff capacity. Allowing individuals to remain at shelter sites 24 hours per day eases the experience of homelessness and facilitates connecting individuals with services.  \nThe mayor met our ask, providing sufficient funding to maintain shelter access and meet staffing needs.The Council maintained the mayor\u2019s funding, meeting our ask.   \nCreate a flexible funding program at the Department of Human Services to cover one-time move-in expenses for residents receiving a voucher or in RRH. The program should also provide storage space for unhoused residents.   \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to invest in flexible funding to cover residents\u2019 moving expenses and storage needs.The Council also did not meet our ask.   \nMaintain $1 million in funding for DC Flex, which provides cash assistance annually to working households who are struggling to afford rent.   \nThe mayor did not meet our ask.The Council also did not meet our ask, maintaining the budget proposed by the mayor.   \nIncrease the number of psychiatric beds. There are not enough psychiatric beds for unhoused residents who need intensive services.The mayor did not meet our ask, failing to increase the number of psychiatric beds.The Council also did not meet our ask.  \nIncrease Personal Needs Allowance (PNA). The current PNA for assisted living recipients falls short of what residents need to cover essentials such as hygiene products and clothing.  \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to increase the PNA. The Council also did not meet our ask.  \nRestore $5 million in cuts to the Rapid ReHousing (RRH) program for single adults and add $2.5 million to create an additional 100 slots to address demand.* This program, which already   \nhas a waitlist, supports individuals with housing search assistance, supportive services, and short-term rental assistance.The mayor proposed cutting $5 million from the RRH budget for single adults, cutting the program nearly in half.  \nThe Council did not meet our ask, failing to restore the mayor\u2019s $5 million cut or add funds for program expansion.  \n\nInclusive Economy\n\n  DCFPI\u2019s Recommendations What the Mayor\u2019s Budget Proposed What\u2019s in the Council-Approved Budget  \nFully fund the Child Wealth Building Act, or baby bonds program, at $66.5 million over the financial plan. Begin to implement the law and improve program transparency. The Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and other agencies should quickly begin enrolling eligible children in the program, publicize an implementation timeline for the program, and release updated regulations.\u00a0The mayor did not meet our ask and instead narrowed baby bonds eligibility, substantially reduced the District\u2019s contributions to future beneficiaries\u2019 baby bonds accounts\u2014including by removing the inflation index for contributions\u2014and scaled back funding for the program by three-quarters by FY 2028. The mayor\u2019s proposal applied retroactively to FY 2022, when the Child Wealth Building Act became effective.  \nThe Council partially met our ask, allocating $26.5 million across the financial plan and by restoring the program\u2019s broader eligibility thresholds. Beginning in FY 2025, children enrolled in the program will receive a maximum annual contribution of up to $1,000, contingent on available revenue from the newly-expanded online sports betting market. The annual deposit will not be indexed to inflation nor tiered by income, as under the original law.   \n\nFund and implement a rigorous evaluation of the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP).\u00a0The MBSYEP program is entering its 45^{th} year and serves 10,000 or more young workers in DC\u2014predominantly Black young workers\u2014each summer. An evaluation should assess the efficacy of the MBSYEP program.  \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to include funding for a rigorous evaluation of MBYSEP within her budget.The Council did not meet our ask. However, the Council added two new staff positions dedicated to program evaluation initiatives to the Office of the Budget Director.  \n\nInvest in guaranteed income strategies, including through additional funding to the Strong Families, Strong Futures DC guaranteed income pilot.

Begin to implement the law and improve program transparency. The Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and other agencies should quickly begin enrolling eligible children in the program, publicize an implementation timeline for the program, and release updated regulations.\u00a0The mayor did not meet our ask and instead narrowed baby bonds eligibility, substantially reduced the District\u2019s contributions to future beneficiaries\u2019 baby bonds accounts\u2014including by removing the inflation index for contributions\u2014and scaled back funding for the program by three-quarters by FY 2028. The mayor\u2019s proposal applied retroactively to FY 2022, when the Child Wealth Building Act became effective.  \nThe Council partially met our ask, allocating $26.5 million across the financial plan and by restoring the program\u2019s broader eligibility thresholds. Beginning in FY 2025, children enrolled in the program will receive a maximum annual contribution of up to $1,000, contingent on available revenue from the newly-expanded online sports betting market. The annual deposit will not be indexed to inflation nor tiered by income, as under the original law.   \n\nFund and implement a rigorous evaluation of the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP).\u00a0The MBSYEP program is entering its 45^{th} year and serves 10,000 or more young workers in DC\u2014predominantly Black young workers\u2014each summer.

            "The D.C. Council approved the Fiscal Year 2025 budget in June 2024. This budget faced challenges similar to previous years, with ongoing discussions about how to balance financial constraints while addressing community needs. The Council reversed several cuts proposed by Mayor Bowser, particularly in areas like affordable housing and emergency rental assistance. However, some key programs, such as funding for additional psychiatric beds and the Rapid Rehousing program, did not receive the full financial support advocates were hoping for.\n\nThe budget includes significant investments in public safety, with funding allocated to increase police capabilities, improve emergency response infrastructure, and support community safety initiatives. There are also notable allocations for modernizing recreation centers and public libraries across the city, along with continued support for homeless services and youth programs\u301024\u2020source\u3011\u301025\u2020source\u3011\u301026\u2020source\u3011\u301027\u2020source\u3011."

ERAP prevents evictions by helping residents pay overdue rent and legal costs.The mayor partially met our ask, allocating $20.2 million to ERAP.The Council partially met our ask, allocating an additional $6.7 million, bringing total funding to $26.9 million.  \nInvest $6.4 million to fully fund the Coordinated Street Outreach Network. With unsheltered homelessness on the rise, full funding maintains the current baseline budget for outreach and makes up for the loss of outreach staff due to the sunsetting of an existing outreach pilot.The mayor partially met our ask, funding only $3.9 million for street outreach.The Council partially met our ask by adding $1.4 million to the mayor\u2019s funding, bringing the total street outreach funding to $5.3 million.   \nEnsure there are at least 150 medical respite beds for individuals. Medical respite beds offer people who are unhoused a safe place to recover from surgery and illness or to learn to manage a chronic condition.The mayor did not meet our ask, failing to add funding for additional beds.The Council also did not meet our ask.   \nInvest $13.275 million to operate two non-congregate shelter sites. This funding is necessary to provide residents at the new shelter sites the highest quality services.  \nThe mayor met our ask, fully funding operations at two non-congregate shelters.The Council maintained the mayor\u2019s funding, meeting our ask.   \nMaintain 24-hour shelter access and increase shelter staff capacity. Allowing individuals to remain at shelter sites 24 hours per day eases the experience of homelessness and facilitates connecting individuals with services.  \nThe mayor met our ask, providing sufficient funding to maintain shelter access and meet staffing needs.The Council maintained the mayor\u2019s funding, meeting our ask.   \nCreate a flexible funding program at the Department of Human Services to cover one-time move-in expenses for residents receiving a voucher or in RRH. The program should also provide storage space for unhoused residents.   \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to invest in flexible funding to cover residents\u2019 moving expenses and storage needs.The Council also did not meet our ask.   \nMaintain $1 million in funding for DC Flex, which provides cash assistance annually to working households who are struggling to afford rent.   \nThe mayor did not meet our ask.The Council also did not meet our ask, maintaining the budget proposed by the mayor.   \nIncrease the number of psychiatric beds. There are not enough psychiatric beds for unhoused residents who need intensive services.The mayor did not meet our ask, failing to increase the number of psychiatric beds.The Council also did not meet our ask.  \nIncrease Personal Needs Allowance (PNA). The current PNA for assisted living recipients falls short of what residents need to cover essentials such as hygiene products and clothing.  \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to increase the PNA. The Council also did not meet our ask.  \nRestore $5 million in cuts to the Rapid ReHousing (RRH) program for single adults and add $2.5 million to create an additional 100 slots to address demand.* This program, which already   \nhas a waitlist, supports individuals with housing search assistance, supportive services, and short-term rental assistance.The mayor proposed cutting $5 million from the RRH budget for single adults, cutting the program nearly in half.  \nThe Council did not meet our ask, failing to restore the mayor\u2019s $5 million cut or add funds for program expansion.  \n\nInclusive Economy\n\n  DCFPI\u2019s Recommendations What the Mayor\u2019s Budget Proposed What\u2019s in the Council-Approved Budget  \nFully fund the Child Wealth Building Act, or baby bonds program, at $66.5 million over the financial plan. Begin to implement the law and improve program transparency. The Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and other agencies should quickly begin enrolling eligible children in the program, publicize an implementation timeline for the program, and release updated regulations.\u00a0The mayor did not meet our ask and instead narrowed baby bonds eligibility, substantially reduced the District\u2019s contributions to future beneficiaries\u2019 baby bonds accounts\u2014including by removing the inflation index for contributions\u2014and scaled back funding for the program by three-quarters by FY 2028. The mayor\u2019s proposal applied retroactively to FY 2022, when the Child Wealth Building Act became effective.  \nThe Council partially met our ask, allocating $26.5 million across the financial plan and by restoring the program\u2019s broader eligibility thresholds. Beginning in FY 2025, children enrolled in the program will receive a maximum annual contribution of up to $1,000, contingent on available revenue from the newly-expanded online sports betting market. The annual deposit will not be indexed to inflation nor tiered by income, as under the original law.   \n\nFund and implement a rigorous evaluation of the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP).\u00a0The MBSYEP program is entering its 45^{th} year and serves 10,000 or more young workers in DC\u2014predominantly Black young workers\u2014each summer. An evaluation should assess the efficacy of the MBSYEP program.  \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to include funding for a rigorous evaluation of MBYSEP within her budget.The Council did not meet our ask. However, the Council added two new staff positions dedicated to program evaluation initiatives to the Office of the Budget Director.  \n\nInvest in guaranteed income strategies, including through additional funding to the Strong Families, Strong Futures DC guaranteed income pilot.

With unsheltered homelessness on the rise, full funding maintains the current baseline budget for outreach and makes up for the loss of outreach staff due to the sunsetting of an existing outreach pilot.The mayor partially met our ask, funding only $3.9 million for street outreach.The Council partially met our ask by adding $1.4 million to the mayor\u2019s funding, bringing the total street outreach funding to $5.3 million.   \nEnsure there are at least 150 medical respite beds for individuals. Medical respite beds offer people who are unhoused a safe place to recover from surgery and illness or to learn to manage a chronic condition.The mayor did not meet our ask, failing to add funding for additional beds.The Council also did not meet our ask.   \nInvest $13.275 million to operate two non-congregate shelter sites. This funding is necessary to provide residents at the new shelter sites the highest quality services.  \nThe mayor met our ask, fully funding operations at two non-congregate shelters.The Council maintained the mayor\u2019s funding, meeting our ask.   \nMaintain 24-hour shelter access and increase shelter staff capacity. Allowing individuals to remain at shelter sites 24 hours per day eases the experience of homelessness and facilitates connecting individuals with services.  \nThe mayor met our ask, providing sufficient funding to maintain shelter access and meet staffing needs.The Council maintained the mayor\u2019s funding, meeting our ask.   \nCreate a flexible funding program at the Department of Human Services to cover one-time move-in expenses for residents receiving a voucher or in RRH. The program should also provide storage space for unhoused residents.   \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to invest in flexible funding to cover residents\u2019 moving expenses and storage needs.The Council also did not meet our ask.   \nMaintain $1 million in funding for DC Flex, which provides cash assistance annually to working households who are struggling to afford rent.   \nThe mayor did not meet our ask.The Council also did not meet our ask, maintaining the budget proposed by the mayor.   \nIncrease the number of psychiatric beds. There are not enough psychiatric beds for unhoused residents who need intensive services.The mayor did not meet our ask, failing to increase the number of psychiatric beds.The Council also did not meet our ask.  \nIncrease Personal Needs Allowance (PNA). The current PNA for assisted living recipients falls short of what residents need to cover essentials such as hygiene products and clothing.  \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to increase the PNA. The Council also did not meet our ask.  \nRestore $5 million in cuts to the Rapid ReHousing (RRH) program for single adults and add $2.5 million to create an additional 100 slots to address demand.* This program, which already   \nhas a waitlist, supports individuals with housing search assistance, supportive services, and short-term rental assistance.The mayor proposed cutting $5 million from the RRH budget for single adults, cutting the program nearly in half.  \nThe Council did not meet our ask, failing to restore the mayor\u2019s $5 million cut or add funds for program expansion.  \n\nInclusive Economy\n\n  DCFPI\u2019s Recommendations What the Mayor\u2019s Budget Proposed What\u2019s in the Council-Approved Budget  \nFully fund the Child Wealth Building Act, or baby bonds program, at $66.5 million over the financial plan. Begin to implement the law and improve program transparency. The Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and other agencies should quickly begin enrolling eligible children in the program, publicize an implementation timeline for the program, and release updated regulations.\u00a0The mayor did not meet our ask and instead narrowed baby bonds eligibility, substantially reduced the District\u2019s contributions to future beneficiaries\u2019 baby bonds accounts\u2014including by removing the inflation index for contributions\u2014and scaled back funding for the program by three-quarters by FY 2028. The mayor\u2019s proposal applied retroactively to FY 2022, when the Child Wealth Building Act became effective.  \nThe Council partially met our ask, allocating $26.5 million across the financial plan and by restoring the program\u2019s broader eligibility thresholds. Beginning in FY 2025, children enrolled in the program will receive a maximum annual contribution of up to $1,000, contingent on available revenue from the newly-expanded online sports betting market. The annual deposit will not be indexed to inflation nor tiered by income, as under the original law.   \n\nFund and implement a rigorous evaluation of the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP).\u00a0The MBSYEP program is entering its 45^{th} year and serves 10,000 or more young workers in DC\u2014predominantly Black young workers\u2014each summer. An evaluation should assess the efficacy of the MBSYEP program.  \nThe mayor did not meet our ask, failing to include funding for a rigorous evaluation of MBYSEP within her budget.The Council did not meet our ask. However, the Council added two new staff positions dedicated to program evaluation initiatives to the Office of the Budget Director.  \n\nInvest in guaranteed income strategies, including through additional funding to the Strong Families, Strong Futures DC guaranteed income pilot.  This pilot provides unrestricted direct cash assistance to mothers with low incomes in wards 5, 7, and 8.   \nThe mayor met our ask, investing $1 million in one-time funding for the third year of the Strong Families, Strong Fu"

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g",

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g",

However, a key issue here will be to ensure that while more renewable energy is being added to the District\u2019s energy mix, electricity rates remain affordable for both District businesses and residents.\n\nIn addition to the RPS, the CEDC Plan lays out other strategies for increasing local renewable energy generation, and encourages the development of innovative neighborhood-scale energy resources within the District.\n\nInitiatives\n\n  * \u301047\u2020Buy Green Power\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Clean Energy DC\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Solar Initiatives\u3011\u00a0  \n- \u301050\u2020Solar for All\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Sustainable DC\u2020www.sustainabledc.org\u3011\n  * \u301052\u2020Public Service Commission PowerPath DC\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nResources and Background\n\n  * \u301053\u2020Renewable Portfolio Standard FAQs\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020PSC Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nEducation\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Electric Vehicle Grand Prix\u3011\n\nContact TTY:\u00a0\n\n711 \n\nRelated Content:\u00a0\n\n\u301010\u2020Energy in the District\u3011\n\n  * \u301056\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301060\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301061\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301062\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: (202) 535-2881  \nTTY: (800) 855-1000  \nEmail: \u301063\u2020[email protected]\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020Ask the Director\u2020dcforms.dc.gov\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020Agency Performance\u2020oca.dc.gov\u3011\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Accessibility\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Privacy & Security\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020About DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020Terms & Conditions\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 4: DOEE's Facebook page][Ima",

            "The Fiscal Year 2025 budget for Washington, D.C. continues to support the city's ambitious clean energy goals, especially under the *Clean Energy DC* plan. This budget maintains the trajectory towards achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2032, as mandated by the *Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act*. It includes ongoing investments in the *Renewable Portfolio Standard* (RPS), which requires energy suppliers to source an increasing percentage of electricity from renewables, with 15% from local solar by 2041.\n\nA key component of the 2025 budget is the expansion of energy efficiency programs for buildings, a significant focus since building energy use accounts for a large portion of D.C.\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The *Building Energy Performance Standards* (BEPS) program continues to receive funding to help improve the energy efficiency of commercial and multifamily buildings. There are also ongoing efforts to support low-income communities through energy efficiency upgrades and workforce development initiatives in the green energy sector\u301033\u2020source\u3011\u301034\u2020source\u3011.\n\nAdditionally, the budget reinforces D.C.\u2019s commitment to transportation electrification, aiming to transition public buses, fleets, and taxis to zero-emission vehicles by 2045, with a 50% target by 2030\u301035\u2020source\u3011\u301036\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThese initiatives reflect the city's broader goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading the country in climate action."

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g",

Under the RPS, electricity suppliers must buy 100% of their power from renewable sources by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar power by 2041 (\u301046\u2020Local Solar Expansion Act of 2022\u2020code.dccouncil.gov\u3011). Through the RPS, the District can avoid a substantial portion of its projected 2032 GHG emissions. However, a key issue here will be to ensure that while more renewable energy is being added to the District\u2019s energy mix, electricity rates remain affordable for both District businesses and residents.\n\nIn addition to the RPS, the CEDC Plan lays out other strategies for increasing local renewable energy generation, and encourages the development of innovative neighborhood-scale energy resources within the District.\n\nInitiatives\n\n  * \u301047\u2020Buy Green Power\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Clean Energy DC\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Solar Initiatives\u3011\u00a0  \n- \u301050\u2020Solar for All\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Sustainable DC\u2020www.sustainabledc.org\u3011\n  * \u301052\u2020Public Service Commission PowerPath DC\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nResources and Background\n\n  * \u301053\u2020Renewable Portfolio Standard FAQs\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020PSC Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nEducation\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Electric Vehicle Grand Prix\u3011\n\nContact TTY:\u00a0\n\n711 \n\nRelated Content:\u00a0\n\n\u301010\u2020Energy in the District\u3011\n\n  * \u301056\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301060\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301061\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301062\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: (202) 535-2881  \nTTY: (800) 855-1000  \nEmail: \u301063\u2020[email protected]\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020Ask the Director\u2020dcforms.dc.gov\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020Agency Performance\u2020oca.dc.gov\u3011\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Accessibility\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Privacy & Security\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020About DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020Terms & Conditions\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 4: DOEE's Facebook page][Ima",

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g"

Under the RPS, electricity suppliers must buy 100% of their power from renewable sources by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar power by 2041 (\u301046\u2020Local Solar Expansion Act of 2022\u2020code.dccouncil.gov\u3011). Through the RPS, the District can avoid a substantial portion of its projected 2032 GHG emissions. However, a key issue here will be to ensure that while more renewable energy is being added to the District\u2019s energy mix, electricity rates remain affordable for both District businesses and residents.\n\nIn addition to the RPS, the CEDC Plan lays out other strategies for increasing local renewable energy generation, and encourages the development of innovative neighborhood-scale energy resources within the District.\n\nInitiatives\n\n  * \u301047\u2020Buy Green Power\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Clean Energy DC\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Solar Initiatives\u3011\u00a0  \n- \u301050\u2020Solar for All\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Sustainable DC\u2020www.sustainabledc.org\u3011\n  * \u301052\u2020Public Service Commission PowerPath DC\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nResources and Background\n\n  * \u301053\u2020Renewable Portfolio Standard FAQs\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020PSC Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011\n\nEducation\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Electric Vehicle Grand Prix\u3011\n\nContact TTY:\u00a0\n\n711 \n\nRelated Content:\u00a0\n\n\u301010\u2020Energy in the District\u3011\n\n  * \u301056\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301060\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301061\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301062\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: (202) 535-2881  \nTTY: (800) 855-1000  \nEmail: \u301063\u2020[email protected]\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020Ask the Director\u2020dcforms.dc.gov\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020Agency Performance\u2020oca.dc.gov\u3011\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Accessibility\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Privacy & Security\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020About DC.GOV\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020Terms & Conditions\u2020dc.gov\u3011\n\n[Image 4: DOEE's Facebook page][Ima"

The program, which was established by the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Expansion Amendment Act of 2016, is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF). For more information about Solar for All \u301027\u2020visit DOEE's Solar for All web page\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011.\n\n##  How does solar work? \n\nSolar panels, sometimes referred to as photovoltaic or PV panels, absorb the sun\u2019s energy and convert it to electricity you can use. Electricity flows into your home, as needed. Any electricity the solar panels make that you don\u2019t use is fed into the electric grid.\n\n##  Will I still get an electricity bill? \n\nYes. While the system will offset your electricity costs by about $500 per year or more, you will still be getting a portion of your electricity from the grid.\n\n##  Is the system really no-cost if I meet the income qualifications? \n\nYes. The cost of installing solar is fully covered by the DCSEU through the Solar for All Program.  \n*Please note: Applying for this program does not guarantee your eligibility to receive a solar system or other benefits. The Solar For All program operates on a first-come, first-served basis and fulfillment is dependent on funding availability.\n\n##  Do I need to own my home to go solar? \n\nNo. Renters who meet the income requirements are eligible for the program as long as the homeowner agrees to the terms and conditions of the program.\n\n##  What if my roof needs repairing? \n\nSince 2022, the Solar for All has offered roof repair to homeowners and renters who need it. If you need roof repair, please complete the interest form and flag for your assigned contractor up acceptance into the program.\n\n##  What kind of maintenance is needed for my system? \n\nAlthough daily maintenance is not required for a solar PV system, it is recommended that the customer monitor the display on the system's inverter at least quarterly to ensure the system is functioning properly.\n\n##  Who maintains the system? \n\nThe contractor who installs the system will also maintain the system over a 20-year period.\n\n## Apply to Solar for All\n\nReady to see if you qualify for no-cost rooftop solar?\u00a0Apply today to get started!\n\n\u301028\u2020 Get Started \u3011 \n\n## Impact Stories & Resources\n\nSee our impact stories and take advantage of resources that make our residential programs a breeze.\n\n  * \u301030\u2020 Customer Story No-Cost Electrification for Native River Terrace Resident No-cost upgrades help a DC resident stay in their childhood neighborhood.

          "text": "\nEnergy suppliers can comply with the solar requirement by building solar energy facilities or buying Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). Anyone in DC who owns a solar system earns one SREC for every 1000 kWh of electricity produced by a solar system. My most recent SREC sale earned me $400. The value of SRECs propels solar energy development in the District, enabling homeowners and institutions such as churches to rapidly pay for their investments in solar systems through the sale of SRECs as well as by generating electricity on our own rooftops. The value of SRECs also underpins the Solar for All program that reduces electricity bills for low-income DC residents. \n\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants from serving single-use plastic straws and stirrers, except for persons with disabilities, and only offering utensils and other single-use items on request) are only effective if enforced. DOEE is currently able to conduct 300 restaurant inspections a year. This work, we understand, is done by 3.5 FTEs, one of which is funded through the Anacostia River CleanUp and Protection Fund, a special purpose revenue fund largely paid by bag fees. But the mayor proposes to sweep all funds from the bag fee fund. At a time when more restaurant inspectors are needed, given the number of new restaurants opening and staff churn, DOEE faces having fewer resources for this valuable work. In addition, allowing the bag fee fund to be raided",

This funding will help expand the benefits of clean, solar energy to roughly 19,000 low- and moderate-income (LMI) District households.\n\n\u201cSince we established this program eight years ago, Solar for All has allowed nearly 10,000 households to save on their electric bills, supported the District\u2019s energy goals, and pushed the District forward as an energy and climate leader,\u201d said Mayor Bowser. \u201cAnd with this additional funding, we are able to expand this program to an additional 19,000 households, doubling down on a program that we know works for the District and our future.\u201d\n\nThe Solar for All program plays a critical role in the District\u2019s transition to clean energy by providing access to the benefits of solar power to LMI District households. The program was established in 2016 by Mayor Bowser and the DC Council through passage of the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act. It established a goal of providing the benefits of locally-generated community and rooftop solar to 100,000 LMI District households by 2032. To date, the program has provided 9,604 households with more than 37 megawatts of clean solar energy, which represents around $5 million in annual utility bill savings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step toward achieving the District\u2019s goal of greater reliance on renewable energy, such as solar power, and moving away from fossil fuel use,\u201d said DOEE Director Richard Jackson. \u201cWe are even closer to Mayor Bowser\u2019s plan of a greener, more livable District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration announced DOEE as one of 60 recipients of funds from \u301045\u2020EPA's $7 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund competition\u2020www.epa.gov\u3011, which is designed to deliver solar to more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households nationwide. The fund is made possible through the \u301046\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011, which enacted the nation\u2019s largest investment in clean energy and climate action.\n\nDOEE\u2019s $62.45 million award will be spread out over five years and will build on critical local investments under Solar for All to help expand the reach of community and rooftop solar to more District households. DOEE is already beginning the expansion work alongside coalition partners the DC Green Bank, DC Sustainable Energy Utility, City First Enterprises, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Interfaith Power and Light, the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative and Groundswell.\n\nDOEE has worked with DC Council to expand the program\u2019s purpose to serve residents experiencing heat stress or other climate emergencies by offering greater climate resilience. In doing so, it recently funded the first resilience hub in the District at the FH Faunteroy Community Enrichment Center in Ward 7. Such an expansion will help the thousands of LMI District residents who do not pay an electric bill. More of these resilience hubs will be possible with funds, tax credits, and loans provided through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSolar for All\u2019s success comes through its model of providing direct incentives to solar developers while leveraging additional local and federal incentives. Additionally, benefits are achieved through both net-metered rooftop solar projects for LMI single-family homeowners, as well as the deployment of community renewable energy facilities (CREFs) that generate credits for community solar subscriptions, which are necessary for most District residents who live in multi-family properties.\u00a0\n\nSolar for All was also one of the \u301047\u2020inaugural recipients\u2020www.energy.gov\u3011 of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Sunny Awards for excellence in equitable community solar development.  \n\nMayor Bowser X:\u00a0\u301048\u2020@MayorBowser\u2020www.twitter.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Instagram:\u00a0\u301049\u2020@Mayor_Bowser\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Facebook:\u00a0\u301050\u2020facebook.com/MayorMurielBowser\u2020facebook.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser YouTube:\u00a0\u301051\u2020https://www.bit.ly/eomvideos\u2020www.bit.ly\u3011\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301058\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: ",

The program, which was established by the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Expansion Amendment Act of 2016, is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF). For more information about Solar for All \u301027\u2020visit DOEE's Solar for All web page\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011.\n\n##  How does solar work? \n\nSolar panels, sometimes referred to as photovoltaic or PV panels, absorb the sun\u2019s energy and convert it to electricity you can use. Electricity flows into your home, as needed. Any electricity the solar panels make that you don\u2019t use is fed into the electric grid.\n\n##  Will I still get an electricity bill? \n\nYes. While the system will offset your electricity costs by about $500 per year or more, you will still be getting a portion of your electricity from the grid.\n\n##  Is the system really no-cost if I meet the income qualifications? \n\nYes. The cost of installing solar is fully covered by the DCSEU through the Solar for All Program.  \n*Please note: Applying for this program does not guarantee your eligibility to receive a solar system or other benefits. The Solar For All program operates on a first-come, first-served basis and fulfillment is dependent on funding availability.\n\n##  Do I need to own my home to go solar? \n\nNo. Renters who meet the income requirements are eligible for the program as long as the homeowner agrees to the terms and conditions of the program.\n\n##  What if my roof needs repairing? \n\nSince 2022, the Solar for All has offered roof repair to homeowners and renters who need it. If you need roof repair, please complete the interest form and flag for your assigned contractor up acceptance into the program.\n\n##  What kind of maintenance is needed for my system? \n\nAlthough daily maintenance is not required for a solar PV system, it is recommended that the customer monitor the display on the system's inverter at least quarterly to ensure the system is functioning properly.\n\n##  Who maintains the system? \n\nThe contractor who installs the system will also maintain the system over a 20-year period.\n\n## Apply to Solar for All\n\nReady to see if you qualify for no-cost rooftop solar?\u00a0Apply today to get started!\n\n\u301028\u2020 Get Started \u3011 \n\n## Impact Stories & Resources\n\nSee our impact stories and take advantage of resources that make our residential programs a breeze.\n\n  * \u301030\u2020 Customer Story No-Cost Electrification for Native River Terrace Resident No-cost upgrades help a DC resident stay in their childhood neighborhood.

                "url": "https://www.sierraclub.org/dc/blog/2024/04/proposed-dc-budget-includes-devastating-cuts-and-short-sighted-attempts-undo",
                "text": "\nEnergy suppliers can comply with the solar requirement by building solar energy facilities or buying Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). Anyone in DC who owns a solar system earns one SREC for every 1000 kWh of electricity produced by a solar system. My most recent SREC sale earned me $400. The value of SRECs propels solar energy development in the District, enabling homeowners and institutions such as churches to rapidly pay for their investments in solar systems through the sale of SRECs as well as by generating electricity on our own rooftops. The value of SRECs also underpins the Solar for All program that reduces electricity bills for low-income DC residents. \n\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants from serving single-use plastic straws and stirrers, except for persons with disabilities, and only offering utensils and other single-use items on request) are only effective if enforced. DOEE is currently able to conduct 300 restaurant inspections a year. This work, we understand, is done by 3.5 FTEs, one of which is funded through the Anacostia River CleanUp and Protection Fund, a special purpose revenue fund largely paid by bag fees. But the mayor proposes to sweep all funds from the bag fee fund. At a time when more restaurant inspectors are needed, given the number of new restaurants opening and staff churn, DOEE faces having fewer resources for this valuable work. In addition, allowing the bag fee fund to be raided",

This funding will help expand the benefits of clean, solar energy to roughly 19,000 low- and moderate-income (LMI) District households.\n\n\u201cSince we established this program eight years ago, Solar for All has allowed nearly 10,000 households to save on their electric bills, supported the District\u2019s energy goals, and pushed the District forward as an energy and climate leader,\u201d said Mayor Bowser. \u201cAnd with this additional funding, we are able to expand this program to an additional 19,000 households, doubling down on a program that we know works for the District and our future.\u201d\n\nThe Solar for All program plays a critical role in the District\u2019s transition to clean energy by providing access to the benefits of solar power to LMI District households. The program was established in 2016 by Mayor Bowser and the DC Council through passage of the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act. It established a goal of providing the benefits of locally-generated community and rooftop solar to 100,000 LMI District households by 2032. To date, the program has provided 9,604 households with more than 37 megawatts of clean solar energy, which represents around $5 million in annual utility bill savings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step toward achieving the District\u2019s goal of greater reliance on renewable energy, such as solar power, and moving away from fossil fuel use,\u201d said DOEE Director Richard Jackson. \u201cWe are even closer to Mayor Bowser\u2019s plan of a greener, more livable District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration announced DOEE as one of 60 recipients of funds from \u301045\u2020EPA's $7 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund competition\u2020www.epa.gov\u3011, which is designed to deliver solar to more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households nationwide. The fund is made possible through the \u301046\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011, which enacted the nation\u2019s largest investment in clean energy and climate action.\n\nDOEE\u2019s $62.45 million award will be spread out over five years and will build on critical local investments under Solar for All to help expand the reach of community and rooftop solar to more District households. DOEE is already beginning the expansion work alongside coalition partners the DC Green Bank, DC Sustainable Energy Utility, City First Enterprises, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Interfaith Power and Light, the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative and Groundswell.\n\nDOEE has worked with DC Council to expand the program\u2019s purpose to serve residents experiencing heat stress or other climate emergencies by offering greater climate resilience. In doing so, it recently funded the first resilience hub in the District at the FH Faunteroy Community Enrichment Center in Ward 7. Such an expansion will help the thousands of LMI District residents who do not pay an electric bill. More of these resilience hubs will be possible with funds, tax credits, and loans provided through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSolar for All\u2019s success comes through its model of providing direct incentives to solar developers while leveraging additional local and federal incentives. Additionally, benefits are achieved through both net-metered rooftop solar projects for LMI single-family homeowners, as well as the deployment of community renewable energy facilities (CREFs) that generate credits for community solar subscriptions, which are necessary for most District residents who live in multi-family properties.\u00a0\n\nSolar for All was also one of the \u301047\u2020inaugural recipients\u2020www.energy.gov\u3011 of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Sunny Awards for excellence in equitable community solar development.  \n\nMayor Bowser X:\u00a0\u301048\u2020@MayorBowser\u2020www.twitter.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Instagram:\u00a0\u301049\u2020@Mayor_Bowser\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Facebook:\u00a0\u301050\u2020facebook.com/MayorMurielBowser\u2020facebook.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser YouTube:\u00a0\u301051\u2020https://www.bit.ly/eomvideos\u2020www.bit.ly\u3011\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301058\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: ",

The program, which was established by the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Expansion Amendment Act of 2016, is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF). For more information about Solar for All \u301027\u2020visit DOEE's Solar for All web page\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011.\n\n##  How does solar work? \n\nSolar panels, sometimes referred to as photovoltaic or PV panels, absorb the sun\u2019s energy and convert it to electricity you can use. Electricity flows into your home, as needed. Any electricity the solar panels make that you don\u2019t use is fed into the electric grid.\n\n##  Will I still get an electricity bill? \n\nYes. While the system will offset your electricity costs by about $500 per year or more, you will still be getting a portion of your electricity from the grid.\n\n##  Is the system really no-cost if I meet the income qualifications? \n\nYes. The cost of installing solar is fully covered by the DCSEU through the Solar for All Program.  \n*Please note: Applying for this program does not guarantee your eligibility to receive a solar system or other benefits. The Solar For All program operates on a first-come, first-served basis and fulfillment is dependent on funding availability.\n\n##  Do I need to own my home to go solar? \n\nNo. Renters who meet the income requirements are eligible for the program as long as the homeowner agrees to the terms and conditions of the program.\n\n##  What if my roof needs repairing? \n\nSince 2022, the Solar for All has offered roof repair to homeowners and renters who need it. If you need roof repair, please complete the interest form and flag for your assigned contractor up acceptance into the program.\n\n##  What kind of maintenance is needed for my system? \n\nAlthough daily maintenance is not required for a solar PV system, it is recommended that the customer monitor the display on the system's inverter at least quarterly to ensure the system is functioning properly.\n\n##  Who maintains the system? \n\nThe contractor who installs the system will also maintain the system over a 20-year period.\n\n## Apply to Solar for All\n\nReady to see if you qualify for no-cost rooftop solar?\u00a0Apply today to get started!\n\n\u301028\u2020 Get Started \u3011 \n\n## Impact Stories & Resources\n\nSee our impact stories and take advantage of resources that make our residential programs a breeze.\n\n  * \u301030\u2020 Customer Story No-Cost Electrification for Native River Terrace Resident No-cost upgrades help a DC resident stay in their childhood neighborhood.

              "snippet": "\nEnergy suppliers can comply with the solar requirement by building solar energy facilities or buying Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). Anyone in DC who owns a solar system earns one SREC for every 1000 kWh of electricity produced by a solar system. My most recent SREC sale earned me $400. The value of SRECs propels solar energy development in the District, enabling homeowners and institutions such as churches to rapidly pay for their investments in solar systems through the sale of SRECs as well as by generating electricity on our own rooftops. The value of SRECs also underpins the Solar for All program that reduces electricity bills for low-income DC residents. \n\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants from serving single-use plastic straws and stirrers, except for persons with disabilities, and only offering utensils and other single-use items on request) are only effective if enforced. DOEE is currently able to conduct 300 restaurant inspections a year. This work, we understand, is done by 3.5 FTEs, one of which is funded through the Anacostia River CleanUp and Protection Fund, a special purpose revenue fund largely paid by bag fees. But the mayor proposes to sweep all funds from the bag fee fund. At a time when more restaurant inspectors are needed, given the number of new restaurants opening and staff churn, DOEE faces having fewer resources for this valuable work. In addition, allowing the bag fee fund to be raided"

This funding will help expand the benefits of clean, solar energy to roughly 19,000 low- and moderate-income (LMI) District households.\n\n\u201cSince we established this program eight years ago, Solar for All has allowed nearly 10,000 households to save on their electric bills, supported the District\u2019s energy goals, and pushed the District forward as an energy and climate leader,\u201d said Mayor Bowser. \u201cAnd with this additional funding, we are able to expand this program to an additional 19,000 households, doubling down on a program that we know works for the District and our future.\u201d\n\nThe Solar for All program plays a critical role in the District\u2019s transition to clean energy by providing access to the benefits of solar power to LMI District households. The program was established in 2016 by Mayor Bowser and the DC Council through passage of the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act. It established a goal of providing the benefits of locally-generated community and rooftop solar to 100,000 LMI District households by 2032. To date, the program has provided 9,604 households with more than 37 megawatts of clean solar energy, which represents around $5 million in annual utility bill savings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step toward achieving the District\u2019s goal of greater reliance on renewable energy, such as solar power, and moving away from fossil fuel use,\u201d said DOEE Director Richard Jackson. \u201cWe are even closer to Mayor Bowser\u2019s plan of a greener, more livable District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration announced DOEE as one of 60 recipients of funds from \u301045\u2020EPA's $7 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund competition\u2020www.epa.gov\u3011, which is designed to deliver solar to more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households nationwide. The fund is made possible through the \u301046\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011, which enacted the nation\u2019s largest investment in clean energy and climate action.\n\nDOEE\u2019s $62.45 million award will be spread out over five years and will build on critical local investments under Solar for All to help expand the reach of community and rooftop solar to more District households. DOEE is already beginning the expansion work alongside coalition partners the DC Green Bank, DC Sustainable Energy Utility, City First Enterprises, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Interfaith Power and Light, the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative and Groundswell.\n\nDOEE has worked with DC Council to expand the program\u2019s purpose to serve residents experiencing heat stress or other climate emergencies by offering greater climate resilience. In doing so, it recently funded the first resilience hub in the District at the FH Faunteroy Community Enrichment Center in Ward 7. Such an expansion will help the thousands of LMI District residents who do not pay an electric bill. More of these resilience hubs will be possible with funds, tax credits, and loans provided through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSolar for All\u2019s success comes through its model of providing direct incentives to solar developers while leveraging additional local and federal incentives. Additionally, benefits are achieved through both net-metered rooftop solar projects for LMI single-family homeowners, as well as the deployment of community renewable energy facilities (CREFs) that generate credits for community solar subscriptions, which are necessary for most District residents who live in multi-family properties.\u00a0\n\nSolar for All was also one of the \u301047\u2020inaugural recipients\u2020www.energy.gov\u3011 of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Sunny Awards for excellence in equitable community solar development.  \n\nMayor Bowser X:\u00a0\u301048\u2020@MayorBowser\u2020www.twitter.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Instagram:\u00a0\u301049\u2020@Mayor_Bowser\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Facebook:\u00a0\u301050\u2020facebook.com/MayorMurielBowser\u2020facebook.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser YouTube:\u00a0\u301051\u2020https://www.bit.ly/eomvideos\u2020www.bit.ly\u3011\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301058\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: "

          "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above.

          "text": "\n#### The Washington DC Market\n\n\u00a0A combination of extremely aggressive annual solar goals and a tough infrastructure and demographic environment have kept the DC SREC market under-supplied. However, efforts to promote greater access to solar such as a 2013 community net metering law and initiatives to promote greater penetration of solar among low-income residents, promise to increase District solar installation rates , and the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 promise to increase solar installation build rates across the District.\u00a0\n\nWashington DC is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce long term confidence of SREC\u2019s. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nThere were 4,502 solar facilities registered in DC as of January 1, 2019. These facilities generate around 175,000 SRECs per year. There are also 2,241 facilities not located in DC that will continue to qualify to sell approximately 25,000 SRECs per year in the DC market under the grand-fathering rule. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the new DC RPS requirements was bolstered to 10% until 2041, we expect SREC pricing to remain strong until the end of 2023, decrease by $100 for years 2024-2029, before stabilizing at around $200-$250 per SREC from 2029-2041, assuming SREC supply remains well below the RPS requirements. In other states where shortages have driven SREC values up we have seen steep decreases within a year or two as the prices created a climate that encourages overbuilding and leads to a crash.\u00a0\n\nThe city needs to add more than 27 MW of solar by end of 2020 to meet the current RPS targets of the District. We anticipate the new requirements along with policies which were recently passed such as Community Solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing will encourage a substantial amount of solar development in DC. There are a significant number of solar developers searching for large projects in DC. Because of its relatively small size the risk of an oversupply developing is larger than it would appear.\n\n\u30101\u2020View SRECTrade's (an SREC broker) analysis report (PDF) on the fundamentals behind SREC's and a projected decrease in oversupply in 2020 & 2021. \u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n\n#### What Are Your Options in Dealing with SREC's \n\nSREC's are an integral part of incentivizing a solar PV project. The incentive can be retained and brokered to cover your costs over the long-term, or the SREC right can be signed over to the installer for a lump-sum payment upfront to offset your high upfront costs. SREC's can be extremely profitable if the situation remains stable, and can end up providing over a 200% percent return on your investment.\n\n#### Brokering Your SREC's \n\nThere are different SREC brokerage companies out there. When brokering SREC's you have two different options of either getting the spot market price minus a specified commission percentage (usually around 5%) paid to the broker, or, signing on to a termed contract (usually between 3-5 years) providing a guaranteed locked in rate (minus commission as well). Locked in agreement rates can be substantially lower, however, will protect you from any rate fluctuations or risks such a collapse of the SREC market due to RPS demand being met for the year.\n\nRisks Associated With Brokering SREC's \n\nWhat was witnessed in Maryland in 2016 was a testimony and a reminder of the uncertainty behind the SREC market. Between a day and a night the MD SREC market went from being worth close to $200 an SREC, to under $20. This was detrimental to solar owners and investor as their return on investment just skyrocketed from 6 years to almost double than that.\n\nSigning on to termed agreement can provide some relief to this risk, for the short term at least, but rates under such an agreement are 25% to 30% lower than spot market prices.\n\nAlso since utilities have to comply by April 1st of each year, the trend we have witnessed is that SREC prices will peak the previous 2 months prior to compliance. After April, SREC prices typically hit their lowest rates, during summer months, and start to go back up around December. To get the highest rate, best time to sell SREC's is March of each year.\u00a0\n\n#### Selling Your SREC's Upfront \n\nSelling SREC's upfront, or surrendering them to your installer at the time of the install, has proven to be the most popular option among residents we've spoken to that have gone solar. One local installer estimates that about 70% of customers who purchase their systems do not retain their SREC's and prefer to have the credit applied to their purchase cost to lower their upfront costs.\u00a0\n\nSelling your SREC's upfront can reduce your upfront costs by up to 60%. That could reduce the cost of a 5 kW project from over $17,000 to around $8",

            "Yes, several of the proposed changes related to the Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) were included in the final 2025 budget, though they faced opposition. One of the key changes was a proposal to exempt the D.C. government from certain RPS obligations, allowing the government to make alternative compliance payments instead of purchasing renewable energy credits, including SRECs. This change could reduce demand for SRECs and lower their value, potentially extending the payback period for solar investments and discouraging new solar projects\u301052\u2020source\u3011\u301053\u2020source\u3011.\n\nHowever, while these changes were approved, the *Solar for All* program itself was not cut and continues to expand, thanks to federal funding from the EPA. This funding will help the program reach more low- and moderate-income households in D.C.\u301046\u2020source\u3011."

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants",

                "text": "\n#### The Washington DC Market\n\n\u00a0A combination of extremely aggressive annual solar goals and a tough infrastructure and demographic environment have kept the DC SREC market under-supplied. However, efforts to promote greater access to solar such as a 2013 community net metering law and initiatives to promote greater penetration of solar among low-income residents, promise to increase District solar installation rates , and the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 promise to increase solar installation build rates across the District.\u00a0\n\nWashington DC is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce long term confidence of SREC\u2019s. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nThere were 4,502 solar facilities registered in DC as of January 1, 2019. These facilities generate around 175,000 SRECs per year. There are also 2,241 facilities not located in DC that will continue to qualify to sell approximately 25,000 SRECs per year in the DC market under the grand-fathering rule. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the new DC RPS requirements was bolstered to 10% until 2041, we expect SREC pricing to remain strong until the end of 2023, decrease by $100 for years 2024-2029, before stabilizing at around $200-$250 per SREC from 2029-2041, assuming SREC supply remains well below the RPS requirements. In other states where shortages have driven SREC values up we have seen steep decreases within a year or two as the prices created a climate that encourages overbuilding and leads to a crash.\u00a0\n\nThe city needs to add more than 27 MW of solar by end of 2020 to meet the current RPS targets of the District. We anticipate the new requirements along with policies which were recently passed such as Community Solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing will encourage a substantial amount of solar development in DC. There are a significant number of solar developers searching for large projects in DC. Because of its relatively small size the risk of an oversupply developing is larger than it would appear.\n\n\u30101\u2020View SRECTrade's (an SREC broker) analysis report (PDF) on the fundamentals behind SREC's and a projected decrease in oversupply in 2020 & 2021. \u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n\n#### What Are Your Options in Dealing with SREC's \n\nSREC's are an integral part of incentivizing a solar PV project. The incentive can be retained and brokered to cover your costs over the long-term, or the SREC right can be signed over to the installer for a lump-sum payment upfront to offset your high upfront costs. SREC's can be extremely profitable if the situation remains stable, and can end up providing over a 200% percent return on your investment.\n\n#### Brokering Your SREC's \n\nThere are different SREC brokerage companies out there. When brokering SREC's you have two different options of either getting the spot market price minus a specified commission percentage (usually around 5%) paid to the broker, or, signing on to a termed contract (usually between 3-5 years) providing a guaranteed locked in rate (minus commission as well). Locked in agreement rates can be substantially lower, however, will protect you from any rate fluctuations or risks such a collapse of the SREC market due to RPS demand being met for the year.\n\nRisks Associated With Brokering SREC's \n\nWhat was witnessed in Maryland in 2016 was a testimony and a reminder of the uncertainty behind the SREC market. Between a day and a night the MD SREC market went from being worth close to $200 an SREC, to under $20. This was detrimental to solar owners and investor as their return on investment just skyrocketed from 6 years to almost double than that.\n\nSigning on to termed agreement can provide some relief to this risk, for the short term at least, but rates under such an agreement are 25% to 30% lower than spot market prices.\n\nAlso since utilities have to comply by April 1st of each year, the trend we have witnessed is that SREC prices will peak the previous 2 months prior to compliance. After April, SREC prices typically hit their lowest rates, during summer months, and start to go back up around December. To get the highest rate, best time to sell SREC's is March of each year.\u00a0\n\n#### Selling Your SREC's Upfront \n\nSelling SREC's upfront, or surrendering them to your installer at the time of the install, has proven to be the most popular option among residents we've spoken to that have gone solar. One local installer estimates that about 70% of customers who purchase their systems do not retain their SREC's and prefer to have the credit applied to their purchase cost to lower their upfront costs.\u00a0\n\nSelling your SREC's upfront can reduce your upfront costs by up to 60%. That could reduce the cost of a 5 kW project from over $17,000 to around $8",

This funding will help expand the benefits of clean, solar energy to roughly 19,000 low- and moderate-income (LMI) District households.\n\n\u201cSince we established this program eight years ago, Solar for All has allowed nearly 10,000 households to save on their electric bills, supported the District\u2019s energy goals, and pushed the District forward as an energy and climate leader,\u201d said Mayor Bowser. \u201cAnd with this additional funding, we are able to expand this program to an additional 19,000 households, doubling down on a program that we know works for the District and our future.\u201d\n\nThe Solar for All program plays a critical role in the District\u2019s transition to clean energy by providing access to the benefits of solar power to LMI District households. The program was established in 2016 by Mayor Bowser and the DC Council through passage of the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act. It established a goal of providing the benefits of locally-generated community and rooftop solar to 100,000 LMI District households by 2032. To date, the program has provided 9,604 households with more than 37 megawatts of clean solar energy, which represents around $5 million in annual utility bill savings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step toward achieving the District\u2019s goal of greater reliance on renewable energy, such as solar power, and moving away from fossil fuel use,\u201d said DOEE Director Richard Jackson. \u201cWe are even closer to Mayor Bowser\u2019s plan of a greener, more livable District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration announced DOEE as one of 60 recipients of funds from \u301045\u2020EPA's $7 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund competition\u2020www.epa.gov\u3011, which is designed to deliver solar to more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households nationwide. The fund is made possible through the \u301046\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011, which enacted the nation\u2019s largest investment in clean energy and climate action.\n\nDOEE\u2019s $62.45 million award will be spread out over five years and will build on critical local investments under Solar for All to help expand the reach of community and rooftop solar to more District households. DOEE is already beginning the expansion work alongside coalition partners the DC Green Bank, DC Sustainable Energy Utility, City First Enterprises, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Interfaith Power and Light, the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative and Groundswell.\n\nDOEE has worked with DC Council to expand the program\u2019s purpose to serve residents experiencing heat stress or other climate emergencies by offering greater climate resilience. In doing so, it recently funded the first resilience hub in the District at the FH Faunteroy Community Enrichment Center in Ward 7. Such an expansion will help the thousands of LMI District residents who do not pay an electric bill. More of these resilience hubs will be possible with funds, tax credits, and loans provided through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSolar for All\u2019s success comes through its model of providing direct incentives to solar developers while leveraging additional local and federal incentives. Additionally, benefits are achieved through both net-metered rooftop solar projects for LMI single-family homeowners, as well as the deployment of community renewable energy facilities (CREFs) that generate credits for community solar subscriptions, which are necessary for most District residents who live in multi-family properties.\u00a0\n\nSolar for All was also one of the \u301047\u2020inaugural recipients\u2020www.energy.gov\u3011 of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Sunny Awards for excellence in equitable community solar development.  \n\nMayor Bowser X:\u00a0\u301048\u2020@MayorBowser\u2020www.twitter.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Instagram:\u00a0\u301049\u2020@Mayor_Bowser\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Facebook:\u00a0\u301050\u2020facebook.com/MayorMurielBowser\u2020facebook.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser YouTube:\u00a0\u301051\u2020https://www.bit.ly/eomvideos\u2020www.bit.ly\u3011\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301058\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: ",

              "snippet": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants"

              "snippet": "\n#### The Washington DC Market\n\n\u00a0A combination of extremely aggressive annual solar goals and a tough infrastructure and demographic environment have kept the DC SREC market under-supplied. However, efforts to promote greater access to solar such as a 2013 community net metering law and initiatives to promote greater penetration of solar among low-income residents, promise to increase District solar installation rates , and the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 promise to increase solar installation build rates across the District.\u00a0\n\nWashington DC is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce long term confidence of SREC\u2019s. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nThere were 4,502 solar facilities registered in DC as of January 1, 2019. These facilities generate around 175,000 SRECs per year. There are also 2,241 facilities not located in DC that will continue to qualify to sell approximately 25,000 SRECs per year in the DC market under the grand-fathering rule. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the new DC RPS requirements was bolstered to 10% until 2041, we expect SREC pricing to remain strong until the end of 2023, decrease by $100 for years 2024-2029, before stabilizing at around $200-$250 per SREC from 2029-2041, assuming SREC supply remains well below the RPS requirements. In other states where shortages have driven SREC values up we have seen steep decreases within a year or two as the prices created a climate that encourages overbuilding and leads to a crash.\u00a0\n\nThe city needs to add more than 27 MW of solar by end of 2020 to meet the current RPS targets of the District. We anticipate the new requirements along with policies which were recently passed such as Community Solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing will encourage a substantial amount of solar development in DC. There are a significant number of solar developers searching for large projects in DC. Because of its relatively small size the risk of an oversupply developing is larger than it would appear.\n\n\u30101\u2020View SRECTrade's (an SREC broker) analysis report (PDF) on the fundamentals behind SREC's and a projected decrease in oversupply in 2020 & 2021. \u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n\n#### What Are Your Options in Dealing with SREC's \n\nSREC's are an integral part of incentivizing a solar PV project. The incentive can be retained and brokered to cover your costs over the long-term, or the SREC right can be signed over to the installer for a lump-sum payment upfront to offset your high upfront costs. SREC's can be extremely profitable if the situation remains stable, and can end up providing over a 200% percent return on your investment.\n\n#### Brokering Your SREC's \n\nThere are different SREC brokerage companies out there. When brokering SREC's you have two different options of either getting the spot market price minus a specified commission percentage (usually around 5%) paid to the broker, or, signing on to a termed contract (usually between 3-5 years) providing a guaranteed locked in rate (minus commission as well). Locked in agreement rates can be substantially lower, however, will protect you from any rate fluctuations or risks such a collapse of the SREC market due to RPS demand being met for the year.\n\nRisks Associated With Brokering SREC's \n\nWhat was witnessed in Maryland in 2016 was a testimony and a reminder of the uncertainty behind the SREC market. Between a day and a night the MD SREC market went from being worth close to $200 an SREC, to under $20. This was detrimental to solar owners and investor as their return on investment just skyrocketed from 6 years to almost double than that.\n\nSigning on to termed agreement can provide some relief to this risk, for the short term at least, but rates under such an agreement are 25% to 30% lower than spot market prices.\n\nAlso since utilities have to comply by April 1st of each year, the trend we have witnessed is that SREC prices will peak the previous 2 months prior to compliance. After April, SREC prices typically hit their lowest rates, during summer months, and start to go back up around December. To get the highest rate, best time to sell SREC's is March of each year.\u00a0\n\n#### Selling Your SREC's Upfront \n\nSelling SREC's upfront, or surrendering them to your installer at the time of the install, has proven to be the most popular option among residents we've spoken to that have gone solar. One local installer estimates that about 70% of customers who purchase their systems do not retain their SREC's and prefer to have the credit applied to their purchase cost to lower their upfront costs.\u00a0\n\nSelling your SREC's upfront can reduce your upfront costs by up to 60%. That could reduce the cost of a 5 kW project from over $17,000 to around $8"

This funding will help expand the benefits of clean, solar energy to roughly 19,000 low- and moderate-income (LMI) District households.\n\n\u201cSince we established this program eight years ago, Solar for All has allowed nearly 10,000 households to save on their electric bills, supported the District\u2019s energy goals, and pushed the District forward as an energy and climate leader,\u201d said Mayor Bowser. \u201cAnd with this additional funding, we are able to expand this program to an additional 19,000 households, doubling down on a program that we know works for the District and our future.\u201d\n\nThe Solar for All program plays a critical role in the District\u2019s transition to clean energy by providing access to the benefits of solar power to LMI District households. The program was established in 2016 by Mayor Bowser and the DC Council through passage of the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act. It established a goal of providing the benefits of locally-generated community and rooftop solar to 100,000 LMI District households by 2032. To date, the program has provided 9,604 households with more than 37 megawatts of clean solar energy, which represents around $5 million in annual utility bill savings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step toward achieving the District\u2019s goal of greater reliance on renewable energy, such as solar power, and moving away from fossil fuel use,\u201d said DOEE Director Richard Jackson. \u201cWe are even closer to Mayor Bowser\u2019s plan of a greener, more livable District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration announced DOEE as one of 60 recipients of funds from \u301045\u2020EPA's $7 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund competition\u2020www.epa.gov\u3011, which is designed to deliver solar to more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households nationwide. The fund is made possible through the \u301046\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011, which enacted the nation\u2019s largest investment in clean energy and climate action.\n\nDOEE\u2019s $62.45 million award will be spread out over five years and will build on critical local investments under Solar for All to help expand the reach of community and rooftop solar to more District households. DOEE is already beginning the expansion work alongside coalition partners the DC Green Bank, DC Sustainable Energy Utility, City First Enterprises, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Interfaith Power and Light, the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative and Groundswell.\n\nDOEE has worked with DC Council to expand the program\u2019s purpose to serve residents experiencing heat stress or other climate emergencies by offering greater climate resilience. In doing so, it recently funded the first resilience hub in the District at the FH Faunteroy Community Enrichment Center in Ward 7. Such an expansion will help the thousands of LMI District residents who do not pay an electric bill. More of these resilience hubs will be possible with funds, tax credits, and loans provided through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSolar for All\u2019s success comes through its model of providing direct incentives to solar developers while leveraging additional local and federal incentives. Additionally, benefits are achieved through both net-metered rooftop solar projects for LMI single-family homeowners, as well as the deployment of community renewable energy facilities (CREFs) that generate credits for community solar subscriptions, which are necessary for most District residents who live in multi-family properties.\u00a0\n\nSolar for All was also one of the \u301047\u2020inaugural recipients\u2020www.energy.gov\u3011 of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Sunny Awards for excellence in equitable community solar development.  \n\nMayor Bowser X:\u00a0\u301048\u2020@MayorBowser\u2020www.twitter.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Instagram:\u00a0\u301049\u2020@Mayor_Bowser\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser Facebook:\u00a0\u301050\u2020facebook.com/MayorMurielBowser\u2020facebook.com\u3011  \nMayor Bowser YouTube:\u00a0\u301051\u2020https://www.bit.ly/eomvideos\u2020www.bit.ly\u3011\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Amharic (\u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)\u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020French (Fran\u00e7ais)\u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t)\u3011\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: \u301058\u2020(202) 535-2600\u2020tel:202-535-2600\u3011  \nFax: "

            "The recent changes to Washington D.C.'s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), particularly the exemption of the D.C. government from purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and instead allowing them to make alternative compliance payments, are impacting the SREC market by reducing demand.

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants",

                "text": "\n#### The Washington DC Market\n\n\u00a0A combination of extremely aggressive annual solar goals and a tough infrastructure and demographic environment have kept the DC SREC market under-supplied. However, efforts to promote greater access to solar such as a 2013 community net metering law and initiatives to promote greater penetration of solar among low-income residents, promise to increase District solar installation rates , and the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 promise to increase solar installation build rates across the District.\u00a0\n\nWashington DC is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce long term confidence of SREC\u2019s. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nThere were 4,502 solar facilities registered in DC as of January 1, 2019. These facilities generate around 175,000 SRECs per year. There are also 2,241 facilities not located in DC that will continue to qualify to sell approximately 25,000 SRECs per year in the DC market under the grand-fathering rule. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the new DC RPS requirements was bolstered to 10% until 2041, we expect SREC pricing to remain strong until the end of 2023, decrease by $100 for years 2024-2029, before stabilizing at around $200-$250 per SREC from 2029-2041, assuming SREC supply remains well below the RPS requirements. In other states where shortages have driven SREC values up we have seen steep decreases within a year or two as the prices created a climate that encourages overbuilding and leads to a crash.\u00a0\n\nThe city needs to add more than 27 MW of solar by end of 2020 to meet the current RPS targets of the District. We anticipate the new requirements along with policies which were recently passed such as Community Solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing will encourage a substantial amount of solar development in DC. There are a significant number of solar developers searching for large projects in DC. Because of its relatively small size the risk of an oversupply developing is larger than it would appear.\n\n\u30101\u2020View SRECTrade's (an SREC broker) analysis report (PDF) on the fundamentals behind SREC's and a projected decrease in oversupply in 2020 & 2021. \u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n\n#### What Are Your Options in Dealing with SREC's \n\nSREC's are an integral part of incentivizing a solar PV project. The incentive can be retained and brokered to cover your costs over the long-term, or the SREC right can be signed over to the installer for a lump-sum payment upfront to offset your high upfront costs. SREC's can be extremely profitable if the situation remains stable, and can end up providing over a 200% percent return on your investment.\n\n#### Brokering Your SREC's \n\nThere are different SREC brokerage companies out there. When brokering SREC's you have two different options of either getting the spot market price minus a specified commission percentage (usually around 5%) paid to the broker, or, signing on to a termed contract (usually between 3-5 years) providing a guaranteed locked in rate (minus commission as well). Locked in agreement rates can be substantially lower, however, will protect you from any rate fluctuations or risks such a collapse of the SREC market due to RPS demand being met for the year.\n\nRisks Associated With Brokering SREC's \n\nWhat was witnessed in Maryland in 2016 was a testimony and a reminder of the uncertainty behind the SREC market.

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants",

However, efforts to promote greater access to solar such as a 2013 community net metering law and initiatives to promote greater penetration of solar among low-income residents, promise to increase District solar installation rates , and the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 promise to increase solar installation build rates across the District.\u00a0\n\nWashington DC is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce long term confidence of SREC\u2019s. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nThere were 4,502 solar facilities registered in DC as of January 1, 2019. These facilities generate around 175,000 SRECs per year. There are also 2,241 facilities not located in DC that will continue to qualify to sell approximately 25,000 SRECs per year in the DC market under the grand-fathering rule. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the new DC RPS requirements was bolstered to 10% until 2041, we expect SREC pricing to remain strong until the end of 2023, decrease by $100 for years 2024-2029, before stabilizing at around $200-$250 per SREC from 2029-2041, assuming SREC supply remains well below the RPS requirements. In other states where shortages have driven SREC values up we have seen steep decreases within a year or two as the prices created a climate that encourages overbuilding and leads to a crash.\u00a0\n\nThe city needs to add more than 27 MW of solar by end of 2020 to meet the current RPS targets of the District. We anticipate the new requirements along with policies which were recently passed such as Community Solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing will encourage a substantial amount of solar development in DC. There are a significant number of solar developers searching for large projects in DC. Because of its relatively small size the risk of an oversupply developing is larger than it would appear.\n\n\u30101\u2020View SRECTrade's (an SREC broker) analysis report (PDF) on the fundamentals behind SREC's and a projected decrease in oversupply in 2020 & 2021. \u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n\n#### What Are Your Options in Dealing with SREC's \n\nSREC's are an integral part of incentivizing a solar PV project. The incentive can be retained and brokered to cover your costs over the long-term, or the SREC right can be signed over to the installer for a lump-sum payment upfront to offset your high upfront costs. SREC's can be extremely profitable if the situation remains stable, and can end up providing over a 200% percent return on your investment.\n\n#### Brokering Your SREC's \n\nThere are different SREC brokerage companies out there. When brokering SREC's you have two different options of either getting the spot market price minus a specified commission percentage (usually around 5%) paid to the broker, or, signing on to a termed contract (usually between 3-5 years) providing a guaranteed locked in rate (minus commission as well). Locked in agreement rates can be substantially lower, however, will protect you from any rate fluctuations or risks such a collapse of the SREC market due to RPS demand being met for the year.\n\nRisks Associated With Brokering SREC's \n\nWhat was witnessed in Maryland in 2016 was a testimony and a reminder of the uncertainty behind the SREC market. Between a day and a night the MD SREC market went from being worth close to $200 an SREC, to under $20. This was detrimental to solar owners and investor as their return on investment just skyrocketed from 6 years to almost double than that.\n\nSigning on to termed agreement can provide some relief to this risk, for the short term at least, but rates under such an agreement are 25% to 30% lower than spot market prices.\n\nAlso since utilities have to comply by April 1st of each year, the trend we have witnessed is that SREC prices will peak the previous 2 months prior to compliance.

However, efforts to promote greater access to solar such as a 2013 community net metering law and initiatives to promote greater penetration of solar among low-income residents, promise to increase District solar installation rates , and the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 promise to increase solar installation build rates across the District.\u00a0\n\nWashington DC is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce long term confidence of SREC\u2019s. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nThere were 4,502 solar facilities registered in DC as of January 1, 2019. These facilities generate around 175,000 SRECs per year. There are also 2,241 facilities not located in DC that will continue to qualify to sell approximately 25,000 SRECs per year in the DC market under the grand-fathering rule. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the new DC RPS requirements was bolstered to 10% until 2041, we expect SREC pricing to remain strong until the end of 2023, decrease by $100 for years 2024-2029, before stabilizing at around $200-$250 per SREC from 2029-2041, assuming SREC supply remains well below the RPS requirements. In other states where shortages have driven SREC values up we have seen steep decreases within a year or two as the prices created a climate that encourages overbuilding and leads to a crash.\u00a0\n\nThe city needs to add more than 27 MW of solar by end of 2020 to meet the current RPS targets of the District. We anticipate the new requirements along with policies which were recently passed such as Community Solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing will encourage a substantial amount of solar development in DC. There are a significant number of solar developers searching for large projects in DC. Because of its relatively small size the risk of an oversupply developing is larger than it would appear.\n\n\u30101\u2020View SRECTrade's (an SREC broker) analysis report (PDF) on the fundamentals behind SREC's and a projected decrease in oversupply in 2020 & 2021. \u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n\n#### What Are Your Options in Dealing with SREC's \n\nSREC's are an integral part of incentivizing a solar PV project. The incentive can be retained and brokered to cover your costs over the long-term, or the SREC right can be signed over to the installer for a lump-sum payment upfront to offset your high upfront costs. SREC's can be extremely profitable if the situation remains stable, and can end up providing over a 200% percent return on your investment.\n\n#### Brokering Your SREC's \n\nThere are different SREC brokerage companies out there. When brokering SREC's you have two different options of either getting the spot market price minus a specified commission percentage (usually around 5%) paid to the broker, or, signing on to a termed contract (usually between 3-5 years) providing a guaranteed locked in rate (minus commission as well). Locked in agreement rates can be substantially lower, however, will protect you from any rate fluctuations or risks such a collapse of the SREC market due to RPS demand being met for the year.\n\nRisks Associated With Brokering SREC's \n\nWhat was witnessed in Maryland in 2016 was a testimony and a reminder of the uncertainty behind the SREC market. Between a day and a night the MD SREC market went from being worth close to $200 an SREC, to under $20. This was detrimental to solar owners and investor as their return on investment just skyrocketed from 6 years to almost double than that.\n\nSigning on to termed agreement can provide some relief to this risk, for the short term at least, but rates under such an agreement are 25% to 30% lower than spot market prices.\n\nAlso since utilities have to comply by April 1st of each year, the trend we have witnessed is that SREC prices will peak the previous 2 months prior to compliance. After April, SREC prices typically hit their lowest rates, during summer months, and start to go back up around December. To get the highest rate, best time to sell SREC's is March of each year.\u00a0\n\n#### Selling Your SREC's Upfront \n\nSelling SREC's upfront, or surrendering them to your installer at the time of the install, has proven to be the most popular option among residents we've spoken to that have gone solar. One local installer estimates that about 70% of customers who purchase their systems do not retain their SREC's and prefer to have the credit applied to their purchase cost to lower their upfront costs.\u00a0\n\nSelling your SREC's upfront can reduce your upfront costs by up to 60%. That could reduce the cost of a 5 kW project from over $17,000 to around $8"

              "snippet": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants"

Initiatives aimed at enhancing solar accessibility, including a community net metering law introduced in 2013 and efforts to boost solar adoption among low-income households, have elevated the rate of solar installations in the District. \n\nAdditionally, the enactment of the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act in 2018 has further accelerated the pace of solar installations throughout the area.\n\nWashington, DC, is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation, and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce the long-term confidence in SRECs. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nDC has the most lucrative SREC program in the country. Pricing for a Washington DC SREC in 2024 is around $440.\n\nWashington DC systems are also eligible for the \u301010\u2020Pennsylvania Tier I (PATI) market\u3011.\n\nCSG will register your system in the highest-priced market that your system is eligible to receive.\n\nPennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market\n\nThe Pennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market is an open market where market forces determine prices. Key factors include the Alternative Compliance Penalty and supply and demand based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is a subsection of the Pennsylvania SREC Market open for all eligible systems located in the \u301011\u2020PJM Grid\u3011, which include all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\nACP and Market Trend\n\nThe PAT1 Market is ever changing, which is reflected in the pricing for RECs. The market has been trending up throughout the 2022 energy year. The Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) is set by the RPS and can be viewed as a soft benchmark for what the REC will be valued at. The SACP (or ACP) is a fee imposed on utilities and mandated purchasers for shortfalls in REC procurement.\n\nThe Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) for Tier I\u00a0 is $45/SREC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRetroactivity / Eligibility Start Date\n\nFacilities on estimates will earn credit beginning with the first full month following application submission to the PennAEPS.\n\nREC Shelf Life\n\nDC SRECs have a shelf life of 5 years. Example: A SREC generated in 2024 can be counted towards the 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 or 2028 compliance periods.\n\nPA SRECs have a shelf life of 3 years. Example: A SREC generated in 2024 can be counted towards the 2024, 2025, or 2026 compliance periods.\n\n\u301012\u2020SREC Crash Course: The Basics\u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Frequently Asked Questions\u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Payment Options\u3011\n\n  * ###  Was this article helpful? \n\nYes / No\n\n  * 0 out of 0 found this helpful\n\n##  Comments \n\n0 comments\n\nPlease \u30104\u2020sign in\u3011 to leave a comment.\n\n### Promoted articles\n\n  * \u301012\u2020 SREC Crash Course: The Basics \u3011 \n  * \u301015\u2020 Carbon Solutions Group Fee Structures & How They Compare \u3011 \n\n## Related articles\n\n  * \u301016\u2020DC State Workflow\u3011 \n  * \u301017\u2020SREC Crash Course: The Basics\u3011 \n  * \u301018\u2020Overview of State Contract Payment Options\u3011 \n  * \u301019\u2020Massachusetts Market Overview\u3011 \n  * \u301020\u2020Frequently Asked Questions for All State Markets (Except Illinois ABP)\u3011 \n\n\u00d7\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\nCopyrights \u00a9 2022 All Rights Reserved. \n\n\u301021\u2020Powered by Zendesk\u2020www.zendesk.com\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

Initiatives aimed at enhancing solar accessibility, including a community net metering law introduced in 2013 and efforts to boost solar adoption among low-income households, have elevated the rate of solar installations in the District. \n\nAdditionally, the enactment of the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act in 2018 has further accelerated the pace of solar installations throughout the area.\n\nWashington, DC, is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation, and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce the long-term confidence in SRECs. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nDC has the most lucrative SREC program in the country. Pricing for a Washington DC SREC in 2024 is around $440.\n\nWashington DC systems are also eligible for the \u301010\u2020Pennsylvania Tier I (PATI) market\u3011.\n\nCSG will register your system in the highest-priced market that your system is eligible to receive.\n\nPennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market\n\nThe Pennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market is an open market where market forces determine prices. Key factors include the Alternative Compliance Penalty and supply and demand based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is a subsection of the Pennsylvania SREC Market open for all eligible systems located in the \u301011\u2020PJM Grid\u3011, which include all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\nACP and Market Trend\n\nThe PAT1 Market is ever changing, which is reflected in the pricing for RECs. The market has been trending up throughout the 2022 energy year. The Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) is set by the RPS and can be viewed as a soft benchmark for what the REC will be valued at. The SACP (or ACP) is a fee imposed on utilities and mandated purchasers for shortfalls in REC procurement.\n\nThe Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) for Tier I\u00a0 is $45/SREC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRetroactivity / Eligibility Start Date\n\nFacilities on estimates will earn credit beginning with the first full month following application submission to the PennAEPS.\n\nREC Shelf Life\n\nDC SRECs have a shelf life of 5 years.

SRECs in Washington DC offer a great way for solar panel owners to boost their income. An SREC is earned when you generate 1 megawatt-hour of electricity in your solar system every time. You can sell these certificates to utility companies that need to meet green energy targets. So, by switching to solar, you can save on energy bills and make extra money from your \u301041\u2020solar investment\u3011 with SRECs. With Washington DC\u2019s strong support for renewable energy, now is the perfect time to learn about SRECs.\n\n[Image 0: SREC] \n\nIn this article, we will explore Washington\u2019s SREC market, its benefits, and how businesses and homeowners can take advantage of these energy credits.\n\n### What are Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs)?\n\n\u301042\u2020SRECs\u3011 are tradeable commodities which are evidence that 1 MWh of electricity was produced by the generation of renewable power. You can sell or trade these certificates\u00a0 independently from the electricity, making them a good source of income for solar system owners. The state of Washington has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, hoping to produce 100% clean electricity by 2045. SRECs, which offer financial solar incentives for the use of solar energy, are essential to this shift. They contribute to reducing the cost difference between solar energy and fossil fuels. This\u00a0 increases the appeal of solar investments for businesses and homeowners.\n\n### Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) in Washington DC : How does it work?\n\nIn the DC SREC market, SREC prices remain high due to undersupply. To achieve sustainability, a solar strategy including solar ambitions, specifics, and the district\u2019s demographic limitations is made. In July 2011, the D. C. City Council adopted a new rule that limited the supply even more by excluding out-of-state systems registered after January 31, 2011, from practicing the DC SREC Market.\n\nNew activities to prompt higher access to solar- the 2015 RPS Expansion Act, a 2013 community net metering law, and attempts to achieve a higher percentage of \u301043\u2020low-income solar programs\u3011 will enhance the solar installations across the district.\n\n[Image 1: SRECs] \n\n### What is the market price of SRECs in Washington DC?\n\nThe latest bid price for SRECs in Washington DC is $435 for A",

SRECs in Washington DC offer a great way for solar panel owners to boost their income. An SREC is earned when you generate 1 megawatt-hour of electricity in your solar system every time. You can sell these certificates to utility companies that need to meet green energy targets. So, by switching to solar, you can save on energy bills and make extra money from your \u301041\u2020solar investment\u3011 with SRECs. With Washington DC\u2019s strong support for renewable energy, now is the perfect time to learn about SRECs.\n\n[Image 0: SREC] \n\nIn this article, we will explore Washington\u2019s SREC market, its benefits, and how businesses and homeowners can take advantage of these energy credits.\n\n### What are Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs)?\n\n\u301042\u2020SRECs\u3011 are tradeable commodities which are evidence that 1 MWh of electricity was produced by the generation of renewable power. You can sell or trade these certificates\u00a0 independently from the electricity, making them a good source of income for solar system owners. The state of Washington has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, hoping to produce 100% clean electricity by 2045. SRECs, which offer financial solar incentives for the use of solar energy, are essential to this shift. They contribute to reducing the cost difference between solar energy and fossil fuels. This\u00a0 increases the appeal of solar investments for businesses and homeowners.\n\n### Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) in Washington DC : How does it work?\n\nIn the DC SREC market, SREC prices remain high due to undersupply. To achieve sustainability, a solar strategy including solar ambitions, specifics, and the district\u2019s demographic limitations is made. In July 2011, the D. C. City Council adopted a new rule that limited the supply even more by excluding out-of-state systems registered after January 31, 2011, from practicing the DC SREC Market.\n\nNew activities to prompt higher access to solar- the 2015 RPS Expansion Act, a 2013 community net metering law, and attempts to achieve a higher percentage of \u301043\u2020low-income solar programs\u3011 will enhance the solar installations across the district.\n\n[Image 1: SRECs] \n\n### What is the market price of SRECs in Washington DC?\n\nThe latest bid price for SRECs in Washington DC is $435 for A",

            "As of 2024, SREC prices in Washington, D.C. are holding steady, with current trading prices around $425 to $435 per SREC. This stability is attributed to the ongoing demand for solar installations and the city's strong Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which mandates a high percentage of solar energy. However, concerns remain about future price trends due to changes in the 2025 budget, which could lower demand by allowing the D.C. government to make alternative compliance payments instead of purchasing SRECs. This could lead to an oversupply of SRECs, which might eventually drive prices down, although the market has not seen a significant drop yet\u301062\u2020source\u3011\u301063\u2020source\u3011\u301064\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFor now, prices remain strong, but stakeholders are monitoring the situation closely, as the new policies could impact the long-term value of SRECs in the region."

Initiatives aimed at enhancing solar accessibility, including a community net metering law introduced in 2013 and efforts to boost solar adoption among low-income households, have elevated the rate of solar installations in the District. \n\nAdditionally, the enactment of the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act in 2018 has further accelerated the pace of solar installations throughout the area.\n\nWashington, DC, is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation, and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce the long-term confidence in SRECs. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nDC has the most lucrative SREC program in the country. Pricing for a Washington DC SREC in 2024 is around $440.\n\nWashington DC systems are also eligible for the \u301010\u2020Pennsylvania Tier I (PATI) market\u3011.\n\nCSG will register your system in the highest-priced market that your system is eligible to receive.\n\nPennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market\n\nThe Pennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market is an open market where market forces determine prices. Key factors include the Alternative Compliance Penalty and supply and demand based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is a subsection of the Pennsylvania SREC Market open for all eligible systems located in the \u301011\u2020PJM Grid\u3011, which include all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\nACP and Market Trend\n\nThe PAT1 Market is ever changing, which is reflected in the pricing for RECs. The market has been trending up throughout the 2022 energy year. The Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) is set by the RPS and can be viewed as a soft benchmark for what the REC will be valued at. The SACP (or ACP) is a fee imposed on utilities and mandated purchasers for shortfalls in REC procurement.\n\nThe Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) for Tier I\u00a0 is $45/SREC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRetroactivity / Eligibility Start Date\n\nFacilities on estimates will earn credit beginning with the first full month following application submission to the PennAEPS.\n\nREC Shelf Life\n\nDC SRECs have a shelf life of 5 years. Example: A SREC generated in 2024 can be counted towards the 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 or 2028 compliance periods.\n\nPA SRECs have a shelf life of 3 years. Example: A SREC generated in 2024 can be counted towards the 2024, 2025, or 2026 compliance periods.\n\n\u301012\u2020SREC Crash Course: The Basics\u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Frequently Asked Questions\u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Payment Options\u3011\n\n  * ###  Was this article helpful? \n\nYes / No\n\n  * 0 out of 0 found this helpful\n\n##  Comments \n\n0 comments\n\nPlease \u30104\u2020sign in\u3011 to leave a comment.\n\n### Promoted articles\n\n  * \u301012\u2020 SREC Crash Course: The Basics \u3011 \n  * \u301015\u2020 Carbon Solutions Group Fee Structures & How They Compare \u3011 \n\n## Related articles\n\n  * \u301016\u2020DC State Workflow\u3011 \n  * \u301017\u2020SREC Crash Course: The Basics\u3011 \n  * \u301018\u2020Overview of State Contract Payment Options\u3011 \n  * \u301019\u2020Massachusetts Market Overview\u3011 \n  * \u301020\u2020Frequently Asked Questions for All State Markets (Except Illinois ABP)\u3011 \n\n\u00d7\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\nCopyrights \u00a9 2022 All Rights Reserved. \n\n\u301021\u2020Powered by Zendesk\u2020www.zendesk.com\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

SRECs in Washington DC offer a great way for solar panel owners to boost their income. An SREC is earned when you generate 1 megawatt-hour of electricity in your solar system every time. You can sell these certificates to utility companies that need to meet green energy targets. So, by switching to solar, you can save on energy bills and make extra money from your \u301041\u2020solar investment\u3011 with SRECs. With Washington DC\u2019s strong support for renewable energy, now is the perfect time to learn about SRECs.\n\n[Image 0: SREC] \n\nIn this article, we will explore Washington\u2019s SREC market, its benefits, and how businesses and homeowners can take advantage of these energy credits.\n\n### What are Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs)?\n\n\u301042\u2020SRECs\u3011 are tradeable commodities which are evidence that 1 MWh of electricity was produced by the generation of renewable power. You can sell or trade these certificates\u00a0 independently from the electricity, making them a good source of income for solar system owners. The state of Washington has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, hoping to produce 100% clean electricity by 2045. SRECs, which offer financial solar incentives for the use of solar energy, are essential to this shift. They contribute to reducing the cost difference between solar energy and fossil fuels. This\u00a0 increases the appeal of solar investments for businesses and homeowners.\n\n### Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) in Washington DC : How does it work?\n\nIn the DC SREC market, SREC prices remain high due to undersupply. To achieve sustainability, a solar strategy including solar ambitions, specifics, and the district\u2019s demographic limitations is made. In July 2011, the D. C. City Council adopted a new rule that limited the supply even more by excluding out-of-state systems registered after January 31, 2011, from practicing the DC SREC Market.\n\nNew activities to prompt higher access to solar- the 2015 RPS Expansion Act, a 2013 community net metering law, and attempts to achieve a higher percentage of \u301043\u2020low-income solar programs\u3011 will enhance the solar installations across the district.\n\n[Image 1: SRECs] \n\n### What is the market price of SRECs in Washington DC?\n\nThe latest bid price for SRECs in Washington DC is $435 for A",

Initiatives aimed at enhancing solar accessibility, including a community net metering law introduced in 2013 and efforts to boost solar adoption among low-income households, have elevated the rate of solar installations in the District. \n\nAdditionally, the enactment of the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act in 2018 has further accelerated the pace of solar installations throughout the area.\n\nWashington, DC, is easily the strongest solar SREC market in the nation, and local policy has recently been expanded to reinforce the long-term confidence in SRECs. The CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 increased the District\u2019s renewable energy mandate to 100% by 2032 and extended the solar mandate from 5% to 10% by 2041. This means that the Alternative Compliance Penalty (ACP), the underlying driver of SREC prices, is also extended out to 2041.\n\nDC has the most lucrative SREC program in the country. Pricing for a Washington DC SREC in 2024 is around $440.\n\nWashington DC systems are also eligible for the \u301010\u2020Pennsylvania Tier I (PATI) market\u3011.\n\nCSG will register your system in the highest-priced market that your system is eligible to receive.\n\nPennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market\n\nThe Pennsylvania Tier I (PAT1) Market is an open market where market forces determine prices. Key factors include the Alternative Compliance Penalty and supply and demand based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is a subsection of the Pennsylvania SREC Market open for all eligible systems located in the \u301011\u2020PJM Grid\u3011, which include all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\nACP and Market Trend\n\nThe PAT1 Market is ever changing, which is reflected in the pricing for RECs. The market has been trending up throughout the 2022 energy year. The Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) is set by the RPS and can be viewed as a soft benchmark for what the REC will be valued at. The SACP (or ACP) is a fee imposed on utilities and mandated purchasers for shortfalls in REC procurement.\n\nThe Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) for Tier I\u00a0 is $45/SREC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRetroactivity / Eligibility Start Date\n\nFacilities on estimates will earn credit beginning with the first full month following application submission to the PennAEPS.\n\nREC Shelf Life\n\nDC SRECs have a shelf life of 5 years. Example: A SREC generated in 2024 can be counted towards the 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 or 2028 compliance periods.\n\nPA SRECs have a shelf life of 3 years. Example: A SREC generated in 2024 can be counted towards the 2024, 2025, or 2026 compliance periods.\n\n\u301012\u2020SREC Crash Course: The Basics\u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Frequently Asked Questions\u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Payment Options\u3011\n\n  * ###  Was this article helpful? \n\nYes / No\n\n  * 0 out of 0 found this helpful\n\n##  Comments \n\n0 comments\n\nPlease \u30104\u2020sign in\u3011 to leave a comment.\n\n### Promoted articles\n\n  * \u301012\u2020 SREC Crash Course: The Basics \u3011 \n  * \u301015\u2020 Carbon Solutions Group Fee Structures & How They Compare \u3011 \n\n## Related articles\n\n  * \u301016\u2020DC State Workflow\u3011 \n  * \u301017\u2020SREC Crash Course: The Basics\u3011 \n  * \u301018\u2020Overview of State Contract Payment Options\u3011 \n  * \u301019\u2020Massachusetts Market Overview\u3011 \n  * \u301020\u2020Frequently Asked Questions for All State Markets (Except Illinois ABP)\u3011 \n\n\u00d7\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\nCopyrights \u00a9 2022 All Rights Reserved. \n\n\u301021\u2020Powered by Zendesk\u2020www.zendesk.com\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%"

SRECs in Washington DC offer a great way for solar panel owners to boost their income. An SREC is earned when you generate 1 megawatt-hour of electricity in your solar system every time. You can sell these certificates to utility companies that need to meet green energy targets. So, by switching to solar, you can save on energy bills and make extra money from your \u301041\u2020solar investment\u3011 with SRECs. With Washington DC\u2019s strong support for renewable energy, now is the perfect time to learn about SRECs.\n\n[Image 0: SREC] \n\nIn this article, we will explore Washington\u2019s SREC market, its benefits, and how businesses and homeowners can take advantage of these energy credits.\n\n### What are Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs)?\n\n\u301042\u2020SRECs\u3011 are tradeable commodities which are evidence that 1 MWh of electricity was produced by the generation of renewable power. You can sell or trade these certificates\u00a0 independently from the electricity, making them a good source of income for solar system owners. The state of Washington has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, hoping to produce 100% clean electricity by 2045. SRECs, which offer financial solar incentives for the use of solar energy, are essential to this shift. They contribute to reducing the cost difference between solar energy and fossil fuels. This\u00a0 increases the appeal of solar investments for businesses and homeowners.\n\n### Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) in Washington DC : How does it work?\n\nIn the DC SREC market, SREC prices remain high due to undersupply. To achieve sustainability, a solar strategy including solar ambitions, specifics, and the district\u2019s demographic limitations is made. In July 2011, the D. C. City Council adopted a new rule that limited the supply even more by excluding out-of-state systems registered after January 31, 2011, from practicing the DC SREC Market.\n\nNew activities to prompt higher access to solar- the 2015 RPS Expansion Act, a 2013 community net metering law, and attempts to achieve a higher percentage of \u301043\u2020low-income solar programs\u3011 will enhance the solar installations across the district.\n\n[Image 1: SRECs] \n\n### What is the market price of SRECs in Washington DC?\n\nThe latest bid price for SRECs in Washington DC is $435 for A"

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g",

Both efforts are part of the RPS Expansion Amendment Act of 2016.\n\n### What are RPS and ACP? \n\nRPS is the electricity supplier\u2019s obligation to procure a certain percentage of renewable certificates from qualified renewable resources. Customers are obligated to pay for the cost of the Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) that the supplier must purchase to comply with the RPS law. The ACP is a structure that ensures suppliers fulfill their obligation if they fail to procure their targeted percentage of renewable energy for any reason.\n\n### What does this mean for DC?\n\nTo put some perspective around the costs linked to these obligations over the past few years, the Public Service Commission of DC (PSC) presented a brief assessment in a recent publication. The PSC found that in 2014, energy suppliers paid over $21M to purchase RECs and over $6M for ACPs. According to the PSC, in 2015 those same energy suppliers paid only $18M for RECs but almost $20M for the additional costs associated with the ACP. Under the current law, the PSC estimates customers will pay upwards of $330M in both RECs and ACPs between now and 2032. If the proposed legislation is passed into law, that number could be as high as $1.5B, according to the PSC.\n\nOne of the key components of the bill is an increase in the required percentage of renewables. DC recently reevaluated their standards to align with other jurisdictions, such as New York and California.\u00a0 The bill proposes the renewable requirement to increase to 50% and the solar requirement to 5% by 2032.\n\nAnother key component of the proposed bill is to raise the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP). SACP is the cost incurred by the energy supplier if there is a shortfall of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) available in the market to use for RPS compliance. The current SACP requirement is set at $500/MWh and decreases to $50/MWh by 2023. The proposed SACP in this amended bill holds the current rate of $500/MWh out to 2023. The below table shows a comparison of the rate schedules between the current and proposed legislation of SRECs under Congressional review.\n\n[Image 2: DC_Sept_image_1.jpg]\n\nThe challenge for the DC solar market is that the amount of physical space needed to meet all solar requirements is limited given the geography of the District. Currently, the projected requirements of the amended bill far exceed what is expected to be built over the time period of this proposed legislation.\n\nAccording to the PSC, about 70 MWs of DC-based solar capacity would be needed to meet the proposed solar requirements. Only a fraction of that (about 20 MWs) is certified. As a result of this expected shortfall, SRECs offered in the market are limited. DC SRECs are priced among the highest in the country. This shortfall, caused by the proposed increased targets set by the District, has put upward pressure on prices in the market.\n\n### What\u2019s next? \n\nThe proposed legislation allows for up to a five-year period for customers to be \u201cgrandfathered-in\u201d at the current rates if a contract is finalized prior to the effective date of the legislation. The term of the contract won\u2019t be allowed to exceed five years from the date the bill goes into effect (that effective date is yet to be determined) at the current rates. Following that period, PEPCO DC load would be subject to the higher RPS targets and SACPs stated in the proposed amendment.\n\nIf you have questions about the cost and budget implications of your future usage, please contact your Constellation sales representative today.\n\nPublished: September 23, 2016\n\n  * Tags:\n  * \u301010\u2020Market Intelligence\u3011\n  * \u301011\u2020Bill Sticka\u3011\n\n####  Share this article\n\n  * \u301012\u2020 Share on X \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n  * \u301013\u2020 Share on LinkedIn \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \n\nOops!

The \u301038\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program\u3011 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District\u2019s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n\u301077\u2020Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report\u3011\n\n\u301078\u2020Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports\u3011 \n\n  * \u301079\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 1, 2023\u3011\n  * \u301080\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 2, 2022\u3011\n  * \u301081\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 3, 2021\u3011\n  * \u301082\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019\u3011\n  * \u301084\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018\u3011\n  * \u301085\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301086\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301087\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016\u3011\n  * \u301088\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015",

The \u301038\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program\u3011 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District\u2019s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n\u301077\u2020Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report\u3011\n\n\u301078\u2020Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports\u3011 \n\n  * \u301079\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 1, 2023\u3011\n  * \u301080\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 2, 2022\u3011\n  * \u301081\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 3, 2021\u3011\n  * \u301082\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019\u3011\n  * \u301084\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018\u3011\n  * \u301085\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301086\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301087\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016\u3011\n  * \u301088\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015",

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g",

The increase is attributed to a new law called the \r\nLocal Solar Expansion Amendment Act of 2022. This Act \r\nincreases the solar purchase requirement of the Renewable \r\nEnergy Portfolio Standard and slows the phasedown of \r\nthe alternative compliance payment. This amendment was \r\nproposed with the goal to further encourage solar adoption \r\nwithin the District.\r\nRetail energy suppliers in Washington, DC must meet the \r\nRenewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) on behalf of their \r\ncustomers by obtaining Tier-I renewable energy certificates \r\n(RECs) based on the specified DC RPS requirement schedule. \r\nA portion of the overall Tier-I requirement is comprised of a \r\nsolar-carveout obligation that requires the purchase of solar \r\nrenewable energy credits (SRECs). Prior to the new law, the \r\nSolar Requirement ramped up to 10% by 2041. The new law \r\nincreases it to 15% by 2041.\r\nOnce effective, the new law increases solar RPS costs. \r\nHowever, included in the amendment is a provision that \r\ngrandfathers customer contracts signed prior to the effective \r\ndate. These grandfathered contracts are exempt from the \r\nincreased costs for a period of three years from the effective \r\ndate. The current projected effective date is March 15, 2023. \r\nFor example, a multiyear contract entered in January or \r\nFebruary of 2023 through December 2026, is covered by \r\nthe grandfathering provision through March 15, 2026. The \r\napplicability of the grandfather period is determined when \r\nthe contract is signed relative to effective date.\u00a0 If a customer \r\nsigns prior to effective date, that load is grandfathered until \r\nthe end of the 3-year period.\r\n02102023\r\nYear Estimated Annual \r\nSavings $/MWh\r\n2023 $0.60\r\n2024 $2.00\r\n2025 $3.30\r\n2026 $4.80\r\nThe table provides an estimate of savings for \r\nthose contracts that are signed prior to the law \r\ndate. \r\nSolar and biomass are the primary renewable \r\nresources to generate electricity within the District \r\nof Columbia, accounting for about 63% of the city\u2019s \r\ntotal net generation.\r\nConsiderations For New RPS\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g"

The increase is attributed to a new law called the \r\nLocal Solar Expansion Amendment Act of 2022. This Act \r\nincreases the solar purchase requirement of the Renewable \r\nEnergy Portfolio Standard and slows the phasedown of \r\nthe alternative compliance payment. This amendment was \r\nproposed with the goal to further encourage solar adoption \r\nwithin the District.\r\nRetail energy suppliers in Washington, DC must meet the \r\nRenewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) on behalf of their \r\ncustomers by obtaining Tier-I renewable energy certificates \r\n(RECs) based on the specified DC RPS requirement schedule. \r\nA portion of the overall Tier-I requirement is comprised of a \r\nsolar-carveout obligation that requires the purchase of solar \r\nrenewable energy credits (SRECs). Prior to the new law, the \r\nSolar Requirement ramped up to 10% by 2041. The new law \r\nincreases it to 15% by 2041.\r\nOnce effective, the new law increases solar RPS costs. \r\nHowever, included in the amendment is a provision that \r\ngrandfathers customer contracts signed prior to the effective \r\ndate. These grandfathered contracts are exempt from the \r\nincreased costs for a period of three years from the effective \r\ndate. The current projected effective date is March 15, 2023. \r\nFor example, a multiyear contract entered in January or \r\nFebruary of 2023 through December 2026, is covered by \r\nthe grandfathering provision through March 15, 2026. The \r\napplicability of the grandfather period is determined when \r\nthe contract is signed relative to effective date.\u00a0 If a customer \r\nsigns prior to effective date, that load is grandfathered until \r\nthe end of the 3-year period.\r\n02102023\r\nYear Estimated Annual \r\nSavings $/MWh\r\n2023 $0.60\r\n2024 $2.00\r\n2025 $3.30\r\n2026 $4.80\r\nThe table provides an estimate of savings for \r\nthose contracts that are signed prior to the law \r\ndate. \r\nSolar and biomass are the primary renewable \r\nresources to generate electricity within the District \r\nof Columbia, accounting for about 63% of the city\u2019s \r\ntotal net generation.\r\nConsiderations For New RPS\nVisible: 0% - 100%"

          "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants",

            "The *Fiscal Year 2025 Budget* for Washington, D.C. includes significant changes to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) through its Budget Support Act (BSA). One notable modification is the proposal to exempt the D.C. government from having to purchase renewable energy credits (RECs) to meet its solar and renewable energy obligations. Instead, the government can pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP), which could reduce demand for Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs), affecting their market value. This change is expected to decrease the value of SRECs, potentially extending the payback period for solar projects and discouraging new solar investments in the city\u301079\u2020source\u3011\u301080\u2020source\u3011.\n\nHowever, there are no additional changes in the 2025 budget specifically raising the RPS target. The current mandate remains to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2032, with 15% of that coming from local solar by 2041, as established in prior legislation\u301082\u2020source\u3011."

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions.

              "snippet": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above.

            "In the *Fiscal Year 2025 Budget* for Washington, D.C., several key changes were made to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) as part of the broader Budget Support Act (BSA):\n\n1. **Exemption for D.C. Government**: The most significant change is the exemption of the D.C. government from the requirement to purchase Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) to meet its renewable energy obligations. Instead, the government can pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP). This move is projected to reduce demand for SRECs, potentially leading to a decrease in their market value and discouraging new solar investments\u301079\u2020source\u3011\u301082\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Impact on the SREC Market**: By allowing the government to opt for ACPs instead of purchasing SRECs, there will likely be an oversupply of SRECs, further lowering their value. This could extend the payback period for solar investments, making solar energy projects less financially attractive\u301079\u2020source\u3011.\n\nNo additional changes were made to increase the RPS target, which remains at 100% renewable energy by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar by 2041, as established by previous legislation\u301070\u2020source\u3011\u301073\u2020source\u3011."

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants",

                "text": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government.

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g",

The \u301038\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program\u3011 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District\u2019s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n\u301077\u2020Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report\u3011\n\n\u301078\u2020Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports\u3011 \n\n  * \u301079\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 1, 2023\u3011\n  * \u301080\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 2, 2022\u3011\n  * \u301081\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 3, 2021\u3011\n  * \u301082\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019\u3011\n  * \u301084\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018\u3011\n  * \u301085\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301086\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301087\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016\u3011\n  * \u301088\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015",

              "snippet": "\nThe mayor\u2019s change to the RPS is an essential component of the budget gimmick described above. Her BSA proposes to essentially exempt the DC government from the RPS. This would be done by directing the government\u2019s supplier of electricity generated from dirty fossil fuels[3] to stop buying renewable energy credits from solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources and instead pay the Alternative Compliance Payment. Since the DC government uses about six or seven percent of the electricity consumed in DC, there would be a significant drop in purchases of SRECs each year. The resulting increase in supply would reduce the value of SRECS, extending the payoff time for current solar owners and discouraging new solar projects. \n\nBuilding Energy Performance Standards\n\nThe Sierra Club strongly opposes the mayor\u2019s plan to significantly delay and weaken the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS). A legislative proposal to amend BEPS has\u00a0 already been drafted, based on thoughtful discussions in the BEPS Task Force, and this bill should be considered through regular council hearings and markups. We urge the committee to drop the BEPS section from the BSA entirely. The Fiscal Impact Statement indicates that the BEPS proposals have no fiscal impact in this budget. The committee should also drop the \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d requirement for buildings owned by the District. \n\nFederal funding: Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe federal government is distributing large amounts of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the nation\u2019s transition to an economy based on clean and affordable energy. The mayor\u2019s budget is likely to hamstring DOEE\u2019s opportunities to obtain significant funding from the federal government. The recent award to DC for Solar for All is premised on expanding DC\u2019s current Solar for All programs, not backfilling them after budget cuts. \n\nGreen Finance Authority\n\nThe Sierra Club remains strongly in support of the Green Finance Authority\u2019s mission to drive private investment in clean, efficient and green infrastructure projects in the District. In addition, the Green Bank\u2019s commitment to identifying projects that advance equity considerations throughout the District has been consistent and effective.\u00a0\n\nOur understanding is that the budget as proposed by the Mayor's Office does not anticipate any allocation of funds collected in the SETF for the Green Finance Authority (GFA) despite statutory language calling for at least $10 million to be allocated each year. The \"Green Bank\" is not yet capitalized to its target of $100 million in capital and therefore is still relying on increments of new capital each year when developing its project pipeline. Our understanding is that, without funding this year, the Green Bank will have to walk away from projects in its pipeline. The Sierra Club opposes a wholesale elimination of funding for the Green Bank in this or any fiscal year.\n\nIn addition to endangering these projects, this creates concerns regarding future credibility of the GFA as it attempts to work with developers and lenders in the future, who would presumably now associate political risk with the GFA's involvement in other projects. We understand that this is a difficult year for budgeting but strongly recommend that the Green Bank's allocation be handled with care for its existing project pipeline. A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants"

A signal that the Green Bank funding is being tailored thoughtfully will send the market participants it interacts with to leverage private capital into green investment a very different message from a signal that Green Bank funding could simply disappear entirely to solve budgetary questions.\n\nCoalition letters on climate and energy equity\n\nWith our recent testimony, we have submitted these coalition letters expressing opposition to the mayor\u2019s attack on climate and energy equity programs:\n\n  * April 22 letter led by the Chesapeake Solar Energy Association\n  * April 24 letter led by the DC Environmental Network on climate and energy equity\n  * April 29 letter led by Beyond Gas DC\n\nZERO WASTE\n\nFunding for zero waste measures in the District\u2019s DOEE budget has always been modest, and largely funded through special purpose revenue (SPR) funds. The Mayor\u2019s proposed FY25 budget and Budget Support Act of 2024 would sweep these SPR funds into the general fund in a short-sighted move that hurts people, the planet and efforts to have industry bear the costs for the full lifecycle of their products. \n\nFailing to implement zero waste measures generates unnecessary waste that winds up in one of three places: landfills, incinerators, or dumped in the environment. Dumping occurs most frequently in Wards 5, 7, and 8, whose residents endure polluted parks, waterways, and neighborhoods. The incinerator used by the District is located in Lorton, Virginia, whose majority Black and brown residents are subject to the incinerator\u2019s toxic emissions. And everyone is hurt by methane-belching landfills; methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Addressing these concerns is one of the main reasons why the District recently adopted t he \u301035\u2020Zero Waste DC Plan\u2020zerowaste.dc.gov\u3011 and the \u301036\u2020Carbon Free DC Strategy\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011, announced by the Mayor to great fanfare at COP28 in Dubai last December, as noted above. It\u2019s also why the District previously enacted \u301037\u2020the straw and stirrer ban\u2020doee.dc.gov\u3011 and utensils on request measures of the \u301038\u2020Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act of 2020.\u2020lims.dccouncil.gov\u3011 All would be stymied by the mayor\u2019s proposed budget unless council acts. Acting to prevent zero waste sweeps will prevent needless harm, and ensure that the District does more than issue zero waste-related press statements or plans. The climate emergency demands more investments in zero waste measures, not cuts.\u00a0\n\nMayor\u2019s proposed sweep of bag fee fund jeopardizes DOEE\u2019s ability to enforce zero waste measures and threatens protected special purpose revenue funds\n\nExisting zero waste measures (banning restaurants"

To stay up-to-date on the latest Clean Energy DC news, \u301045\u2020sign up for the CEDC newsletter >>\u2020public.govdelivery.com\u3011\n\nThe \u301046\u2020Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 \u2020code.dccouncil.us\u3011(the CEDC Act) represents one of the country\u2019s most aggressive and impactful clean energy actions to-date and establishes the District of Columbia as a global leader in the fight against climate change. The Act codifies several key initiatives identified in the Clean Energy DC Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d)\u2014the District\u2019s detailed energy and climate action plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nThe CEDC Act promotes a wide range of new policies and initiatives that primarily target energy supply, building energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Workforce development, equity and the promotion of Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs) have also been strengthened throughout the plan. The District government is working with its community and private sector partners to implement the mandates of the CEDC Act.\n\nThe following provides a high-level summary of the Act\u2019s provisions and implementation progress:\n\n100% Renewable Electricity by 2032  \nThe Act revises the District\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) to make it one of the most aggressive in the country, mandating 100% of the District\u2019s energy supply comes from Tier 1 renewable energy sources by 2032. By 2041, at least 10% of that energy must come from solar energy generated within the District. The solar carve out has since been amended by the Local Solar Expansion Act, which mandates 15% local solar by 2041.\u00a0\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The Public Service Commission is implementing the RPS requirements and the latest information can be found on \u301047\u2020their website\u2020dcpsc.org\u3011.\n\nBuildings and Energy Efficiency  \nBuilding energy use accounts for nearly 75 percent of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation takes aggressive and innovate action to target this sector, most notably with the first-of-its-kind \u301048\u2020Building Energy Performance Standard\u3011 (BEPS). BEPS establishes a minimum energy performance for commercial and multifamily buildings. In addition to BEPS, the Act establishes a number of other initiatives and policies that will help reduce energy consumption and support the local green economy, including:\n\n  * Increasing funding for programs that benefit low-income communities, establishing workforce programs and building a pipeline of local businesses with energy expertise;\n  * Expanding utility energy efficiency and demand programs;\n  * Promoting energy efficiency at municipal buildings through the development of a Strategic Energy Management Plan.\n\nProgress update:\u00a0\n\n  * The District develop and is implementing the nation\u2019s first Building Energy Performance Standards program. More information on the program and resources related to the program can be found on DOEE\u2019s \u301049\u2020BEPS website\u2020dc.beam-portal.org\u3011.\n  * To support BEPS implementation, the District government funded the creation of the \u301050\u2020Building Innovation Hub\u2020buildinginnovationhub.org\u3011, launched the \u301051\u2020Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011, and has expanded the resources of the \u301051\u2020DC Sustainable Energy Utility\u2020www.dcseu.com\u3011 and the \u301052\u2020DC Green Bank\u2020dcgreenbank.com\u3011.\n  * The Public Service Commission is managing the utility energy efficiency and demand response programs under \u301053\u2020Formal Case 1160\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011.\u00a0\n  * The Department of General Services developed and published the \u301054\u2020Energy Management Plan\u2020dgs.dc.gov\u3011 for District-owned buildings.\u00a0\n\nTransportation Electrification  \nSecond only to buildings, transportation generates around a quarter of the District\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The Act establishes three initiatives that will help the transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles, while recognizing the city\u2019s broader goal of promoting transit, walking and biking.\n\n  * Vehicle Excise Tax: The Act calls for the vehicle excise tax formula to be revised to incentivize electric and fuel-efficient vehicles over less efficient vehicles, with certain provisions to protect low- and middle-income residents.\n  * Transportation Electrification Program: The Act mandates that 100% of public buses, public fleets, private fleets of more than 50 vehicles, and taxis and limousines are to be zero-emission by 2045 (and 50% zero-emissions by 2030). It includes a provision to incentivize the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including the authorization of the Public Service Commission to consider the electric company's application to build infrastructure that promotes the deployment of electric vehicles.\n  * Clean Vehicle Transition Plan: The Act calls for the development of a strategy that includes both policy recommendations and cost estimates to achieve the following: (1) at least 25% of vehicles registered in DC be zero-emission by 2030; (2) 100% replacement of public and school buses to electric public buses upon end of their useful life beginning in 2021; and, (3) implementation of the Mayor\u2019s Transportation Electrification Program.\n\nProgress update: \n\n  * The \u301055\u2020vehicle excise tax\u2020www.dcregs.dc.gov\u3011 incentivizing fuel-efficient and electric vehicles became effective February 1, 2021.\n  * The Transportation Electrification Program and Clean Vehicle Transition Plan were consolidated into one program, Learn more about the T\u301056\u2020ransportation Electrification Roadmap (TER)\u3011.\u00a0\n\nSustainable Energy Infrastructure Capacity Building and Pipeline Program  \nAlong with reducing greenhouse g"

The \u301038\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program\u3011 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District\u2019s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n\u301077\u2020Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report\u3011\n\n\u301078\u2020Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports\u3011 \n\n  * \u301079\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 1, 2023\u3011\n  * \u301080\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 2, 2022\u3011\n  * \u301081\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard \u2013 May 3, 2021\u3011\n  * \u301082\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020\u2020edocket.dcpsc.org\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019\u3011\n  * \u301084\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018\u3011\n  * \u301085\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301086\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017\u3011\n  * \u301087\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016\u3011\n  * \u301088\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015"
