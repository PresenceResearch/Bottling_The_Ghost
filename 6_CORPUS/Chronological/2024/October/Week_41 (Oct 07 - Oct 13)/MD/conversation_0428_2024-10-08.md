**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 14:44:40*

The current state of Washington, D.C.'s solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) is directly impacted by Mayor Bowser's recent budget decisions. A key issue is that the Mayor's 2024 fiscal plan involves diverting funds from critical renewable energy programs, including the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF), which is crucial for supporting solar initiatives like the *Solar for All* program. This diversion could reduce the value of SRECs, as the city government may shift from purchasing renewable energy credits to paying alternative compliance payments, which funnel less money into supporting local solar projects.

This has sparked concerns from environmental advocates, as reducing demand for SRECs would lead to a drop in their value, potentially extending the payback period for solar owners and discouraging new solar investments in D.C. Additionally, this budget maneuver could negatively affect ongoing projects aimed at improving energy efficiency in government buildings and maintaining the city's renewable energy goals【6†source】【7†source】. 

These budgetary actions have raised alarms about the long-term sustainability of D.C.'s clean energy transition, particularly as they may impact vulnerable communities that benefit from solar energy cost reductions【9†source】【10†source】.

Yes, the D.C. Council passed the Fiscal Year 2024 budget in May 2023. The budget was described as one of the most challenging in recent years due to reduced revenue and the end of federal pandemic relief. Despite these challenges, the Council and Mayor Bowser focused on preserving social services and continuing key investments, such as affordable housing and public safety.

The budget includes some controversial measures, such as diverting funds from the Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF), which could impact solar programs and the value of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). However, the Council approved the budget after making adjustments, restoring some funding for housing assistance and legal services, among other social programs. The approved budget reflects D.C.'s ongoing efforts to support vulnerable communities while managing financial constraints【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】.

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:10:49*

The D.C. Council approved the Fiscal Year 2025 budget in June 2024. This budget faced challenges similar to previous years, with ongoing discussions about how to balance financial constraints while addressing community needs. The Council reversed several cuts proposed by Mayor Bowser, particularly in areas like affordable housing and emergency rental assistance. However, some key programs, such as funding for additional psychiatric beds and the Rapid Rehousing program, did not receive the full financial support advocates were hoping for.

The budget includes significant investments in public safety, with funding allocated to increase police capabilities, improve emergency response infrastructure, and support community safety initiatives. There are also notable allocations for modernizing recreation centers and public libraries across the city, along with continued support for homeless services and youth programs【24†source】【25†source】【26†source】【27†source】.

What about renewable energy in the 2025 budget 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:11:35*

The Fiscal Year 2025 budget for Washington, D.C. continues to support the city's ambitious clean energy goals, especially under the *Clean Energy DC* plan. This budget maintains the trajectory towards achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2032, as mandated by the *Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act*. It includes ongoing investments in the *Renewable Portfolio Standard* (RPS), which requires energy suppliers to source an increasing percentage of electricity from renewables, with 15% from local solar by 2041.

A key component of the 2025 budget is the expansion of energy efficiency programs for buildings, a significant focus since building energy use accounts for a large portion of D.C.’s greenhouse gas emissions. The *Building Energy Performance Standards* (BEPS) program continues to receive funding to help improve the energy efficiency of commercial and multifamily buildings. There are also ongoing efforts to support low-income communities through energy efficiency upgrades and workforce development initiatives in the green energy sector【33†source】【34†source】.

Additionally, the budget reinforces D.C.’s commitment to transportation electrification, aiming to transition public buses, fleets, and taxis to zero-emission vehicles by 2045, with a 50% target by 2030【35†source】【36†source】.

These initiatives reflect the city's broader goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading the country in climate action.

Did it cancel
Solar for all)

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:12:33*

No, the *Solar for All* program in Washington, D.C. was not canceled. In fact, it received a significant boost in 2024 when it was awarded $62.45 million from the EPA as part of the federal *Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund*. This funding will allow the program to expand and serve an additional 19,000 low- and moderate-income households over the next five years, further supporting the city’s clean energy goals.

While the 2025 budget process included some proposals that could have reduced funding for renewable energy programs, such as the potential decrease in the value of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs), *Solar for All* itself continues to grow. The program remains a critical part of D.C.'s strategy to reduce energy bills for income-qualified residents and help the city transition to renewable energy【43†source】【45†source】【46†source】.

**You:**

*2024-10-08 15:12:56*

Did those proposals pass 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:13:13*

Yes, several of the proposed changes related to the Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) were included in the final 2025 budget, though they faced opposition. One of the key changes was a proposal to exempt the D.C. government from certain RPS obligations, allowing the government to make alternative compliance payments instead of purchasing renewable energy credits, including SRECs. This change could reduce demand for SRECs and lower their value, potentially extending the payback period for solar investments and discouraging new solar projects【52†source】【53†source】.

However, while these changes were approved, the *Solar for All* program itself was not cut and continues to expand, thanks to federal funding from the EPA. This funding will help the program reach more low- and moderate-income households in D.C.【46†source】.

**You:**

*2024-10-08 15:14:04*

How is that impacting the SREC market

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:14:15*

The recent changes to Washington D.C.'s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), particularly the exemption of the D.C. government from purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and instead allowing them to make alternative compliance payments, are impacting the SREC market by reducing demand. Since the D.C. government consumes around 6-7% of the city’s electricity, this exemption means a significant drop in annual SREC purchases【52†source】【53†source】.

As a result, the increased supply of SRECs without a corresponding rise in demand is expected to lower SREC prices. This price drop may extend the payback period for solar investments, making it less attractive for new projects to go solar. The lowered value of SRECs will likely affect solar owners, as it reduces the financial incentive that SRECs provide【52†source】【53†source】.

The long-term concern is that the decline in SREC prices may discourage further solar development in the city, particularly for commercial-scale and residential projects relying on SREC revenue for economic feasibility【53†source】.

Have prices for RECs changed yet 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:16:13*

As of 2024, SREC prices in Washington, D.C. are holding steady, with current trading prices around $425 to $435 per SREC. This stability is attributed to the ongoing demand for solar installations and the city's strong Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which mandates a high percentage of solar energy. However, concerns remain about future price trends due to changes in the 2025 budget, which could lower demand by allowing the D.C. government to make alternative compliance payments instead of purchasing SRECs. This could lead to an oversupply of SRECs, which might eventually drive prices down, although the market has not seen a significant drop yet【62†source】【63†source】【64†source】.

For now, prices remain strong, but stakeholders are monitoring the situation closely, as the new policies could impact the long-term value of SRECs in the region.

**You:**

*2024-10-08 15:17:03*

Are they considering raising the RPS again?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:17:18*

There is no current proposal to raise the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in Washington, D.C. beyond its already aggressive targets. The RPS, established under the *Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018*, mandates 100% renewable electricity by 2032, with a specific requirement that 15% of that must come from local solar by 2041. This goal was reinforced by the *Local Solar Expansion Amendment Act* passed in 2022, which increased the solar carve-out from 10% to 15%【70†source】【71†source】.

For now, the focus is on implementing these existing targets. While there is strong support for renewable energy expansion, no new proposals for further increases in the RPS have been introduced recently【73†source】.

**You:**

*2024-10-08 15:19:03*

Could you find that language in the 2025 budget?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:19:19*

The *Fiscal Year 2025 Budget* for Washington, D.C. includes significant changes to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) through its Budget Support Act (BSA). One notable modification is the proposal to exempt the D.C. government from having to purchase renewable energy credits (RECs) to meet its solar and renewable energy obligations. Instead, the government can pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP), which could reduce demand for Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs), affecting their market value. This change is expected to decrease the value of SRECs, potentially extending the payback period for solar projects and discouraging new solar investments in the city【79†source】【80†source】.

However, there are no additional changes in the 2025 budget specifically raising the RPS target. The current mandate remains to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2032, with 15% of that coming from local solar by 2041, as established in prior legislation【82†source】.

Sorry what other RPS changes were made 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-08 15:20:22*

In the *Fiscal Year 2025 Budget* for Washington, D.C., several key changes were made to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) as part of the broader Budget Support Act (BSA):

1. **Exemption for D.C. Government**: The most significant change is the exemption of the D.C. government from the requirement to purchase Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) to meet its renewable energy obligations. Instead, the government can pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP). This move is projected to reduce demand for SRECs, potentially leading to a decrease in their market value and discouraging new solar investments【79†source】【82†source】.

2. **Impact on the SREC Market**: By allowing the government to opt for ACPs instead of purchasing SRECs, there will likely be an oversupply of SRECs, further lowering their value. This could extend the payback period for solar investments, making solar energy projects less financially attractive【79†source】.

No additional changes were made to increase the RPS target, which remains at 100% renewable energy by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar by 2041, as established by previous legislation【70†source】【73†source】.
