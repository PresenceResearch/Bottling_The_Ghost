Can you format this properly please [intro, female narrator, reporter]
This is a story about a girl.

Not just any girl.  

The most badass girl in the whole wide world. 

That's right, baby. 

You know who I'm talking about!

[Verse 1]
[female vocal]
She grew up in Massapequa. 
(GO CHIEFS!),
On 24 West Shore Drive.
Poofy hair, dangly earrings, and lipstick. 
Depeche Mode kept her alive. (Black celebrations with the Unicorn didn’t hurt either)

[Verse 2]
She went to Boston College.
(GO. EAGLES!).
Worked hard every day.
Fell in love with all the wrong guys.
They were both probably gay.

[Pre chorus, spoken]
We're talking about you Colin Ernst! 
[Audience Laughing]

[Chorus]
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh.
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind.
She’s my favorite, my best friend, my other half.
She makes a mess, but I don't mind. 
[Break, Male Narrator]
OK...maybe a little (but I still love you)

[Verse 3]
She went to college, two more times. (Aaaahhh)
Went to Boston.  Went to work. (Oooh wah oooh)
Dated a few stupid loser guys. (Oooo, oooo)
Trumpet players are real jerks 

[Bridge]
She worked so hard, giving it her all (oooh).
Moved to New York City, heeded its call (ooh waah ooooh).
Before long, what do you know (aaaah)
She is playing in a Broadway Show!
[Belting]
Broadway shooooooowwwww!

[Spoken Interlude, reporter]
The Woman in White. 
South Pacific.
Little Women.  
Amazing Grace.  
Evita. 
[key change, dramatic build up]
The Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder. 
Honeymoon in Vegas.
Anastasia. 
Mary Poppins. 
The Music Man.
[Pause for effect]
FROZEN FROZEN FROZEN YAAAYYYY!!!

[Break, female narrator, Brooklyn accent]
Oh my God I love Frozen so much, what the FUCK is wrong with you?

[Chorus]
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh,
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind.
She’s my favorite, my best friend, my other half,
She makes a mess, but I don't mind. 

[Verse 4]
After The Music Man was over
it was time to go (to goooo)
It was fuck this shit o’clock 
she didn’t want another show (fuck this shiiiit)
So now she’s teaching,
And doing really great 
All the boys and girls 
Call her PROFESSOR ABATE!

[percussion break]

[Verse 5]
Cookie calls her “Not Dad,” but that's ok.
Because she loves her anyway (woof woof woof woof!).
She’s stylish, beautiful, short, and loud.
With long hair flowing, standing proud.

[pre chorus, key change]
Standing proooouuud!

[Chorus]
She’s fun and pretty and makes me laugh.
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind.
She’s my favorite, my best friend, my other half.
She makes a mess, but I don't mind.

[Outro]
She’s my Space Jam partner.
She’s my girl 
She's my bestest buddy in the whole wide world. 
She makes me happy when I’m sad. 
Stomps her feet when she gets mad 
She sings me songs, tells me jokes and tells me stories. 
She snores like a baby gorilla. 
She has a lot of cool shoes.
She has enormous jugs and a big butt. 
[pause]
And she’s my wife. 
[pause]
YAAAY!
[cheers and applause]

[END]
