NEPQ (Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning) situation questions are designed to help you gather information about your prospect's current circumstances, allowing you to better understand their needs and challenges. These questions are crucial for discovering the prospect's existing situation and setting the stage for further exploration of problems, impacts, and solutions.

Here are some examples of NEPQ situation questions:

1. **Can you walk me through what you're currently doing to [achieve goal/solve problem]?**
2. **How long have you been using this approach?**
3. **What led you to choose this solution in the first place?**
4. **How is that working for you so far?**
5. **What are your main goals or objectives this year?**
6. **Who is involved in the decision-making process for projects like this?**
7. **How do you typically measure success with [current process or solution]?**
8. **What challenges are you facing with your current approach?**
9. **Have there been any recent changes in your [business/department/team] that could affect this?**
10. **Is there anything about your current solution that you wish was different?**

These questions aim to understand the prospect’s existing methods and conditions before delving deeper into problem identification. They're typically low-pressure questions, intended to get the prospect to open up without feeling like they're being sold to directly.

Several sales methodologies share similarities with NEPQ (Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning) in that they focus on understanding the prospect's needs, motivations, and emotional drivers to build rapport and create value-based solutions. Here are a few that are similar in approach:

1. **SPIN Selling** – This methodology emphasizes asking four types of questions: Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-Payoff. Like NEPQ, SPIN aims to uncover the prospect's situation and problems and highlight the impact of those problems before offering a solution.

2. **Sandler Selling System** – Sandler uses a questioning approach to uncover pain points (the emotional reason behind why a prospect might buy). It focuses on understanding the prospect’s decision-making process and ensuring a good fit, which aligns with NEPQ's focus on emotional drivers and decision triggers.

3. **Challenger Sale** – This approach encourages salespeople to teach, tailor, and take control of the conversation. It shares common ground with NEPQ by asking questions to challenge the status quo and leading the prospect to think differently about their situation, which can evoke emotional responses that drive decisions.

4. **Solution Selling** – Similar to NEPQ, Solution Selling involves identifying the prospect's pain points and providing a tailored solution to their specific needs. The methodology places emphasis on understanding and solving the prospect’s problems rather than just pushing products.

5. **Consultative Selling** – This is a relationship-based sales strategy focused on the prospect’s needs and the value your product or service brings to their specific situation. Like NEPQ, it uses questioning to explore the customer’s challenges and align solutions with their emotional and business needs.

6. **MEDDIC/MEDPICC** – This methodology focuses on qualification and uses a set of criteria to assess a deal's likelihood of success. Similar to NEPQ, MEDDIC uses detailed questioning to understand the prospect’s metrics, decision-making processes, and pain points, guiding the sales process.

Each of these methodologies shares NEPQ's emphasis on discovery, emotional connection, and questioning to uncover deeper insights and build value for the prospect, but with slight variations in their frameworks and specific techniques.

I’m in sales and I want a solution that allows me to enter deals and take notes for every separate deal and upload docs etc and then turn them into to do items. My CRM is salesforce and does a poor job at this. I have Todoist but having the whole project treated as a to do list doesn’t work for me. I’ve tried Evernote but I just don’t like it and I don’t like one note either. Is there something out there?  I’d like it to be cross platform iOS and windows

**Assistant:**

Given your ADHD, finding a tool that minimizes distractions while keeping things simple and organized is crucial. Here are a few recommendations with that in mind:

### 1. **Notion**
   - **Why it might work:** Notion’s highly customizable interface can be tailored to show you only the information you need at any given time, reducing cognitive overload. You can create templates, set priorities, and focus views for individual deals or tasks, helping you stay organized.
   - **Why it might not:** Its vast array of features can sometimes be overwhelming if not structured properly. You’d need to put in some time upfront to create a simplified workflow that works for you.
   - **Best for:** People who want full control over how they manage information but can also handle a bit of customization to tailor the experience.

### 2. **ClickUp**
   - **Why it might work:** ClickUp offers multiple views (like lists, boards, and calendars), and you can use the "focus mode" to limit what you see. It’s customizable but has templates and features like reminders to help keep you on task. The simple to-do list view can help avoid distractions.
   - **Why it might not:** ClickUp can still feel overwhelming due to its numerous features, so like Notion, you’d need to strip it down to avoid distraction.
   - **Best for:** Individuals who want multiple views and task reminders but need help staying focused on one project at a time.

### 3. **Bear**
   - **Why it might work:** Bear is minimalistic and focuses on note-taking without clutter. It’s easy to organize notes into tags and links, making it distraction-free. It’s simple, clean, and great if you need an environment where you can quickly take notes without extra features in your face.
   - **Why it might not:** It’s more focused on writing and note-taking than project management, so if you need to organize more complex deal-related tasks, it might not offer enough structure.
   - **Best for:** Those who need a minimalist, no-frills environment for taking notes and reducing cognitive load.

### 4. **Trello**
   - **Why it might work:** Trello’s visual approach with boards and cards can help you break tasks into manageable chunks, and you can limit what you see at any given time, making it ADHD-friendly. The ability to hide irrelevant cards/columns is helpful in maintaining focus on current tasks.
   - **Why it might not:** If you prefer more linear structures, the board-based layout could become a distraction if not carefully managed.
   - **Best for:** People who prefer visual cues and need a simple, kanban-style layout.

### 5. **Things 3 (iOS & Mac Only)**
   - **Why it might work:** Things 3 is specifically designed with a focus on simplicity and has a great "Today" view that shows only the most important tasks. It’s incredibly clean and intuitive, with minimal distractions. It’s designed to be ADHD-friendly by helping you focus on immediate tasks and keeping the interface free of clutter.
   - **Why it might not:** It’s not available on Windows, which might be limiting for you.
   - **Best for:** Mac and iOS users who need a highly focused, clean interface.

### 6. **Taskade**
   - **Why it might work:** Taskade offers a clean interface with simple task lists, and its ability to turn any note into a task list can help with staying on top of deals. It’s minimal yet has enough features to manage tasks effectively without overwhelming you.
   - **Why it might not:** Like some of the others, it requires initial setup to make sure it doesn’t become too complex.
   - **Best for:** Individuals who need simplicity and like the mix of task management and note-taking.

### Recommended for ADHD:
- **Things 3 (if you're on Mac/iOS)** for its clean, focused interface designed to reduce distraction.
- **Bear** for minimalist note-taking without distractions.
- **Trello** if visual organization works for your brain, especially if breaking tasks into cards helps.

For cross-platform use, **ClickUp** and **Notion** are excellent but require careful customization to avoid cognitive overload. **Taskade** is another cross-platform, simple solution to consider. 

Finding what works will ultimately depend on whether you respond better to minimalism or customization!
