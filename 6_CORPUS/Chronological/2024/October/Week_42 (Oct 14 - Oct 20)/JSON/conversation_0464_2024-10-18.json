            "In Delaware, every solar installer working on a job site does **not** necessarily need to hold an individual license. However, the company installing solar systems must be licensed, and at least one person on the job site must be a licensed electrician. The key is ensuring that the electrical work, which is a crucial part of solar installations, is supervised by a licensed electrician as required by the Delaware Board of Electrical Examiners.\n\nDelaware\u2019s regulations require solar installers to meet certain licensing standards, but they focus mainly on the electrical aspects of the installation. If your solar company holds a license, and you have a licensed electrician overseeing the project, other installers can assist under their supervision without holding individual licenses. \n\nIf you\u2019re hiring subcontractors, make sure they are working under the proper permits and licenses to avoid any compliance issues. It\u2019s always a good idea to check with local authorities or the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation for the most current licensing requirements."

If I am an employee of a company, school district or state agency, do I need a license to do electrical work for my employer?\n  8. Is there a grandfather period (an exam waiver period) for Residential Electrician application?\n\n## Answers\n\nDo I need a license to work in Delaware if I am licensed in another state?\n\nAnswer:  Yes. The Delaware Board of Electrical Examiners must issue you a license to work in Delaware.\n\nHow do I apply for licensure?\n\nAnswer:\u00a0You can apply for a license at any time through DELPROS, our online portal. First, read the instructions and requirements for the type of Electrical license you need on our website. \u00a0When you have gathered all the information and documentation required to apply for a license, you may click on any one of the many convenient links throughout the website to get into \u301015\u2020DELPROS\u2020delpros.delaware.gov\u3011 online portal and follow the instructions through the process. You just need your user account to log in, complete the application, upload your supporting documents, and pay the fee with a credit/debit card. We will send you email notifications throughout the application process. When approved, we will notify you that you may print your license.\n\nDo you have reciprocity?\n\nAnswer: Yes. If you are currently licensed\u00a0by another\u00a0juridiction (state, U.S. territory or District of Columbia), \u00a0you may apply by reciprocity. The requirements vary depending on whether any\u00a0jurisdiction where you hold a current license has licensure standards that are substantially similar to Delaware\u2019s standards. If your current license\u00a0was issued by a jurisdiction\u00a0where the standards are not substantially similar to Delaware\u2019s standards, you must provide proof of practice for at least five years after licensure. For complete instructions, see \u301042\u2020Licensure Requirements\u3011.\n\nHow long does the licensure process take?\n\nAnswer: With DELPROS, our online professional portal, the application processing is very efficient. However, the amount of time it takes varies based on how quickly the application and all supporting documents are submitted and considered \u201ccomplete\u201d. When the application is complete, it is reviewed for approval of licensure on or before the next Board meeting. The meeting schedule is available on the State of Delaware \u301060\u2020public meeting calendar\u2020publicmeetings.delaware.gov\u3011.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for licensure?\n\nAnswer: See \u301061\u2020 Fee Schedule\u3011.\n\nWhom do I contact with questions\u00a0about the current electrical code used in Delaware?\n\nAnswer:  The State Fire Marshall\u2019s Office adopts, with amendments, the version of the National Electrical Code (NEC) used in Delaware (e.g. 2008). This is not available online.\n\nLicensed Delaware electrical inspection agencies use the current NEC as adopted by the State Fire Marshall\u2019s Office to perform inspections in Delaware. Contact a licensed electrical inspection agency with any questions about the electrical code. The list of licensed Inspection Agencies are located on the Homeowner Permit webpage\u00a0.\n\nIf I am an employee of a company, school district or state agency, do I need a license to do electrical work for my employer?\n\nAnswer: Generally, you must have an electrical license even if you are doing electrical work only for your employer. However, see 24 Del. C. \u00a71419 in the\u00a0\u301062\u2020License Law\u2020delcode.delaware.gov\u3011 for a list of exceptions.\n\nIs there a grandfather period (an exam waiver period) for Residential Electrician application?\n\nAnswer:  Yes, however, the March 1, 2019 deadline for this period has passed. For more information, see Section 5 of \u301063\u2020 24 Del. C.

            "In Delaware, for solar installation projects, not every installer needs to be individually licensed. However, the key requirement is that the **company** performing the installation must be licensed, and any electrical work must be supervised by a licensed electrician. At least one licensed electrician (either a Master or Journeyperson) must be present on-site to oversee the project. Additionally, all electrical work related to the solar installation must comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC) as adopted by Delaware.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation's website, which provides detailed guidelines on the licensing process and requirements for electricians and solar installations\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301012\u2020source\u3011."

If the only current license(s) you hold was issued by a Pennsylvania municipality or other jurisdiction, you must apply by examination.  \n\n  * Apply by reciprocity if you hold a current license of the same type for which you are now applying that was issued by another state, U.S. territory or District of Columbia.\n\n##   \nInformation on How to Apply for a License in DELPROS\n\nAll applications are submitted our online system DELPROS. We no longer accept paper applications. \n\n####   \nPRIOR TO APPLYING \n\nIn order to apply for a license or submit a service request, you must first have a \u301060\u2020DELPROS\u2020delpros.delaware.gov\u3011 user account. To LOG IN or CREATE a DELPROS (Delaware Professional Regulation Online Services) user account:\n\n  1. Go to: \u301061\u2020https://delpros.delaware.gov/OH_HomePage\u2020delpros.delaware.gov\u3011.\n  2. Click GO  on the Apply/Manage a License and Service Requests  tile.\n  3. If you do not have a DELPROS user account, click the REGISTER button on the  left  side of page for NEW USERS. \n  4. If you already have a DELPROS user account, enter your email address and password on the  right side for  EXISTING USERS and click the LOGIN button.\n\nDELPROS allows you to save your incomplete application and return to it later to finish the process. You only have six (6) months to submit your application once you begin. \n\n  * If you do not submit your application within six months of starting it, you will be required to restart the entire online application again.\n\nYou may check the status of your application online throughout the entire application process by using the \u201cView Application Status\u201d feature in DELPROS on your e-License dashboard.\n\n####   \nKNOW YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND COLLECT YOUR DOCUMENTS\n\n  1. Know the requirements for the license you are pursuing. \n     * For more information on the requirements for licensure, refer to your profession\u2019s \u301056\u2020License Law\u2020delcode.delaware.gov\u3011 and \u301062\u2020Rules and Regulations\u2020regulations.delaware.gov\u3011.\n  2. Request and gather all documents required to upload on the Attachments page. All information and forms are located on your profession\u2019s webpages.\n\n####   \nATTACHING AND ACKNOWLEDGING DOCUMENTS \n\nOn the ATTACHMENTS page of your application, you may be instructed to:\n\n  * either  \u201cattach\u201d or \u201cupload\u201d  the required document(s) directly to your application. This means you will find the document(s) saved on your computer or device and upload it to your application.\n\n  * click  \u201cacknowledge\u201d . This means you will either have to mail the documents yourself or request the \u201cthird-party\u201d mail the document(s) directly to the Board office. \n    * Examples of \u201cthird-party forms\u201d are transcripts from schools, employment verifications from a supervisor, and license verifications from another state.\n  * Forms requiring a supervisor signature, seal, or notary may have to be  MAILED  to the Board office directly UNLESS the document specifically indicates to UPLOAD the document.\n\nThe requirements for this license type are provided in the following section(s).\n\n##   \nRequirements for All Applicants\n\nIn addition to submitting the application and fee in DELPROS, you must submit:\n\n  * Proof of general liability insurance of at least $300,000. Your name must be on the insurance document you submit even if your employer holds the policy. \n    * If your employer carries general liability insurance of at least $300,000.00 covering its employees, the proof you submit must show that you are covered by your employer\u2019s policy. (See Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the Board\u2019s \u301055\u2020Rules and Regulations\u2020regulations.delaware.gov\u3011.)\n    * You may take the exam before submitting proof of insurance, but you must submit it after you pass. Your license cannot be issued until the Board office receives proof of insurance.\n\n  * State/Jurisdiction Licensure Verification sent directly to the Board office from each state or jurisdiction in which you currently hold or have ever held a license. \n    * If the license issued by another jurisdiction was a license for an electrical business that encompassed all its employees, instead of your own license as an individual, it is not necessary to obtain a license verification for that business.\n\n##   \nAdditional Requirements for Examination Applicants\n\nIf you need to take the examination for an original license, the Board of Electrical Examiners must approve you to sit for the examination. You must submit the supporting documentation below at least 45 days before the scheduled test date (Section 4.0 of the Board\u2019s \u301055\u2020 Rules and Regulations.\u2020regulations.delaware.gov\u3011)\n\nIn addition to submitting the application, fee, and supporting documentation required in the previous section, in DELPROS, you must also submit the following:\n\n  *     * Proof of experience. The experience requirement depends on which kind of license you are applying for (Master, Limited or any Special license)and if you have or have not completed a registered/approved Apprenticeship program of any state, U.S. territory or D.C.\n      * If you have completed a registered/approved apprenticeship program and you are applying for Master, Limited or any Special license,  you only need a copy of your Certificate of Completion of Apprenticeship.\n      * If you have not completed a registered/approved Apprenticeship program and you are applying for Master, Limited or any Special license,  submit a  \u301063\u2020Verification of Employment\u2020dprfiles.delaware.gov\u3011 form from each employer.
