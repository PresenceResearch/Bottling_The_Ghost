How are grants calculated 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-16 12:56:26*

Grants for the **Maryland Solar for All** program, particularly for developers, are generally calculated based on several factors to ensure that projects meet the program’s goals of providing affordable solar energy to low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. The grants are typically aimed at covering the additional costs of ensuring that these projects benefit LMI communities. Here's how the calculation of grants is typically structured:

### 1. **Project Size and Capacity**
   - The size of the grant is often proportional to the size of the project. For example, larger projects (e.g., 2 MW to 5 MW) may receive larger grants, since they serve more households and require more resources to develop and maintain.
   - Some grants are calculated based on a per-watt or per-kilowatt (kW) basis, where developers receive a certain amount of funding for every watt of solar capacity installed in the project that serves LMI participants.

### 2. **LMI Subscriber Proportion**
   - A key factor in grant calculations is the proportion of LMI subscribers in the community solar project. Developers who allocate a larger percentage of their solar capacity to LMI households may be eligible for larger grants.
   - For example, if 51% of the project’s energy is dedicated to LMI subscribers (the minimum threshold), the grant amount would reflect the cost associated with supporting this subscriber base. Projects with a higher percentage, such as 75% or more, might receive a higher level of grant support.
   
### 3. **Cost Differentials for LMI Participation**
   - Grants are often calculated to cover the **incremental costs** of serving LMI households. This includes the costs of:
     - **Outreach and recruitment**: Finding and onboarding LMI subscribers, which may require more effort and collaboration with community organizations.
     - **Subscriber management**: Additional administrative costs related to maintaining the LMI subscriber base, such as helping with financial assessments and ensuring compliance with income eligibility.
     - **Reducing upfront costs**: Grants help to ensure that LMI subscribers face no upfront costs, by covering the difference between market costs and what LMI households can afford to pay.
   
### 4. **Savings to LMI Subscribers**
   - Grants may also be calculated based on the savings passed on to LMI subscribers. Developers who are able to offer greater savings (e.g., a 25% reduction in energy costs) to LMI households may receive larger grants, as the goal is to maximize economic benefits for low-income participants.
   - Grants could be designed to ensure that developers can provide a guaranteed percentage reduction in energy rates for LMI customers compared to standard utility rates.

### 5. **Geographic Location and Impact**
   - Projects in underserved areas or regions with higher energy burdens (where households spend a larger proportion of their income on energy costs) may receive higher grant awards. The MEA may target certain counties or areas where access to affordable energy is a significant issue.
   - Developers proposing projects in these targeted areas could be eligible for additional funding to help address regional disparities in energy access.

### 6. **Additional Costs for Permits and Infrastructure**
   - The grant may also account for **non-recurring costs**, such as permits, interconnection fees, and necessary upgrades to infrastructure (e.g., transmission and distribution system improvements). Grants might cover a portion of these costs to reduce the financial burden on the developer and ensure the feasibility of the project.

### 7. **Application of Incentives and Tax Credits**
   - Developers may also be eligible for federal tax incentives, such as the **Investment Tax Credit (ITC)** for solar projects, which can reduce the overall cost of the project. However, grants under the Maryland Solar for All program are generally **designed to work in tandem with other incentives**, not to replace them.
   - The size of the grant could be adjusted based on the total financial package, including how much developers are able to secure from other state or federal incentive programs. This ensures that state funds are used efficiently without duplicating benefits.

### 8. **Tiered Funding Structure**
   - Some grant programs use a tiered structure, offering varying levels of support depending on the complexity and impact of the project. For example, a project that integrates energy storage, such as batteries, to increase energy resilience for LMI communities may be eligible for a higher level of funding.

### Example of Grant Calculation:
Let’s say a developer is building a 3 MW community solar project, where 60% of the project’s capacity will serve LMI subscribers. The grant could be calculated as follows:
- **Base Funding per kW**: If the grant offers $300 per kW of installed capacity, the total grant for a 3 MW project would be $300 x 3,000 kW = $900,000.
- **Additional Funding for LMI Proportion**: If the project serves 60% LMI households, there could be a bonus of $100 per kW for that capacity. For 60% of 3 MW (1.8 MW or 1,800 kW), the additional grant would be $100 x 1,800 kW = $180,000.
- **Total Grant**: The total grant in this scenario would be $900,000 + $180,000 = $1,080,000.

### Conclusion
The exact methodology for calculating grants may vary based on the specific program and funding available, but they generally reflect the scale of the project, the proportion of LMI participation, and the additional costs associated with serving low-income households. To get specific details, project developers should consult with the Maryland Energy Administration and review the most current grant application guidelines for the Maryland Solar for All program.

User is interested in the impact of PJM 2025-2026 capacity prices on electricity prices for BGE customers.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-16 13:30:57*

The **PJM 2025-2026 capacity prices** will influence the overall cost of electricity for **Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE)** customers, primarily through changes in capacity charges on their bills. PJM Interconnection, which manages the wholesale electricity market for much of the eastern U.S., including Maryland, sets capacity prices to ensure that there is enough generation available to meet future demand. Here’s how these prices could affect BGE customers:

### 1. **Capacity Costs**: 
   Capacity prices reflect the costs paid to power generators to ensure that they can meet peak demand, especially during extreme weather or other high-demand situations. These costs are passed on to utilities like BGE, which then include them in their customers' rates.

   - **Higher Capacity Prices**: If PJM sets higher capacity prices for 2025-2026, it means BGE will pay more to secure enough capacity, and these costs will likely be passed down to customers in the form of higher rates. This would result in an increase in the capacity portion of BGE customers' bills.
   - **Lower Capacity Prices**: Conversely, if capacity prices decrease, BGE’s costs for securing capacity will fall, potentially leading to lower electricity prices for customers.

### 2. **Effect on Retail Electricity Rates**:
   BGE’s electricity rates are influenced by wholesale market costs, including capacity, energy, and transmission charges. The capacity component of electricity rates typically accounts for a significant portion of the overall cost, especially for commercial and industrial customers, but also for residential customers.

   - For **residential customers**, capacity charges are embedded within the standard service rates that BGE charges. As PJM capacity prices fluctuate, BGE may adjust its rates accordingly, leading to potential increases or decreases in retail electricity prices.
   - **Commercial and industrial customers** who participate in demand response programs or have negotiated capacity payments may see more direct changes in their energy costs based on PJM’s capacity prices.

### 3. **Market Dynamics and Policy Changes**:
   The PJM capacity market is also affected by regulatory decisions and energy market reforms. These factors could influence capacity prices and, in turn, electricity prices for BGE customers. For example, policies that promote renewable energy or grid modernization may reduce the need for traditional capacity, potentially lowering prices.

### 4. **Impact of Supply and Demand**:
   Capacity prices are set in PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) auctions, where generators offer their capacity based on supply and demand expectations. If PJM anticipates higher demand or less supply for 2025-2026, capacity prices could rise, affecting electricity rates for BGE customers. Factors like plant retirements, new renewable energy capacity, and demand-side resources can influence the auction outcomes.

### 5. **Timing of Changes**:
   The effects of the 2025-2026 capacity prices on electricity rates may not be immediate. BGE will likely incorporate these prices into their rates when the capacity year begins, potentially leading to adjustments in customer bills starting in mid-2025.

In summary, PJM’s 2025-2026 capacity prices will directly affect BGE’s cost of providing electricity, potentially leading to changes in customer rates, with higher prices leading to higher bills and lower prices providing relief. Monitoring BGE’s rate filings with the Maryland Public Service Commission can provide more specific information on the impact for individual customers.
