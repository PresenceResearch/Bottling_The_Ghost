**Assistant:**

*2024-10-17 15:44:03*

The average override for a sales manager typically ranges from 2% to 10% of the sales made by their team, depending on the industry and company structure. For industries with higher margins, such as software or technology, it might be closer to the higher end of that range. In lower-margin industries, like some retail or consumer goods sectors, it may fall on the lower side. Some companies also offer tiered override percentages based on team performance or hitting specific sales targets.

Do you have a particular industry or sales model in mind for a more specific range?
