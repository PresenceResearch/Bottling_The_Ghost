To insert guitar riffs during verses in your song, you can use the tag **[Guitar riff]** alongside the [Verse] tag to indicate where you want the guitar riff to be integrated. Here's how it would look in the structure of your lyrics:

```text
[Verse][Guitar riff]
lyrics with guitar riffs weaving in between lines
more lyrics, then the guitar riff takes over for a few seconds
```

This will help indicate that a guitar riff should be played at specific moments during the verse. You can adjust the placement and intensity based on your song's needs, using this notation throughout the verses where the riff is to be included.

Yes, you can absolutely say "guitar riff between lines" to describe where you want the guitar riff to be placed within the verse. It’s a natural way to communicate that you want the riff to play between the lyrical lines. Here's how you could incorporate that phrasing:

```text
[Verse]
lyrics line 1
[guitar riff between lines]
lyrics line 2
[guitar riff between lines]
lyrics line 3
```

This clearly indicates where the guitar riff should occur between each line of lyrics. Feel free to adjust this based on the flow and structure of your song!
