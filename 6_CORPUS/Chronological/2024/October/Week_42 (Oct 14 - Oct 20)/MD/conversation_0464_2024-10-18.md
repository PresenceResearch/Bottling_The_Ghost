In Delaware, every solar installer working on a job site does **not** necessarily need to hold an individual license. However, the company installing solar systems must be licensed, and at least one person on the job site must be a licensed electrician. The key is ensuring that the electrical work, which is a crucial part of solar installations, is supervised by a licensed electrician as required by the Delaware Board of Electrical Examiners.

Delaware’s regulations require solar installers to meet certain licensing standards, but they focus mainly on the electrical aspects of the installation. If your solar company holds a license, and you have a licensed electrician overseeing the project, other installers can assist under their supervision without holding individual licenses. 

If you’re hiring subcontractors, make sure they are working under the proper permits and licenses to avoid any compliance issues. It’s always a good idea to check with local authorities or the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation for the most current licensing requirements.

In Delaware, for solar installation projects, not every installer needs to be individually licensed. However, the key requirement is that the **company** performing the installation must be licensed, and any electrical work must be supervised by a licensed electrician. At least one licensed electrician (either a Master or Journeyperson) must be present on-site to oversee the project. Additionally, all electrical work related to the solar installation must comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC) as adopted by Delaware.
