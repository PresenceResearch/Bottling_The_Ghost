has this passed in Delaware?  Proposed changes:  5.6.2 Education and Licensure
Participating contractors shall maintain appropriate education and licenses to insure that only professionally designed systems are installed within the Program. The contractor must maintain on staff field personal that have received appropriate training for the installation of that particular renewable energy system. Each contractor must submit annually a list of personnel on staff that has received the appropriate training to qualify them to conduct the installation of renewable energy systems. The Participating contractor must be licensed in the State of Delaware. Copies of all renewed licenses must be submitted to the department within 60 days of expiration. If all new licenses are not provided, the contractor will be suspended from participation with the Green Energy Program until a new license is provided. All installations performed during the suspension will not be eligible for funds until the suspension is lifted.

Where industry certification programs have been promulgated, grant recipients will be required to obtain the highest industry recognized training within three (3) years of becoming an approved contractor. Thereafter the contractor must continue to become certified in the highest industry recognized training every three (3) years. If a new certificate is not provided, the contractor will be suspended from participation with the Green Energy Program until a new certificate is provided. All installations performed during the suspension will not be eligible for funds until the suspension is lifted.

The proposed changes regarding contractor education and licensure requirements for Delaware's Green Energy Program have not yet been officially passed into law. These changes, which mandate that contractors maintain relevant training, submit licenses, and obtain industry-recognized certifications every three years, are part of ongoing regulatory updates aimed at improving the quality and oversight of renewable energy installations within the state. The new rules would suspend contractors who fail to comply with these requirements until they provide the necessary documentation. 

However, Delaware has recently passed other environmental and energy-related legislation, such as the Delaware Energy Solutions Act of 2024, which focuses on renewable energy infrastructure, but no specific update confirming the adoption of the particular licensure requirements you mentioned has been documented as of now【7†source】【8†source】. 

For the most current status, it might be helpful to check directly with Delaware's Division of Climate, Coastal, and Energy or the DNREC Green Energy Program.
