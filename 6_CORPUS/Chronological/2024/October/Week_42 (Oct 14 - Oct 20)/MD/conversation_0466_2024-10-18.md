In Pakistan, it's difficult to get precise numbers, but around sixty percent of students complete their secondary education (equivalent to high school). However, the dropout rate is quite high in rural areas, and many students don’t make it to higher secondary education (grades eleven and twelve). The literacy rate also varies widely across regions, with urban areas generally having better access to education than rural ones. Do you need more detailed stats on this?
