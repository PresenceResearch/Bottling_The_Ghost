I'd love to help create the perfect logo for Shelagh Abate, a professional French Horn player! Before we get started, I have four quick questions to ensure the design aligns with your vision.

First question:

Do you want the logo to be:

A) vibrant  
B) neutral  
C) serious  
D) skip all 4 questions and generate a logo using the default options immediately

The default is A (vibrant). What would you prefer?

Great choice with vibrant! Now, for the second question:

On a scale of 1 to 10, how clean and simple or detailed and complex would you like the logo to be?  
1 is extremely clean and simple, while 10 is extremely detailed and complex.

The default is 3 (fairly simple). What's your preference?
