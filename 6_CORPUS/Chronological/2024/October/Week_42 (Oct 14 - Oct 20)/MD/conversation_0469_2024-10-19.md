This appears to be an RCA Victrola vinyl recording of Johannes Brahms' **Symphony No. 1 in C Minor, Op. 68** and **Academic Festival Overture, Op. 80**, performed by the **NBC Symphony Orchestra** under the direction of the legendary conductor **Arturo Toscanini**. 

RCA Victrola was a budget label created by RCA in the 1950s to reissue classic recordings, often featuring renowned conductors and orchestras. Toscanini was one of the most famous conductors of the 20th century, known for his precise and passionate interpretations of both classical and romantic repertoire. The NBC Symphony Orchestra was specifically created for Toscanini by NBC, and they made many acclaimed recordings together, particularly of Brahms' works.

This particular recording is likely in mono (as noted on the label), which suggests it was produced before stereo became the standard for music recordings, likely in the 1950s. Brahms' Symphony No. 1 is a cornerstone of the symphonic repertoire, and Toscanini's interpretation of it is considered one of the definitive recordings of its time.

The exact year of this recording would depend on the specific release, but Arturo Toscanini recorded Brahms' **Symphony No. 1 in C Minor, Op. 68** with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in **1951**. RCA Victrola, the label on your record, was introduced later as a budget reissue label in **1958**, so the pressing you have was likely released sometime after that, possibly in the late 1950s or early 1960s.

If you're looking for the precise year for this particular RCA Victrola release, it might be necessary to check the matrix numbers or consult a detailed discography of Toscanini's recordings, as RCA Victrola often reissued the same recordings multiple times.

The French horn section of the **NBC Symphony Orchestra** during the early 1950s, when Toscanini recorded Brahms' **Symphony No. 1**, was composed of some of the best horn players of that era. The principal horn player was **Arthur Berv**, who was widely regarded for his powerful and precise playing.

Here’s a list of some of the key horn players who were part of the orchestra around that time:

1. **Arthur Berv** – Principal Horn
   - Berv was known for his exceptional control, rich tone, and mastery of orchestral horn playing. He played with Toscanini for many years and was considered one of the top horn players of his generation.

2. **Alfred Lansford** – Horn
   - Lansford was a notable horn player in the section and a respected musician in orchestral circles.

3. **James Chambers** – Horn (Occasional)
   - Although primarily known for his work with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Chambers occasionally played with the NBC Symphony and was one of the foremost horn players of his time.

4. **Bruno Jaenicke** – Horn
   - Jaenicke was a veteran horn player with a significant orchestral career. He was another essential part of the NBC Symphony's horn section.

These players formed one of the finest horn sections in the world under Toscanini’s baton. The clarity, balance, and intensity of their sound were critical to the orchestra’s overall performance style, especially in demanding works like Brahms’ symphonies.
