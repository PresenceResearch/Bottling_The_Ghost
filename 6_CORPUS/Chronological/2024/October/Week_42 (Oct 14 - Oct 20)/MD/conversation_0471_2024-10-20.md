Congrats on quitting Zyn pouches! You can try brands like Grinds or ON! that make nicotine-free pouches. Grinds, for example, is a popular option with pouches infused with caffeine instead of nicotine. They come in different flavors like mint, vanilla, or coffee, so it can still give you something to chew on. Another option is Fully Loaded Chew, which offers a range of nicotine-free pouches with flavors that simulate the experience without any nicotine. These might help with the habit without the addictive part.
