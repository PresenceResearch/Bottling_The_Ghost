The approximate mg conversion ratio between Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) and Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) can vary slightly depending on individual response, but a common conversion guideline is:

- 30 mg of Vyvanse is roughly equivalent to 10 mg of Adderall IR (immediate release).

So, the general ratio is about 3:1 (Vyvanse: Adderall), meaning it takes about 3 mg of Vyvanse to equal 1 mg of Adderall.

However, because Vyvanse is a prodrug (it gets converted into the active form in the body more gradually), it typically has a longer-lasting effect compared to Adderall. The actual effect can vary depending on factors like metabolism and how each person processes the medication. Always consult a doctor for precise dosage adjustments and advice.

For extended-release Adderall (Adderall XR), the comparison with Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) is similar to the immediate-release form but with the extended duration in mind.

- 30 mg of Vyvanse is generally considered equivalent to **10-15 mg of Adderall XR**.

Vyvanse has a duration of action that typically lasts 10-12 hours, which is comparable to Adderall XR, which also lasts about 10-12 hours depending on the individual. The general conversion ratio (3:1) remains similar for Vyvanse to Adderall XR, but because of the gradual release mechanisms in both medications, the experience might feel different in terms of how the effects build and taper off.

Again, individual response can vary, and it's important to consult with a healthcare provider when adjusting between these medications.

There is limited research on the interaction between Chantix (varenicline) and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine), so it’s essential to be cautious. Here's a breakdown of potential considerations:

1. **Chantix (varenicline)** is primarily used to help people quit smoking by affecting nicotinic receptors in the brain. Its common side effects include nausea, vivid dreams, and sometimes mood changes.
   
2. **Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine)** is a stimulant used to treat ADHD and binge-eating disorder. Common side effects include increased heart rate, anxiety, and trouble sleeping.

### Potential Concerns:
- **Mood and Anxiety**: Chantix has been reported to cause mood changes, irritability, and in rare cases, worsening depression or anxiety. Vyvanse can also cause anxiety or exacerbate pre-existing mood disorders, so there’s a potential for these effects to be magnified when taken together.
- **Cardiovascular Effects**: Vyvanse increases heart rate and blood pressure. Chantix is generally not known to have significant cardiovascular side effects, but if you have underlying heart conditions, it's worth discussing with a doctor.
- **Sleep Issues**: Both medications can cause disturbances in sleep (insomnia from Vyvanse and vivid dreams from Chantix), which could be problematic when taken together.

Since both drugs can have overlapping side effects on mood and anxiety, combining them could potentially intensify these effects. It’s crucial to consult a healthcare provider to weigh the risks and benefits of taking them together and to monitor for any changes in mood or other side effects if you're using both.
