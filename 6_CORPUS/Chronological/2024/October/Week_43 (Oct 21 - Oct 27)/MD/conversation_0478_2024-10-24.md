**This Program replaces the solar portion of the now-discontinued Commercial Clean Energy Rebate Program.**

Program Purpose: The Maryland Energy Administration Commercial Solar Grant Program ("CSGP", "the Program") will provide grants for solar PV systems installed at Maryland businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations, that will be owned by or directly benefit (1) low-to-moderate income communities located in a census tract with an average median income at or below 80% of the average median income for the State, or (2) overburdened or underserved communities, as defined by §1-701 of the Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. These solar PV systems can help reduce organizational operational costs and improve their sustainability, which can help them better serve the communities that surround them. Solar PV systems are excellent solutions for organizations that seek to free up capital for other expenses and projects, expand operations and offerings sustainably, and help Maryland meet its clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals. This is especially important for Maryland businesses and other organizations that have historically been disadvantaged, overburdened, and underserved. The Commercial Solar Grant Program will provide more equitable and more meaningful incentives to achieve these objectives under two (2) Areas of Interest:

Area of Interest 1 - Equitable Solar Access for Organizations: Grants for businesses and other organizations that are registered to operate in Maryland that have been designated as, or are actively in the process of being designated as, a Small Business Enterprise, Minority Business Enterprise, Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Enterprise, or Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, by the Maryland Department of Transportation Office of Minority Business Enterprise; or are Veteran- or Disabled Veteran-Owned.

Area of Interest 2 - Commercial Solar for Sustainability​: Grants for businesses and other organizations with substantial energy needs that can benefit from larger-scale solar PV installations to reduce their energy costs and improve sustainability of their operations.
Type of Program:         Noncompetitive, awarded on a First-Come, First-Served basis

Program Application Deadline:          3:00 P.M. ET, Monday, March 31, 2025

Funding: A total of up to $5,000,000 is expected to be available, with initial reservations for each AOI:

AOI 1 - Equitable Solar Access for Organizations: $3,000,000

AOI 2 - Large Commercial Solar: $2,000,000
Note: These initial funding reservations will remain in place through December 31, 2024. Beginning on January 1, 2025, all remaining funds for each AOI will be made available to all eligible applicants, regardless of AOI.

Grant Amounts: Grant amounts are based on the Area of Interest and the size of the solar PV system, on a dollar-per-kilowatt ($/kW) basis. The table below provides information on how grant amounts w​ill be calculated.

### Key Program Details:

- **Purpose:** To provide grants that help reduce operational costs for organizations, improve sustainability, and promote Maryland's clean energy goals, particularly benefiting historically disadvantaged communities.
  
- **Eligibility:** 
  - **Area of Interest 1:** Grants for organizations designated as Small Business Enterprises, Minority Business Enterprises, Veteran-Owned businesses, and similar designations.
  - **Area of Interest 2:** Grants for organizations with high energy demands that can benefit from larger-scale solar PV installations to reduce costs.

- **Program Type:** Noncompetitive, awarded on a **first-come, first-served basis**.

- **Application Deadline:** **March 31, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET.**

- **Funding:** A total of **$5,000,000** is available, with initial reservations:
  - **$3,000,000** for Area of Interest 1 (Equitable Solar Access).
  - **$2,000,000** for Area of Interest 2 (Large Commercial Solar).

- **Grant Amounts:** Based on system size, calculated on a dollar-per-kilowatt ($/kW) basis. 

Initial funding is reserved until **December 31, 2024**, after which remaining funds will be open to all eligible applicants.

can I apply for projects under construction now?

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-24 10:17:26*

Yes, you should be able to apply for projects under construction, provided they meet the eligibility requirements of the **Maryland Energy Administration Commercial Solar Grant Program**. Since the program is noncompetitive and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, as long as your project aligns with the program's purpose—such as benefiting low-to-moderate income or overburdened communities—and is located in Maryland, you should be eligible. 

It would be a good idea to contact the Maryland Energy Administration directly or review the specific guidelines for any restrictions related to construction timelines or project status at the time of application. The program may have specific requirements for how far along in the construction process a project can be when applying for funding.

The **eligibility requirements** for the **Maryland Energy Administration Commercial Solar Grant Program (CSGP)** are divided into two key areas of interest. Here’s a breakdown of the eligibility criteria for each:

### **Area of Interest 1 - Equitable Solar Access for Organizations**
- **Who can apply:**
  - Businesses and organizations **registered to operate in Maryland**.

  - These designations must be recognized by the Maryland Department of Transportation Office of Minority Business Enterprise.

### **Area of Interest 2 - Commercial Solar for Sustainability**
- **Who can apply:**
  - Businesses and other organizations in Maryland with **substantial energy needs**.
  - These organizations must be looking to install **larger-scale solar PV systems** to reduce energy costs and improve operational sustainability.

### **General Requirements for Both Areas of Interest:**
- The project must involve the installation of a **solar PV system**.
- The system must be installed on properties in Maryland and benefit businesses, nonprofits, or other organizations located within the state.
- Priority is given to projects that benefit **low-to-moderate income communities** (those in census tracts where the median income is at or below 80% of the state's average) and **overburdened or underserved communities**, as defined by Maryland state law.

### **Additional Notes:**
- Grants are awarded on a **first-come, first-served basis**.
- The funding is divided, with initial reservations of $3 million for equitable solar access and $2 million for larger commercial solar projects. These funds are reserved until **December 31, 2024**, after which all remaining funds will be available to all eligible applicants, regardless of which area of interest they fall under.
  
Make sure your organization meets the specific designation criteria if you're applying under Area of Interest 1. For Area of Interest 2, demonstrate substantial energy needs and the benefits of large-scale solar for your operations.
