is there an excel spreadsheet I can use?

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-30 11:32:29*

A downloadable Excel spreadsheet of Maryland veteran-owned businesses isn’t typically available directly online. However, here’s how you can get or create one:

1. **Veteran Owned Business Directory**: On [VeteranOwnedBusiness.com](https://www.veteranownedbusiness.com), you can search for Maryland-based businesses and export the data manually if needed. This directory doesn’t offer direct Excel downloads, but you can copy entries into a spreadsheet. Additionally, you can contact their support to see if they can provide a larger dataset.

2. **Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Database**: MDOT’s Office of Minority Business Enterprise maintains a searchable directory of certified businesses, including veteran-owned companies. You can use the **eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA)** platform to access listings and possibly request data downloads from MDOT. Visit [MDOT’s directory here](https://marylandmdbe.mdot.maryland.gov).

3. **eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA)**: This is Maryland's procurement platform where registered vendors, including veteran-owned businesses, are listed. You can contact eMMA’s support to inquire about obtaining data in Excel format if needed.

4. **Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs**: They may also have resources or contacts who can provide data for veteran-owned businesses actively registered in Maryland. Their site for small business resources is [veterans.maryland.gov](https://veterans.maryland.gov).

Alternatively, if you need help with creating a list from an existing source, I can assist with formatting once you have gathered data!
