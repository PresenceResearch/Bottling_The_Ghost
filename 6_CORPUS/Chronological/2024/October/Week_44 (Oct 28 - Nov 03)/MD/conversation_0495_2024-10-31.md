Hey Mark! Deleting apps on your Mac is pretty straightforward. Here are a few methods you can use:

**1. Using Launchpad (for apps from the App Store):**

- Click the **Launchpad** icon in your Dock (it looks like a rocket).
- Find the app you want to delete.
- Click and hold the app icon until all the icons start to jiggle.
- Click the small "X" that appears on the app's icon.
- Confirm by clicking **Delete**.

*Note:* If you don't see an "X," it means the app wasn't downloaded from the App Store.

**2. Using Finder (for all apps):**

- Open **Finder** by clicking its icon in the Dock.
- Go to the **Applications** folder.
- Locate the app you want to remove.
- Drag the app to the **Trash** in your Dock, or right-click and select **Move to Trash**.
- To permanently delete, right-click the **Trash** icon and choose **Empty Trash**.

**3. Using the App's Uninstaller:**

Some apps come with their own uninstaller.

- Open the app's folder in the **Applications** directory.
- Look for an uninstaller tool (it might be named "Uninstall [App Name]").
- Run the uninstaller and follow the on-screen instructions.

**4. Using Third-Party Tools:**

For a more thorough cleanup, especially to remove leftover files, you can use third-party apps like **AppCleaner**.

- Download and install AppCleaner from [freemacsoft.net](https://freemacsoft.net/).
- Open AppCleaner.
- Drag the app you want to delete into the AppCleaner window.
- AppCleaner will find related files; click **Remove** to delete them.

**A Few Tips:**

- Some built-in macOS apps (like Safari or Mail) can't be deleted.
- If an app is still running, make sure to quit it before trying to delete.
- Always back up important data before uninstalling apps, just in case.
