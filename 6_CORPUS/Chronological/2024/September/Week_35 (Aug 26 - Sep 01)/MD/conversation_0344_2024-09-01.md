Here's a brief synopsis of each movie:

### **The Conjuring 2 (2016)**
In this supernatural horror film, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to Enfield, London, to help a single mother and her four children, who are plagued by a malevolent spirit in their home. The haunting centers around the youngest daughter, Janet, who becomes the main target of the sinister entity. As the Warrens delve deeper into the case, they uncover a terrifying connection to one of their past investigations. The film is based on the real-life Enfield poltergeist case and is filled with suspense, jump scares, and eerie atmospheres typical of "The Conjuring" franchise.

### **Tarot (2020)**
"Tarot" is a lesser-known supernatural thriller centered around a group of friends who play with a tarot card deck that they discover in an abandoned house. As they delve into the game, they unknowingly awaken dark forces connected to the deck's mysterious past. The film unfolds with a series of unsettling events, psychological twists, and growing tension as the friends confront their deepest fears and secrets. It's a slower-burn horror with an emphasis on atmosphere, psychological tension, and the occult.

### **Which Is Scarier?**
"The Conjuring 2" is generally considered scarier, especially for those who enjoy more traditional horror elements like ghostly apparitions, demonic possessions, and intense jump scares. It has high production values, a gripping storyline, and a strong emotional core, which adds to its overall impact. "Tarot," while eerie, focuses more on psychological horror and tension rather than outright scares.

### **Recommendation for Tonight:**
If you're in the mood for a well-crafted, intense supernatural horror with a lot of scares and suspense, "The Conjuring 2" would be the better pick. It's a crowd-pleaser with strong performances and chilling moments. However, if you prefer a slower-paced thriller with an emphasis on atmosphere and psychological elements, "Tarot" might be a good choice.

Here are some reviews of *The Witch* (2015), which has received acclaim for its unsettling atmosphere, historical authenticity, and unique approach to horror:

### **Critics' Reviews:**

1. **RogerEbert.com - 4/4 Stars:**
   *"The Witch" is a triumph of tone. It feels like an undiscovered nightmare from the 17th century, offering an experience that's as unsettling and immersive as it is harrowing. With a meticulous dedication to historical accuracy and an eerie, atmospheric score, the film builds dread slowly, culminating in a horrifying climax. The performances, particularly Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin, are exceptional, grounding the supernatural elements in a believable reality."*

2. **The New York Times - Manohla Dargis:**
   *"‘The Witch’ is a chilling, stealthy terror, a meticulously crafted tale of a family unraveling in the wilderness of New England. The film’s period-appropriate language and attention to detail create a palpable sense of place and time, amplifying the horror elements by making them feel achingly real. The movie’s power lies in its ability to create fear from suggestion rather than gore, and it remains unsettling long after it ends."*

3. **Variety - Justin Chang:**
   *"‘The Witch’ is a visually stunning, thematically rich film that embraces a slow-burn approach to horror, opting for psychological dread and eerie atmosphere over conventional jump scares. The film’s commitment to authenticity, from its dialect to its puritanical worldview, gives it an edge, crafting a folk tale that feels both timeless and unnervingly relevant. It’s a haunting story of paranoia, belief, and the fragility of the human mind."*

4. **The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw - 5/5 Stars:**
   *"A chillingly intense debut from director Robert Eggers, ‘The Witch’ is a stunningly crafted horror film that feels authentically steeped in the period it portrays. The film’s creeping sense of dread, heightened by stark cinematography and a haunting score, creates a psychological horror experience that lingers. It’s a terrifying descent into madness and suspicion, amplified by outstanding performances and a story that never compromises its integrity."*

### **Audience Reviews:**

1. **Rotten Tomatoes Audience Review:**
   *“A beautifully shot horror film that doesn’t rely on gore or cheap scares, ‘The Witch’ is genuinely frightening because it feels so real. The setting, the dialogue, the performances – everything feels meticulously thought out, making the horror more immersive and gripping. It’s not for everyone, but for those who like atmospheric, psychological horror, it’s a must-watch.”*

2. **IMDb User Review:**
   *“‘The Witch’ is not a typical horror movie. It’s slow, deliberate, and focuses more on building tension and a sense of unease than outright scares. The ending is polarizing, but if you appreciate a horror film that makes you think and leaves you feeling unsettled, this is the one. The performance by Anya Taylor-Joy is particularly strong, and the cinematography is breathtaking.”*

3. **Metacritic User Review:**
   *“This film is all about mood and atmosphere. It’s haunting and sticks with you. Some might find it too slow or strange, but it’s one of the most original horror movies I’ve seen in a long time. It gets under your skin without being overly violent or relying on jump scares. It’s a thinking person’s horror movie.”*

### **Overall Consensus:**
*The Witch* is highly praised for its atmospheric tension, historical accuracy, and psychological depth. Critics and audiences agree that it’s a different kind of horror film—one that relies on creating a mood of dread and exploring deeper themes rather than delivering straightforward scares. It might not appeal to viewers looking for a traditional horror film with quick frights, but it’s often recommended for those who enjoy slow-burn, thought-provoking horror with a strong artistic vision.
