Yes, there are several alternatives to using Drano to clean out a smelly bathroom sink drain. Here are a few methods you can try:

1. **Baking Soda and Vinegar**:
   - Pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain.
   - Follow it with 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
   - Cover the drain with a plug or cloth to keep the fizzing action focused in the drain.
   - Wait about 15-30 minutes, then flush with hot water. This natural reaction can help break down clogs and remove odors.

2. **Boiling Water**:
   - Boil a kettle of water and carefully pour it down the drain in two or three stages, allowing the hot water to work on any clogs or buildup. This is particularly effective if the clog is due to soap scum or grease.

3. **Plunger**:
   - Use a small plunger specifically designed for sinks. Fill the sink with enough water to cover the plunger cup, then plunge up and down several times to dislodge any blockage.

4. **Manual Cleaning**:
   - Remove the sink stopper and use a drain snake or a bent wire hanger to pull out any visible debris. Sometimes hair, soap, or other materials get caught near the top of the drain.

5. **Enzyme Cleaners**:
   - Use an enzyme-based drain cleaner, which is safer for pipes and the environment compared to chemical drain cleaners. These cleaners use natural enzymes and bacteria to break down organic material.

If these methods do not resolve the problem, there might be a deeper blockage that may require professional assistance.

Can I use CLR?

**Assistant:**

Yes, you can use CLR (Calcium, Lime, and Rust Remover) to clean your bathroom sink drain, but it's important to understand that CLR is specifically designed to remove mineral deposits like calcium, lime, and rust, rather than organic clogs like hair, soap scum, or food particles that usually cause sink odors.

If you suspect that the odor is due to mineral buildup or rust, CLR can help clean and deodorize your drain. However, for organic material, a baking soda and vinegar mixture or an enzyme-based cleaner might be more effective. 

If you decide to use CLR, here’s how to do it safely:
1. Make sure the drain is clear of standing water.
2. Pour a small amount of CLR down the drain (follow the instructions on the bottle for the appropriate amount).
3. Let it sit for a few minutes (as directed on the bottle).
4. Flush the drain with hot water to wash away the residue.

Always follow the safety guidelines on the CLR label, including proper ventilation and wearing gloves, as it can be harsh on skin and eyes.
