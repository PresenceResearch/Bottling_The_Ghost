Repotting a Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia) is a straightforward process that helps ensure healthy growth by giving the plant more space for its roots. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Materials Needed:
- A new pot (2-3 inches larger in diameter than the current pot)
- Fresh potting mix (a well-draining mix, ideally with peat, perlite, and sand)
- Gloves
- Watering can

### Steps:

1. **Choose the Right Time:** The best time to repot a Bird of Paradise is in the spring or early summer when the plant is actively growing.

2. **Prepare the New Pot:** Select a pot that is 2-3 inches larger in diameter than the current one. Ensure it has drainage holes at the bottom to prevent waterlogging. Fill the bottom of the pot with a layer of fresh potting mix.

3. **Remove the Plant from Its Current Pot:** Carefully tip the pot to one side and gently remove the Bird of Paradise. You may need to tap the pot’s sides or gently squeeze it to loosen the root ball.

4. **Examine the Roots:** Check the roots for any signs of damage or rot. Healthy roots should be white or light tan. Trim any damaged, brown, or mushy roots with clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears.

5. **Place in the New Pot:** Position the plant in the center of the new pot. Fill in around the sides with fresh potting mix, pressing down gently to remove any air pockets. Ensure the plant is at the same depth as it was in its previous pot.

6. **Water Thoroughly:** Water the plant well until water drains out of the bottom of the pot. This helps settle the soil around the roots.

7. **Place in Proper Location:** Keep the repotted plant in a bright, indirect light location and avoid direct sunlight for the first week to reduce transplant shock.

8. **Resume Regular Care:** After a week, resume regular care, including watering when the top inch of soil is dry and providing adequate light.

Repotting every 2-3 years or when the roots become crowded will help your Bird of Paradise stay healthy and thrive.
