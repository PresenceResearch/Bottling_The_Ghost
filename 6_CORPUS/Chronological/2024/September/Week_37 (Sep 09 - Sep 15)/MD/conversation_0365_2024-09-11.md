In Maryland, virtual net metering (VNM) is allowed under the state’s community solar program, which enables multiple customers to benefit from a shared solar energy system. Virtual net metering is especially relevant for customers who cannot install solar panels on their property but still want to participate in solar energy programs.

### Key Aspects of Virtual Net Metering in Maryland (BGE Service Area):

1. **Eligibility**: In the Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) service area, eligible participants for virtual net metering include residential, commercial, industrial, non-profit, and government customers. Participants do not need to be located at the same site as the solar generation system but must be within the same utility service area.

2. **Community Solar Pilot Program**: Maryland has a Community Solar Pilot Program that allows multiple customers to share the benefits of a single solar array. This program is designed to promote renewable energy growth and expand access to solar power, especially for those who cannot install solar panels on their property.

3. **Credit Allocation**: Under virtual net metering, participants receive credits on their electricity bills for their share of the electricity generated by the shared solar facility. The utility (BGE in this case) applies these credits to reduce the electricity costs for each participant based on their allocated share of the total energy production.

4. **Billing and Credits**: BGE calculates the credits for VNM based on the retail rate for the energy produced by the shared solar system. These credits are then applied to the participants' monthly electric bills, and any excess credits can be rolled over to future billing periods.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) oversees the implementation and rules of the VNM and Community Solar Pilot Program. Participants and community solar providers must comply with the rules and regulations established by the PSC, including project size limits and reporting requirements.

6. **Project Size and Capacity Limits**: In Maryland, virtual net metering projects are typically capped at a certain size. For community solar, the project size cannot exceed 2 MW, and there are annual limits on the total capacity available for community solar projects within each utility service area.

7. **Program Duration**: The Community Solar Pilot Program in Maryland was initially set to run for a certain period, but it has been extended multiple times. The program continues to evolve based on feedback and performance, so it’s important to check with the Maryland PSC or BGE for the latest updates.

8. **Special Considerations for Low and Moderate-Income Customers**: The program includes specific provisions to ensure that a portion of the capacity is reserved for low and moderate-income customers, aiming to make solar energy more accessible to all.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, you should consult the Maryland Public Service Commission or the BGE website, as policies and regulations may change over time.

how many subscribers can subscribe

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-11 09:56:38*

The number of subscribers that can participate in a virtual net metering (VNM) or community solar project in Maryland, particularly within the Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) service area, is not strictly capped by a specific number of subscribers. Instead, it is governed by several key factors:

### Key Factors Affecting the Number of Subscribers:

1. **Project Size**: The size of the community solar project is a critical factor. In Maryland, a community solar project cannot exceed 2 megawatts (MW) in capacity. The number of subscribers that a project can accommodate will depend on the total capacity of the project and the amount of electricity that each subscriber is allocated.

2. **Minimum and Maximum Allocation**: Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program rules specify that a subscriber must receive at least 1 kilowatt (kW) of the project’s capacity but cannot receive more than 200 kW. This range determines how many subscribers a project can have. For example, a 2 MW project could theoretically support up to 2,000 subscribers if each subscriber is allocated the minimum 1 kW of capacity. However, if subscribers receive larger allocations (e.g., 5 kW or more), the number of subscribers will be fewer.

3. **Subscription Size and Energy Usage**: The actual number of subscribers may also depend on the subscribers' energy usage patterns and the share of the project's output they are subscribed to. Larger users (such as businesses) may take up a larger share of the project's capacity compared to smaller users (such as individual households).

4. **Low and Moderate-Income Requirements**: Maryland’s community solar regulations require that a certain percentage of each project's capacity (currently 30%) be reserved for low and moderate-income customers. This reservation may influence the total number of subscribers a project can have, depending on the size and allocation of the reserved capacity.

5. **Utility Limits and Program Rules**: The Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) sets program limits and rules for each utility service area, including BGE. While there is no direct cap on the number of subscribers, the total capacity of the projects and how that capacity is allocated to different customer types (residential, commercial, low-income, etc.) will ultimately dictate the number of subscribers that can participate in any given project.

6. **Host Organization Rules**: Some community solar projects may have additional rules or limitations set by the host organization (the entity managing the community solar array). These rules might include minimum subscription periods, administrative fees, or other factors that could influence the number of subscribers.

### Conclusion:
While there is no specific numerical cap on the number of subscribers for virtual net metering or community solar projects in Maryland, the project's capacity, the allocation of capacity among subscribers, and regulatory requirements collectively determine the maximum number of participants. Each project's unique circumstances and the specific needs and usage of its subscribers will ultimately define how many people or entities can subscribe.

For precise details about a specific project, it's best to consult directly with the community solar provider or check with the Maryland Public Service Commission for the latest program guidelines.

I own an apartment community with 168 separate meters, one per unit.  If I build a 750 kW system how would I distribute the output to all 168 members of the community

---

**Assistant:**

To distribute the output of a 750 kW solar system across 168 separately metered units in your apartment community using virtual net metering (VNM), you will need to allocate the generated electricity among all the units. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how you could distribute the output:

### 1. **Determine Total Output of the Solar System:**
A 750 kW solar system will produce a certain amount of electricity each month, depending on factors such as location, system efficiency, and sunlight hours. For example, in Maryland, a 750 kW system might produce roughly between 85,000 to 100,000 kWh per month, depending on the season and weather conditions.

### 2. **Calculate Average Allocation Per Unit:**
To distribute the system’s output among 168 units, you’ll need to decide how to allocate the total production. One straightforward approach is to divide the total monthly output by the number of units:

\[
\text{Average Allocation per Unit} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly Output (kWh)}}{\text{Number of Units}}
\]

For example, if your system produces 90,000 kWh in a given month:

\[
\text{Average Allocation per Unit} = \frac{90,000 \text{ kWh}}{168} \approx 535 \text{ kWh per unit}
\]

### 3. **Set Up Allocation Rules:**
You have a few options on how to distribute the generated electricity:

- **Equal Allocation:** You can distribute the solar output equally among all 168 units, meaning each unit receives an equal share of the total energy produced (e.g., 535 kWh per month). This is the simplest approach and ensures each unit benefits equally.

- **Proportional to Usage:** Alternatively, you could allocate the energy based on each unit's historical electricity usage. Units with higher energy consumption would receive a larger share of the solar output. This approach requires an analysis of each unit's past consumption patterns to determine their fair share of the solar energy.

- **Fixed Tiered Allocation:** You could set different allocation tiers based on unit size or type (e.g., one-bedroom vs. two-bedroom apartments). Larger units or units with more occupants could receive a higher allocation compared to smaller units.

### 4. **Billing and Credit Distribution:**
Once the allocation is determined, the output credits can be applied to each unit’s monthly electricity bill:

- **Virtual Net Metering Credits:** Under Maryland’s VNM rules, the utility (BGE in this case) would issue credits on each participating unit’s electricity bill for their share of the solar output. For instance, if a unit is allocated 535 kWh for the month, that unit's bill would be reduced by the retail rate for 535 kWh of electricity.

- **Adjustments for Overproduction or Underproduction:** If the solar system produces more electricity than the total consumption of the units, the excess credits can typically roll over to the following month. Conversely, if the system underproduces relative to the total consumption, each unit may receive a smaller credit.

### 5. **Administrative and Compliance Considerations:**
- **Utility Coordination:** You’ll need to coordinate with BGE and comply with Maryland's VNM rules. Each unit's share of the solar energy must be registered with the utility, and proper agreements must be in place.

- **Community Solar Agreement:** You may need to establish a community solar agreement with the tenants to define how the benefits will be distributed, any associated fees, and the duration of the agreement. 

- **Metering and Monitoring:** Proper metering equipment must be in place to track the solar output and its distribution. The utility will often provide the virtual net metering credits based on the allocations you set up.

### 6. **Addressing Potential Challenges:**
- **Low and Moderate-Income Requirements:** If you are using a shared community solar program, ensure compliance with any specific requirements for low and moderate-income residents.

- **Communication with Residents:** Ensure all residents understand the benefits and implications of the solar system, including how their bills might change and any ongoing responsibilities.

### Summary:
By installing a 750 kW solar system, you can use virtual net metering to distribute the energy output to all 168 units. The allocation can be equal, proportional to usage, or tiered based on unit size. You will need to coordinate with BGE and the residents to ensure proper distribution and billing of the generated electricity credits.

what if all subscribers were low income households

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-11 09:59:22*

If all 168 units in your apartment community are low-income households, there are specific provisions and benefits available under Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program and virtual net metering (VNM) regulations that can help optimize the distribution of the solar energy generated by your 750 kW system.

### Key Considerations for Low-Income Households:

1. **Eligibility for Low-Income Designation**:
   - **Definition**: Low-income households in Maryland typically qualify if their income is at or below 80% of the area median income (AMI) or based on other qualifying criteria established by the state.
   - **Verification**: Each household may need to provide proof of eligibility to qualify for the low-income designation under Maryland's community solar program.

2. **Program Benefits for Low-Income Households**:
   Maryland’s Community Solar Pilot Program has specific provisions to promote access for low-income households:
   
   - **No Upfront Costs**: Generally, low-income subscribers should not be required to pay any upfront costs to participate in the community solar program.
   - **Guaranteed Savings**: The program often mandates that low-income households receive guaranteed savings on their electricity bills compared to what they would have paid without participating in the community solar program. This can translate to receiving a percentage discount on the retail rate for the allocated solar energy.

3. **Allocation of Solar Credits**:
   You can distribute the output of your 750 kW system among the 168 low-income households in a way that maximizes their benefit:

   - **Equal Allocation**: You may choose to distribute the total solar output equally among all 168 units. Each household would receive an equal share of the electricity credits generated by the solar system. For example, if your 750 kW system generates 90,000 kWh in a month, each unit would receive approximately 535 kWh of credits.
   
   - **Custom Allocation for Greater Savings**: Consider allocating more solar energy credits to households with higher energy consumption or greater need to ensure they benefit more from the savings. This can be especially beneficial if some units use more electricity due to size or occupant needs.

4. **Billing and Virtual Net Metering Credits**:
   - **Application of Credits**: The credits will appear on each household's utility bill (from BGE) according to the allocation you have set up. If all the households are low-income, they may receive credits at a favorable rate, further reducing their electricity costs.
   - **Excess Generation**: If the solar system generates more electricity than the community uses, the excess credits can be carried forward to the next month. Any rollover should benefit the low-income subscribers, helping to maximize their savings over time.

5. **Increased Program Flexibility for Low-Income Participants**:
   - **Increased Subscription Capacity**: The program rules may allow for a larger percentage of a project’s capacity to be allocated to low-income participants. This means your entire 750 kW system can be designated to serve low-income households, which can help streamline participation and maximize benefits.

6. **Potential Incentives and Support**:
   - **Incentives for Developers**: There are often additional incentives or support available to developers who dedicate a larger portion (or all) of their project to low-income subscribers. This could include grants, tax credits, or other financial benefits.
   - **Grants and Rebates**: You may be eligible for state or federal grants, rebates, or financing options specifically designed for solar projects that benefit low-income communities. These incentives can help offset the costs of building and maintaining the solar system.

7. **Compliance and Reporting**:
   - **Regulatory Requirements**: Ensure you comply with all Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) rules regarding low-income participation, including proper reporting, verification of income eligibility, and adherence to the program's specific rules and conditions.

8. **Community Engagement and Education**:
   - **Educate Residents**: Communicate clearly with the residents about how the solar program works, what their benefits will be, and how they will see savings on their electricity bills. Provide information in accessible formats and languages as needed.

### Summary:
By designating your 750 kW solar system to serve all low-income households in your apartment community, you can leverage specific benefits under Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program to maximize savings for the residents. You can distribute the output equally or based on household need while ensuring compliance with state regulations and possibly accessing additional incentives for supporting low-income participants.
