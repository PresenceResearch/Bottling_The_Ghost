These deals can help reduce the cost of Max subscriptions, depending on how you prefer to watch (with or without ads) and if you are interested in other included content like Discovery's shows or Warner Bros. movies.

Currently, there aren't many specific bundled packages directly offering Max (formerly HBO Max) with other streaming services. However, there are a few indirect ways you might get a Max subscription bundled or at a discounted rate:

1. **AT&T Wireless and Internet Plans**: Some AT&T customers can get Max included for free with select wireless, internet, and TV plans. This is a common perk that has been offered for some time, so if you're an AT&T customer or considering switching, it's worth checking if your plan includes Max.

2. **Certain Cable or Satellite TV Providers**: Some cable and satellite providers, like DirecTV and Comcast, may offer Max as part of their premium packages. These bundles can often include other premium networks (like STARZ, Showtime, and Cinemax) along with Max.

3. **Bundles with Streaming Devices**: Occasionally, there are promotions where you can get a Max subscription when you purchase a certain streaming device, like a Roku or Apple TV, though this tends to vary by retailer and specific promotions.

4. **Discovery+ and Max Merge Plan**: Since Max includes Discovery's content, the plan effectively bundles Discovery+ and Max content together, but it's not offered as a separate service bundle at this time. However, you get access to both libraries if you subscribe to Max's Ultimate Ad-Free plan.

5. **Add-Ons Through Other Services**: You can often add Max as a premium channel through services like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, or YouTube TV, which might occasionally offer introductory discounts or special deals on the Max subscription.

While there aren't direct bundled packages with Max and other streaming services currently available, keeping an eye on promotions from your wireless provider, cable service, or streaming device retailer could offer a way to get Max at a discounted rate or as part of a bundle.
