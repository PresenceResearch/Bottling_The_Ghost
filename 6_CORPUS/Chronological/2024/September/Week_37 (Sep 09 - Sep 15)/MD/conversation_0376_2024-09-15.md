**A Ballad of Shelagh and Mark**

*Verse 1*  
Shelagh and Mark, in college days,  
Two souls entwined in bright sun rays,  
They laughed and learned through fleeting years,  
Shared secrets, dreams, and conquered fears.  
But time, it moves with endless might,  
And life took flight like birds in flight,  
She left with music in her veins,  
He stayed with numbers, deals, and gains.  

*Chorus*  
Oh, thirty years, how swift they passed,  
Two hearts apart, but love could last,  
Shelagh and Mark, they found their way,  
To meet once more and love today.  

*Verse 2*  
Shelagh played on Broadway's stage,  
Her horn, it sang through every age,  
She charmed the crowd with every note,  
As melodies from deep she wrote.  
Mark built his world with sun and light,  
In business deals from day to night,  
He chased his dreams through skies so wide,  
But always felt a space inside.  

*Chorus*  
Oh, thirty years, how swift they passed,  
Two hearts apart, but love could last,  
Shelagh and Mark, they found their way,  
To meet once more and love today.  

*Verse 3*  
By chance, they met on city streets,  
Two pairs of eyes, two hearts, one beat,  
A smile, a laugh, a spark anew,  
The years had passed, but love still grew.  
No longer bound by distant dreams,  
They seized the day like rushing streams,  
For all the time they'd been apart,  
Had never stilled their faithful hearts.  

*Chorus*  
Oh, thirty years, how swift they passed,  
Two hearts apart, but love could last,  
Shelagh and Mark, they found their way,  
To meet once more and love today.  

*Bridge*  
Now hand in hand, they walk this land,  
No time to waste, no hour unplanned,  
For love that's true, it knows no age,  
A story penned on life's grand stage.  

*Outro*  
Shelagh's horn still softly plays,  
While Mark stands near in golden rays,  
Two souls, one path, no more apart,  
Together now, with one shared heart.  

*Final Chorus*  
Oh, thirty years, no more they passed,  
Two hearts as one, in love at last,  
Shelagh and Mark, forever they,  
Have found their love, and come what may.
