Can you write a fun upbeat song about my wife Sheila Abate?  Please include “she’s little and she’s nice” and “she’s loud, she’s chubby, and she likes to wear red”. Say something about her big dangly earrings and that she is from Long Island. Say that she is the “friendly neighborhood horn professor”

**Title: "Sheila from Long Island"**

*(Verse 1)*  
She’s little and she’s nice, a real dynamo  
Got a smile that lights up everywhere she goes  
From Long Island to the big city scene  
She’s the friendly neighborhood horn professor queen  

*(Chorus)*  
Oh, Sheila, Sheila, dancing in her red  
She’s loud, she’s chubby, got a lot in her head  
With big dangly earrings that swing with every beat  
She’s bringing all the love right to your street  

*(Verse 2)*  
She’s a teacher with a passion, oh, she’s got the flair  
Showing every student how to blow with care  
Her laugh rings out, it’s music to the ears  
Sheila’s got that spirit that everybody cheers  

*(Bridge)*  
She’s the life of the party, the heart of the town  
Rocking those red dresses, never feeling down  
Always with a tune, a rhythm, and a song  
She’s a burst of sunshine, carrying us along  

*(Chorus)*  
Oh, Sheila, Sheila, in her red delight  
She’s little, she’s nice, she shines so bright  
With those big dangly earrings and that Long Island charm  
She’s the horn professor with a heart so warm  

*(Outro)*  
Yeah, Sheila’s got the groove, Sheila’s got the style  
From Long Island streets to every brass aisle  
She’s the one you know, the one you love,  
Sheila Abate, sent from above!  

*(Spoken)*  
"That’s Sheila, folks, rockin’ that red, all day, every day!"
