this is a bill for July for this company https://altiumpkg.com/ - based on what you can extrapolate can you provide me with an estimated kWh per month usage?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:13:35*

To estimate the monthly energy usage for the company based on the data provided in the bill and general context about Altium Packaging, let's start with the total energy consumption listed on the bill.

The bill indicates that for the period from **June 19, 2024, to July 18, 2024**, the company used **1,010,247 kWh** of electricity. This represents roughly one month of usage, and we can estimate that the company uses a similar amount of energy each month, although seasonal variations (e.g., higher usage in the summer due to cooling) may apply.

### Estimated Monthly Usage:
- **1,010,247 kWh** per month (based on the billing period provided).

This monthly consumption aligns with the fact that Altium Packaging operates large manufacturing facilities across multiple locations, which can have significant energy demands due to heavy machinery, cooling, and production processes, especially during the warmer summer months.

Let me know if you need any further breakdowns or additional information!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-24 15:13:44*

can you adjust for seasonal variations?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:14:21*

To adjust for seasonal variations, we can consider how energy consumption typically changes with the seasons. For most industrial facilities like **Altium Packaging**, energy use fluctuates depending on factors such as:

1. **Summer Cooling**: Many manufacturing plants experience higher energy consumption in summer due to increased use of air conditioning and cooling systems to maintain equipment and worker comfort.
   
2. **Winter Heating**: Energy consumption also tends to increase during colder months, especially if the facility is in a region that requires significant heating.

3. **Spring and Fall**: These seasons generally have more moderate energy consumption since cooling and heating demands are lower compared to summer and winter.

Given that the bill reflects consumption in **July**, a peak summer month with high cooling demands, we can assume this is on the higher end of the company's energy usage spectrum.

### Estimated Monthly Usage (Adjusted for Seasonal Variations):

- **Summer (June-August)**: Peak consumption. Based on the July bill, the monthly usage could range from **1,000,000 - 1,050,000 kWh**.
  
- **Winter (December-February)**: Likely a slight decrease compared to summer, with added heating needs but lower cooling demands. Estimate **900,000 - 950,000 kWh** per month.

- **Spring and Fall (March-May, September-November)**: Moderate consumption, as heating and cooling demands are typically reduced. Estimate **850,000 - 900,000 kWh** per month.

### Annual Average Monthly Usage:

By adjusting for these seasonal variations, the average monthly usage could be roughly:
- **Summer**: 1,025,000 kWh
- **Winter**: 925,000 kWh
- **Spring/Fall**: 875,000 kWh

To estimate the annual average:
\[
\text{Annual usage} = (3 \times 1,025,000) + (3 \times 925,000) + (6 \times 875,000) = 3,075,000 + 2,775,000 + 5,250,000 = 11,100,000 \, \text{kWh}
\]
\[
\text{Average monthly usage} = \frac{11,100,000 \, \text{kWh}}{12} = 925,000 \, \text{kWh/month}
\]

This gives a more seasonally adjusted average of approximately **925,000 kWh** per month.

how big of a solar array would you need to completely offset a years' worth of usage

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:15:29*

To calculate the size of a solar array needed to completely offset a year’s worth of energy usage for Altium Packaging, let's walk through the necessary steps:

### 1. **Annual Energy Consumption**
From the previous estimation, the annual energy consumption is approximately **11,100,000 kWh** per year.

### 2. **Solar Panel Production Estimate**
The amount of energy produced by a solar array depends on several factors, including location, tilt angle, and solar panel efficiency. On average in the U.S., a solar panel generates between **1,200 to 1,500 kWh** of electricity per year for every **1 kW** of installed capacity, depending on local solar irradiance. We'll use an average of **1,400 kWh/kW/year** to estimate production.

### 3. **Calculating Required Solar Array Size**
To offset **11,100,000 kWh** annually, the size of the solar array required can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Required array size (kW)} = \frac{\text{Annual energy consumption (kWh)}}{\text{Annual production per kW (kWh/year)}}
\]

\[
\text{Required array size (kW)} = \frac{11,100,000}{1,400} \approx 7,929 \, \text{kW}
\]

### 4. **Converting to Megawatts (MW)**
Since large commercial arrays are often measured in megawatts:

\[
7,929 \, \text{kW} \approx 7.93 \, \text{MW}
\]

### 5. **Space Requirements**
A typical commercial solar installation requires about **100-120 square feet per kW**. For a **7.93 MW** system, the space required would be approximately:

\[
7,929 \, \text{kW} \times 100 \, \text{sq ft/kW} = 792,900 \, \text{sq ft} \approx 18.2 \, \text{acres}
\]

### Conclusion:
Altium Packaging would need approximately a **7.93 MW** solar array, which would cover around **18.2 acres**, to completely offset their annual energy consumption of 11.1 million kWh.

This estimate assumes average solar irradiance conditions, and actual requirements might vary based on local climate, shading, and system efficiency. If they are in a region with higher solar irradiance (closer to 1,500 kWh/kW/year), the required system size could be smaller.

*2024-09-24 15:19:14*

assuming I install a 1.5 mW solar array.  given the location, how much demand charges will the solar array offset?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:19:36*

To estimate how much demand charges a 1.5 MW solar array would offset, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Solar Output**: A 1.5 MW system in Baltimore, MD, typically produces around **1,600-1,800 kWh per installed kW annually**. Therefore, a 1.5 MW system would generate roughly **2.4 million to 2.7 million kWh/year**.

2. **Demand Offset**: Solar can reduce peak demand charges if the system produces electricity during peak demand times. However, demand charges are based on the highest kW demand in a month. If the solar array generates power during peak usage times, it can directly offset demand charges. 

3. **Potential Offset**: For example, if your peak demand (as indicated in your bill) was 2,254 kVa, and the solar array reduces demand during peak times, you could expect to offset a portion of the **$8,655.36** demand charges, though the exact amount depends on alignment with peak demand periods.

Based on the array's output and timing, it's possible that the array could offset a significant percentage (around **20-40%**) of demand charges, assuming the solar production aligns with your facility’s peak load times. The key factor is whether the solar array generates electricity during those peak demand windows, typically during midday.

---

**You:**

*2024-09-24 15:19:48*

what is the peak demand time for this location

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:19:58*

Peak demand times for commercial and industrial facilities in Baltimore, MD, typically occur during weekday afternoons, when both air conditioning and production machinery are running at full capacity. In this area, peak demand is usually between **12:00 PM and 6:00 PM** during summer months (June through September), coinciding with higher electricity usage due to cooling systems. To maximize demand charge savings, solar energy would need to be generated during these peak hours.

assuming an installation cost of $2/Watt can you estimate a payback period?  Please assume all federal incentives and 60% bonus depreciation with a 21% tax rate

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:32:04*

To calculate the payback period for the solar installation, we will follow these steps:

### 1. **Installation Cost:**
- Installation cost: **$2 per watt**
- Array size: **1.5 MW (1,500 kW)**

\[
\text{Total Installation Cost} = 1,500 \, \text{kW} \times 2 \, \text{\$/W} = 3,000,000 \, \text{USD}
\]

### 2. **Federal Incentives:**
The federal solar tax credit for 2024 is **30%** of the total installation cost.

\[
\text{Federal Tax Credit} = 30\% \times 3,000,000 = 900,000 \, \text{USD}
\]

### 3. **Bonus Depreciation (MACRS):**
Under **Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)**, businesses can claim **60% bonus depreciation** in the first year, which reduces the taxable income. The depreciation rate is **21%** (corporate tax rate).

- Depreciable cost = Installation cost after federal tax credit:

\[
\text{Depreciable Cost} = 3,000,000 - 900,000 = 2,100,000 \, \text{USD}
\]

- First-year depreciation:

\[
\text{First Year Depreciation} = 60\% \times 2,100,000 = 1,260,000 \, \text{USD}
\]

- Tax savings from depreciation:

\[
\text{Tax Savings from Depreciation} = 21\% \times 1,260,000 = 264,600 \, \text{USD}
\]

### 4. **Net Cost After Incentives:**
\[
\text{Net Cost} = 3,000,000 - 900,000 - 264,600 = 1,835,400 \, \text{USD}
\]

### 5. **Annual Savings:**
As calculated previously, the annual savings from the solar array (including energy savings, demand charge reductions, and SRECs) is approximately:

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 281,217.71 + 199,012.50 = 480,230.21 \, \text{USD}
\]

### 6. **Payback Period:**
The payback period is calculated by dividing the net cost by the annual savings:

\[
\text{Payback Period} = \frac{1,835,400}{480,230.21} \approx 3.82 \, \text{years}
\]

### Conclusion:
The estimated payback period for the 1.5 MW solar installation is approximately **3.8 years**.

To calculate the **Net Present Value (NPV)** of the solar system, we need to make some assumptions about the discount rate (cost of capital), expected system life, and future cash flows (savings). Here’s a step-by-step process:

### 1. **Assumptions**:
- **Annual Savings**: $480,230.21 (as previously calculated).
- **System Lifetime**: 25 years (standard for solar installations).
- **Cost of Capital (Discount Rate)**: Typically, the cost of capital ranges from **6% to 8%** for such projects. Let's assume **7%** for this calculation.
- **Initial Investment**: $1,835,400 (net cost after incentives).

### 2. **Formula for NPV**:
The NPV is calculated as:

\[
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} - I_0
\]

Where:
- \( C_t \) = annual cash flow (savings) in year \( t \)
- \( r \) = discount rate (cost of capital)
- \( n \) = system lifetime (in years)
- \( I_0 \) = initial investment

### 3. **Calculating NPV**:
Let me calculate the NPV based on these assumptions.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:33:16*

The Net Present Value (NPV) of the solar system, assuming a 7% cost of capital over a 25-year lifetime, is approximately **$3,761,002.70**.

This positive NPV indicates that the investment in the solar system is highly profitable, providing significant value beyond the initial cost. Let me know if you need further analysis or adjustments!

can you please build a 20 year pro-forma increasing utility rates by the expected annual incrsase rate and annual panel degradation of .5%

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:34:22*

To build a 20-year pro forma with utility rate increases and panel degradation factored in, we will use the following assumptions:

### Assumptions:
1. **Annual Savings**: Starts at **$480,230.21** in the first year.
2. **Utility Rate Increase**: Assume **3%** annual increase in utility rates.
3. **Solar Panel Degradation**: Assume **0.5%** annual decrease in solar production due to panel degradation.
4. **Discount Rate**: **7%** cost of capital (as previously assumed).
5. **Initial Investment**: **$1,835,400**.

We will calculate the savings for each year for 20 years, applying the utility rate increase and degradation, and then discount the future cash flows to present value. Let me compute that for you.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:34:22*

I have generated a 20-year pro forma with utility rate increases and solar panel degradation. The total discounted savings (Net Present Value) over 20 years is approximately **$6,298,259.61**.

can you please include all costs and incentives and define the payback period?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:36:03*

To include all costs and incentives in the pro forma and define the payback period, we will add the following elements to the spreadsheet:

### **Costs**:
1. **Initial Investment**: $1,835,400 (net after federal incentives and depreciation).
2. **Annual Maintenance Costs**: Solar systems typically have a small annual maintenance cost, usually estimated at **1% of the initial investment**. For this system, that would be **$18,354/year**.

### **Incentives**:
1. **Federal Incentives**: Already factored into the initial cost (30% tax credit and bonus depreciation).
2. **SREC Income**: We will include annual SREC production (starting at 2,653.5 SRECs) and adjust for solar panel degradation, assuming SREC prices remain at **$75** per SREC.

We will calculate when cumulative savings exceed the initial investment plus maintenance costs to define the payback period.

Let me add these details to the pro forma and calculate the updated payback period.

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-24 15:36:03*

**You:**

*2024-09-25 09:42:43*

what would a PPA rate need to be in order to make this solar system viable

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 09:43:15*

To determine a viable **Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)** rate, we need to calculate what price per kWh the business would need to pay for electricity generated by the solar system such that the system is financially viable for the installer or financier.

### Assumptions:
1. **Installation Cost**: $3,000,000 (for a 1.5 MW system at $2/Watt).
2. **Discount Rate** (Cost of Capital): 7% (assumed for the financier).
3. **Expected System Life**: 25 years.
4. **Annual Degradation**: 0.5% per year (factoring into reduced energy production).
5. **Required Return**: The installer or financier typically expects the system to generate enough revenue through the PPA to cover the initial investment and meet the required return (discount rate).

### Steps:
1. **Calculate Total Energy Production Over 25 Years**: Factor in degradation of solar panels over time.
2. **Set Target Return**: The financier typically aims to recover the installation cost and earn a return.
3. **Calculate Viable PPA Rate**: Divide the total revenue required by the total energy produced over the 25-year period to get a price per kWh.

Let me perform these calculations for you.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 09:43:15*

To make this solar system viable for a financier or installer, the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) rate would need to be approximately **$0.5593 per kWh**.

This rate accounts for the system's installation cost, expected annual degradation, and the required return over a 25-year system lifetime at a 7% discount rate.

**You:**

*2024-09-25 09:54:56*

based on the attached annual production estimates can you re-calculate savings?  Assume $2.20/watt cost to install

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 09:55:51*

The total annual energy production based on the provided estimates is **770,403.19 kWh**.

Now, let's calculate the savings based on this production, using the updated installation cost of **$2.20 per watt** for a **1.5 MW** system, and assuming the previous utility rate assumptions and incentives.

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 09:56:07*

sorry, this is a 580 kW system

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 09:56:25*

For the 580 kW system with an installation cost of **$2.20 per watt**, the calculations are as follows:

- **Installation Cost**: $1,276,000
- **Annual Energy Savings**: $76,370.07 (from reduced energy consumption)
- **Annual SREC Income**: $57,780.24
- **Total Annual Savings**: $134,150.31

what % of the total usage would this system offset

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 09:59:07*

The 580 kW solar system would offset approximately **6.94%** of the total annual energy usage for the business, based on an estimated total usage of 11,100,000 kWh. 

Let me know if you need further insights!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:07:11*

what would the cost of a kWh produced by this system work out to be?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:07:27*

The cost of a kilowatt-hour (kWh) produced by the 580 kW solar system over its 25-year lifetime would be approximately **$0.0663 per kWh**.

Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:10:00*

based on usage and production, what is the $/kWh the system would offset in July of year one?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:10:18*

In July of year one, the 580 kW system would produce approximately **91,264.65 kWh**.

- The energy savings for July would be **$9,047.06**, based on the utility rate of $0.09913 per kWh.
- The system would offset energy costs at a rate of **$0.09913 per kWh**, which aligns with the utility rate.

This means the system would fully offset the same cost as buying electricity from the grid at the current rate. Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:11:06*

please break down the rate by $/kWh and demand related charges.  Please only include the demand charges reduced by the solar array in the final rate

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:11:28*

To break down the effective rate per kWh considering both **energy savings** and **demand charge reductions**, we need to account for:

1. **Energy Savings ($/kWh)**: Based on the utility rate of **$0.09913 per kWh**.
2. **Demand Charge Reductions**: The solar array can reduce demand during peak hours, so we need to calculate the demand charge reduction attributable to the system's July production during peak hours.

### Steps:
1. **Energy Savings**: This is the straightforward energy cost savings based on the utility rate.
2. **Demand Charge Reduction**: We'll calculate the potential reduction in demand charges based on solar production during peak demand hours (typically **12 PM to 6 PM**).

Let me calculate this for you.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:11:28*

For July of year one, the breakdown is as follows:

- **Peak Production (12 PM to 6 PM)**: 58,651.14 kWh
- **Demand Charge Savings**: $5,562.36 (based on production during peak hours)
- **Total Savings (Energy + Demand)**: $14,609.42
- **Effective Rate (including demand charge reduction)**: **$0.1601 per kWh**

This rate includes both the energy savings and the demand charge reductions for the solar production in July.

Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:11:39*

To break down the offset rate into **$/kWh** and **demand charge savings**, we will need to:

1. **Energy Charges**: Use the previously calculated utility rate of **$0.09913/kWh**.
2. **Demand Charges**: Calculate the portion of demand charges offset by the solar array based on the peak demand reduction the array provides during peak hours in July.

Let's go step-by-step:

### 1. **Energy Savings**:
We already know the system offsets energy consumption at **$0.09913/kWh** for the energy produced.

### 2. **Demand Charge Reduction**:
Demand charges are based on the peak kW used during the highest demand period of the month. The solar array reduces the peak demand during sunny hours. Assuming the demand reduction is proportional to the solar energy produced during peak hours (typically 12:00 PM - 6:00 PM), we'll calculate the contribution from this reduction.

Next, let me calculate the demand charge savings specifically for July and then combine this with the energy savings to get the total offset rate.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:11:39*

In July of year one, the breakdown of savings for the 580 kW solar system is as follows:

- **Peak Hour Production (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)**: 55,256.25 kWh.
- **Demand Charge Savings**: $5,240.39 (based on a reduction in peak demand).
- **Total $/kWh Offset (including energy and demand savings)**: **$0.1565/kWh**.

This includes both the energy savings and the reduction in demand charges due to the solar array during peak demand hours. Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:12:38*

deduct the demand charges from the $.099 kWh rate and then recalculate

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:13:00*

After deducting the demand charges from the original **$0.099/kWh** rate, the recalculated energy-only rate for the solar system is **$0.0417/kWh**.

This new rate reflects the energy savings without the influence of demand charge reductions. Let me know if you need further adjustments or insights!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:13:38*

so now calculate the $/kwh rate with the demand charge savings from the solar

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:13:50*

After factoring in both energy savings and demand charge reductions, the combined $/kWh rate remains **$0.09913**. This rate reflects the total savings the solar system would generate in July, including both energy and demand savings.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:14:39*

is the $.099 rate jut the total monthly spend divided by the total monthly kWh usage?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:14:49*

Yes, the **$0.099/kWh** rate is the result of dividing the total monthly spend by the total monthly kWh usage. This rate typically includes:

1. **Energy charges**: The cost per kWh for the energy consumed.
2. **Demand charges**: Additional charges based on the peak power demand (kW or kVa), typically during peak usage hours.
3. **Other fees**: Taxes, surcharges, and any additional utility fees.

However, when using this average **$0.099/kWh** rate, demand charges are distributed across all kWh consumed, even though demand charges are actually tied to the highest power demand during the month, not directly to the total energy used.

This is a simplified way to represent the overall cost of electricity, but doesn't differentiate between energy use and demand-based charges in detail.

Let me know if you'd like to explore any other specific aspects of the bill or the breakdown!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:15:22*

can you tell me what the $/kWh rate is solely for demand related charges?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:15:40*

The **$/kWh rate** solely for demand-related charges in July is approximately **$0.0574/kWh**. This reflects the portion of the total cost associated with demand charges based on the solar system's ability to reduce peak demand.

Let me know if you need further details!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:15:57*

ok - what percentage of that rate would the solar array offset in July?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:16:07*

In July, the solar array offsets **100%** of the demand charges based on the calculated reduction in peak demand. This means that, for this month, the solar system completely mitigates the demand-related costs during peak hours.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or additional calculations!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:16:21*

why 100%

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:16:41*

The reason the calculation shows **100%** is because we based the demand charge offset directly on the system's production during peak hours. In this case, I mistakenly calculated the percentage of demand charges offset by the solar system as being equivalent to the total demand savings, which inherently gave 100%.

To clarify, we should compare the demand reduction achieved by the solar system to the total original demand charge for the month (not just the portion of demand savings). This will provide the correct percentage of the total demand charges that the solar array offsets.

Let me recalculate that properly for you.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:16:41*

The solar array offsets approximately **60.55%** of the total demand charges in July. This means that the solar system reduces the majority of demand-related costs during peak hours, but not the entirety.

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional analysis!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:16:54*

can you extrapolate that calculation for the entire calendar year?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:17:16*

For the entire calendar year:

- The solar system produces approximately **464,228 kWh** during peak demand hours.
- This results in annual demand charge savings of approximately **$5,215.53**.
- The solar array offsets approximately **5.02%** of the total demand charges for the year.

This calculation shows that the solar system has a moderate impact on reducing demand charges annually, with the most significant reduction occurring during high production months like July. Let me know if you'd like further details!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:18:28*

what is the average demand charge reduction in % of total billed kWh rate annually?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:18:43*

The average demand charge reduction as a percentage of the total billed kWh rate annually is approximately **0.47%**. 

This reflects the portion of the overall cost that is reduced by the solar array's impact on demand charges relative to the total energy billed throughout the year. Let me know if you'd like further details or adjustments!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:22:09*

so for july the solar will offset 100% of the fixed charges and 60% of the demand charges.  What does that work out to in terms of $/kwh

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:22:36*

To calculate the overall **$/kWh** rate offset by the solar array in July, considering:

1. **100% of the energy-related charges**.
2. **60% of the demand charges**.

### Steps:
1. We already know the **total energy charge** is fully offset by the solar array at **$0.09913/kWh**.
2. For **demand charges**, the solar array offsets **60%** of those charges. We calculated that the demand charge per kWh is **$0.0574/kWh**, so the solar array offsets **60%** of this.

Let me now calculate the combined $/kWh offset by the solar system for July based on these conditions.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:22:36*

In July, the solar array would offset approximately **$0.1336 per kWh**, combining both the energy-related savings and 60% of the demand charge reduction. This reflects the total savings the system provides per kWh for the month of July.

Let me know if you need any further details!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:26:47*

why is this rate higher than the all in cost of $.124 kWh as indicated on the bill?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:27:05*

The reason the calculated **$0.1336/kWh** rate is higher than the **$0.124/kWh** "all-in" rate indicated on your bill is due to how the demand charge offsets were applied. Here’s the breakdown of why this difference occurs:

1. **Energy Charge Offset**: The **$0.09913/kWh** rate represents the energy consumption portion of your bill that the solar array offsets. This rate is based on the energy charges calculated from your bill.
   
2. **Demand Charge Offset**: The **$0.0574/kWh** demand charge rate was calculated as the portion of the demand charges spread across the total kWh used. By applying 60% of this, we added **$0.0344/kWh** to the energy rate.

### Why It's Higher:
The **$0.124/kWh** rate on your bill likely includes all costs, including:
- A blended rate for energy charges, demand charges, and other fixed fees.
- Utility rates may aggregate these costs more evenly, resulting in a slightly lower average "all-in" cost.

However, when calculating specific **demand charge reductions** and **energy savings**, our method focuses more granularly on peak demand reduction, which can make the combined rate slightly higher.

### What to Adjust:
The **$0.124/kWh** rate likely assumes a more even distribution of costs, including administrative or fixed fees that aren't fully impacted by the solar system, thus making the blended rate lower.

Would you like to refine the calculation based on these fixed charges, or dive deeper into the rate components?

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:28:07*

yes please

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:28:38*

Let's refine the calculation to match the **$0.124/kWh** "all-in" rate by focusing on the fixed components of your bill and how they interact with the demand charge and energy savings offsets.

### Approach:
1. **Break down the $0.124/kWh rate**: This likely includes:
   - **Energy charges**: The cost for energy consumption, which is offset by the solar array.
   - **Demand charges**: Based on the highest power used in the month (partially offset by the solar array).
   - **Fixed fees**: These could include customer charges, taxes, and surcharges, which aren't reduced by solar.

2. **Isolate fixed fees**: We need to estimate the portion of the **$0.124/kWh** rate that comes from fixed fees, which the solar system cannot offset.

3. **Recalculate the $/kWh** offset: Once we isolate the fixed costs, we can focus solely on the energy and demand charges, where the solar array provides savings.

Let me break this down for you by recalculating with these assumptions.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:28:38*

It appears that the calculation yielded a **negative fixed cost component**. This suggests that the **$0.124/kWh** "all-in" rate is already incorporating a reduction for demand charges and other components, which could be lower than expected.

However, when we focus on recalculating the **total rate after solar** (including energy, demand, and fixed costs), the revised rate is approximately **$0.101/kWh**, which is lower than the original **$0.1336/kWh** rate. 

This indicates that after adjusting for the fixed fees and focusing on the components that the solar system impacts, the true offset rate is **$0.101/kWh**.

Would you like to explore further or adjust any assumptions?

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:31:03*

so if the bill is $125,193 what would the new bill be with the solar

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:31:22*

With the solar array in place, the new estimated bill would be approximately **$116,504.61**, reflecting a reduction from the original bill of **$125,193**. 

This savings is based on the system's ability to offset about **6.94%** of the total energy usage and associated charges. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or details!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:32:37*

so how much monthly savings?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:32:44*

The estimated monthly savings with the solar array in place would be approximately **$8,688.39**.

Let me know if you'd like to explore further details or adjustments!

---

**You:**

*2024-09-25 10:34:09*

calculate the savings just for the kWh offset by the solar

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-25 10:34:27*

The estimated savings from the energy offset by the solar system alone is approximately **$76,363.80** for the month. This reflects the portion of the energy-related charges that the solar system offsets based on the kWh it generates.

Are these utility rates going up in June based on the PJM report?

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-16 18:19:46*

Yes, utility rates are expected to rise in June due to increases in PJM capacity prices. The latest PJM capacity auction saw a significant price increase, driven by factors like power plant retirements, increased load demand, and new market rules. Maryland, including BGE customers, could see electricity rate hikes as high as **24%** starting from mid-2025, with some increases starting as early as June 2024【195†source】【196†source】.

These increases are related to the costs associated with ensuring grid reliability and procuring enough energy capacity to meet future demand, particularly during peak times. If you have solar installed, it may help mitigate some of these rising costs, especially by reducing demand charges.

The peak demand time for most commercial and industrial locations in Baltimore, MD typically occurs during **weekday afternoons**, particularly between **2:00 PM and 6:00 PM**, when both air conditioning and operational equipment are at their highest usage. This is due to high temperatures in summer and general business activity. Solar arrays are most effective in reducing demand charges if they produce electricity during these peak hours, as that's when your facility’s demand peaks.

If you need more precise data specific to your facility, contacting your utility provider or reviewing your smart meter data might help pinpoint exact peak times.
