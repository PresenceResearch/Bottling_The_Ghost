**Assistant:**

*2025-01-05 10:08:41*

Here's a detailed breakdown of your monthly electricity usage and daily averages based on the graph and data in the bill:

### **Monthly Usage**
- **Total Usage**: 940 kWh over 29 days.
- **Average Daily Usage**: \( 940 \, \text{kWh} \div 29 \, \text{days} = 32.4 \, \text{kWh/day} \).

### **Analysis of the Graph**
The graph on **Page 3** shows daily electricity usage for this billing period:

1. **Highest Daily Usage**:
   - Dates: November 7, 8, 9
   - Daily kWh: Approximately 80–90 kWh.

2. **Lowest Daily Usage**:
   - Dates: November 27 and December 1
   - Daily kWh: Approximately 10–20 kWh.

3. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Usage spikes around mid-November, suggesting increased energy consumption (possibly due to heating or additional appliance use).
   - Lower usage near the end of the period, around Thanksgiving weekend, possibly due to reduced activity or being away from home.

### **Temperature Correlation**
The bill indicates average daily temperatures for December 2024 were slightly warmer than December 2023 (53°F vs. 49°F). This might explain relatively moderate heating energy usage compared to colder years.

If you'd like, I can help you track trends, identify ways to optimize energy use, or compare usage across different months. Let me know!

**You:**

*2025-01-05 10:12:52*

lovely.  Thannk you.  Can you do the same thing but in dollars instead of kWh?  Make any assumptions you think are correct

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-01-05 10:13:32*

Here’s an analysis of monthly charges in **dollars** based on the kWh data from the graph. I’ll make the following **assumptions**:

1. **2024 Rates**:
   - Delivery Rate: $0.043314 per kWh (from your bill).
   - Supply Rate: $0.105060 per kWh (from your bill).
   - Combined Rate: \( 0.043314 + 0.105060 = 0.148374 \, \text{per kWh} \).

2. **2023 Rates**:
   - Assume a **5% lower rate** due to possible rate increases in 2024.
   - Combined Rate: \( 0.148374 \times 0.95 = 0.141956 \, \text{per kWh} \).

3. **Calculations**:
   - Monthly Cost = \( \text{kWh usage} \times \text{Combined Rate} \).

**You:**

*2025-01-05 10:22:22*

please simulate the effect of a 12.6 kW solararray with a TSRF of 1129.  The project is located in Potomac, MD

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-01-05 10:23:06*

To simulate the effect of a **12.6 kW solar array** with a **TSRF of 1129** located in **Potomac, MD**, I will estimate the energy production and potential savings. Here's how the simulation is done:

---

### **Assumptions for the Simulation**
1. **System Size**: 12.6 kW (DC).
2. **Total Solar Resource Fraction (TSRF)**: 1129 means the array is 112.9% efficient compared to a standard TSRF of 1000.
3. **Location (Potomac, MD)**:
   - Average solar irradiance: ~4.5 peak sun hours/day.
   - Annual effective sunlight: ~1,642 kWh/kW (DC) for standard TSRF = 1000.
4. **Electricity Rate**: $0.148 per kWh (from your bill).
5. **Annual Degradation**: Solar panels degrade at ~0.5% per year.
6. **System Efficiency**: Assume 85% overall efficiency after losses (inverter, wiring, etc.).

---

### **Estimated Solar Energy Production**
1. **Base Production** (at TSRF 1000):
   - \( 12.6 \, \text{kW} \times 1,642 \, \text{kWh/kW/year} = 20,689.2 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

2. **TSRF Adjustment**:
   - \( 20,689.2 \, \text{kWh/year} \times \frac{1129}{1000} = 23,339.4 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

3. **Efficiency Loss**:
   - \( 23,339.4 \, \text{kWh/year} \times 0.85 = 19,838.5 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

---

### **Impact on Monthly Usage**
From your bill, your **average monthly usage** is:
- \( 940 \, \text{kWh/month} \times 12 = 11,280 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

**Excess Production**:
- Annual solar production = **19,838.5 kWh**.
- Household consumption = **11,280 kWh**.
- Excess = \( 19,838.5 - 11,280 = 8,558.5 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

You would generate **more electricity than you consume**, making your system a net exporter to the grid.

---

### **Financial Savings**
1. **Electricity Offset**:
   - 11,280 kWh offset at $0.148/kWh = **$1,669.44/year**.
2. **Net Metering Credit** (Excess Energy):
   - 8,558.5 kWh exported at $0.10/kWh (assumed rate for net metering) = **$855.85/year**.

**Total Savings**:
- $1,669.44 + $855.85 = **$2,525.29/year**.

---

### **Additional Considerations**
1. **Federal Tax Credit**: 30% of system cost (as of 2024).
2. **SREC Income** (Maryland):
   - Maryland SREC price = ~$40–50.
   - Annual SRECs = \( 19.8 \, \text{MWh/year} = 19.8 \, \text{SRECs/year} \).
   - Income = \( 19.8 \times 40 = 792 \, \text{USD/year} \).

**Total Savings + Income**:
- $2,525.29 + $792 = **$3,317.29/year**.

---

### **Payback Period**
If the system costs **$30,000**:
- Payback period = \( 30,000 \, \text{USD} \div 3,317.29 \, \text{USD/year} = \text{~9 years} \).

---

### **Summary**
A 12.6 kW solar array in Potomac, MD, with a TSRF of 1129 would:
- Generate **19,838.5 kWh/year**.
- Cover your entire electricity needs and export **8,558.5 kWh/year**.
- Save approximately **$3,317/year**, including net metering credits and SRECs.
- Pay for itself in **~9 years**, with additional tax credit benefits.

**You:**

*2025-01-05 10:23:54*

please assume site efficiency of 1129 kWh per kWp

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-01-05 10:24:35*

If we assume **site efficiency of 1129 kWh per kWp**, the energy production and financial impact of your **12.6 kW solar array** in **Potomac, MD** would be as follows:

---

### **Assumptions**
1. **System Size**: 12.6 kW (DC).
2. **Site Efficiency**: 1129 kWh per kWp.
3. **Electricity Rate**: $0.148 per kWh.
4. **Annual Consumption**: Based on your bill, **11,280 kWh/year**.
5. **Net Metering Rate for Excess**: $0.10 per kWh.
6. **Maryland SREC Price**: $40/SREC.

---

### **Solar Energy Production**
1. **Annual Production**:
   - \( 12.6 \, \text{kW} \times 1129 \, \text{kWh/kWp} = 14,215.4 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

2. **Excess Production**:
   - Annual Solar Production = **14,215.4 kWh**.
   - Household Consumption = **11,280 kWh**.
   - Excess = \( 14,215.4 - 11,280 = 2,935.4 \, \text{kWh/year} \).

---

### **Financial Savings**
1. **Electricity Offset**:
   - \( 11,280 \, \text{kWh/year} \times 0.148 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 1,671.36 \, \text{\$/year} \).

2. **Net Metering Credit (Excess Production)**:
   - \( 2,935.4 \, \text{kWh/year} \times 0.10 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 293.54 \, \text{\$/year} \).

3. **SREC Income**:
   - SRECs generated = \( 14.215 \, \text{MWh/year} = 14.215 \, \text{SRECs/year} \).
   - \( 14.215 \times 40 \, \text{\$/SREC} = 568.60 \, \text{\$/year} \).

**Total Annual Savings + Income**:
- $1,671.36 (offset) + $293.54 (net metering) + $568.60 (SRECs) = **$2,533.50/year**.

---

### **Payback Period**
If the system costs **$30,000**:
- Federal Tax Credit (30%): \( 30,000 \times 0.30 = 9,000 \, \text{USD} \).
- Net System Cost: \( 30,000 - 9,000 = 21,000 \, \text{USD} \).

**Payback Period**:
- \( 21,000 \, \text{USD} \div 2,533.50 \, \text{USD/year} = \text{~8.3 years} \).

---

### **Environmental Impact**
1. **Carbon Offset**:
   - 14,215.4 kWh/year offsets ~10.08 metric tons of CO₂ annually (EPA conversion: 0.0007 metric tons CO₂ per kWh).
2. **Equivalent Trees Planted**:
   - This is equivalent to planting ~167 trees per year.

---

### **Summary**
A **12.6 kW solar array** in Potomac, MD, with site efficiency of **1129 kWh per kWp** would:
- Generate **14,215.4 kWh/year**.
- Offset your entire electricity usage and export **2,935.4 kWh/year**.
- Provide annual savings and income of **$2,533.50/year**.
- Pay for itself in **~8.3 years**, with ongoing financial and environmental benefits.
