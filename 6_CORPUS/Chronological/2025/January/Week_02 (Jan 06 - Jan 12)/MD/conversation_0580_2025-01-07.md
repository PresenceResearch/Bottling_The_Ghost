please consolidate and summarize meeting notes.  I'm interested in your thoughts on priorities and action items.  

OK.  First item was pipeline management.  We are using a salesforce platform that does not work for us and we need to mirror it to the residential model.  New prospects are put in as leads and then transferred to opportunities when discovery calls are schduled.  When entering the lead there need to be specific campaigns relevant to the commercial division.  For example, drop downs for referral partner, specific lead vendor, or employee, for example.  Once the opportunity os created there will be a field to populate with the referral fee.  Second is estimating.  

We need to closely align with operation to understand what their needs are.  If we have a process and/or a checklist this will make life easier for everyone.  In order to achieve this we need to integrate with the operations team.  Activities will include creating a checklist compiled by operations and sales together, visiting installations and learning firsthand what is done and the challenges they have.  Joining site visits to shadow estimator and look at what he needs to know so that we can mirror that process without him.  Attend a morning operations meeting before they leave for the job.  Introduce ourselves and ask them how we can do our jobs better.

Here’s a consolidated summary of the meeting notes with suggested priorities and action items:

---

### **Meeting Notes Summary**

#### **1. Pipeline Management**
- **Issue:** Current Salesforce platform is not effective for the commercial division. The goal is to align it with the residential model.
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - **Lead Handling:** New prospects are entered as leads, then converted to opportunities when discovery calls are scheduled.
  - **Specific Campaigns:** Create dropdown options for lead sources (e.g., referral partner, lead vendor, or employee).
  - **Referral Fees:** Add a field in opportunities to capture referral fees.

#### **2. Estimating Process**
- **Issue:** Sales and operations are not fully aligned, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Proposed Actions:**
  - **Checklist Creation:** Collaborate with operations to compile a comprehensive checklist for estimating.
  - **Shadowing and Training:**
    - Attend site visits to observe the estimator's process and challenges.
    - Participate in installation visits for firsthand learning.
  - **Operations Team Collaboration:**
    - Join morning operations meetings to gather feedback and build rapport with the team.

---

### **Priorities**
1. **Pipeline Management:**
   - Update the Salesforce platform to include lead handling and campaign-specific fields.
   - Ensure the referral fee field is implemented for opportunities.
   - Align with residential model to streamline processes.

2. **Estimating and Collaboration with Operations:**
   - Develop the checklist in collaboration with the operations team.
   - Build bridges with the operations team by attending their meetings and site visits.
   - Empower the sales team to understand the estimator’s role and challenges to improve accuracy and efficiency.

---

### **Action Items**
1. **Pipeline Management:**
   - Define the specific dropdown options for lead sources and ensure technical feasibility with Salesforce.
   - Implement and test the referral fee field.
   - Schedule training sessions for the sales team to familiarize them with the updated process.

2. **Operations Integration:**
   - Coordinate with operations leadership to schedule checklist development meetings.
   - Arrange for sales team members to attend installations, site visits, and morning meetings.
   - Gather feedback from the operations team on current challenges and potential improvements.

---

### **Key Thoughts**
- Aligning pipeline management with the residential model will simplify the sales process and improve lead tracking.
- Building a stronger relationship with operations is critical for a seamless estimating process. Hands-on learning and collaboration will foster better understanding and trust.
- The proposed actions are practical and actionable, but regular check-ins and iterative feedback will be essential for long-term success.

We need to closely align with operation to understand what their needs are.  If we have a process and/or a checklist this will make life easier for everyone.  In order to achieve this we need to integrate with the operations team.  Activities will include creating a checklist compiled by operations and sales together, visiting installations and learning firsthand what is done and the challenges they have.  Joining site visits to shadow estimator and look at what he needs to know so that we can mirror that process without him.  Attend a morning operations meeting before they leave for the job.  Introduce ourselves and ask them how we can do our jobs better.  

For Financing it was pretty simple.  They can actively have conversations with potential partners but need to bring me into the conversation early on.  We will also pick 3-4 projects and visit Claire at SunRock and see what kind of pricing we can get from her.  I would like to utilize her firm more but as of now her pricing is garbage

Project management - we are uncertain of our role in the project management process.  Theoretically we should be minimally involved however that is often not the case.  There is no process or integration plan, so sales and operations are siloed, we never communicate.  Given this challenge and the pricing and project selection problems I need to design, schedule and execute a sales and operations summit,  probably for 3-4 hours in the office.  The agenda will stem from these notes and other items

Meeting structures:  written items by reps by 10am mondays so we are accountable and I have an idea of what they are working on and how I can help.  10:30 sales meeting in the residential office on Tuesdays following EOS meeting format.  Dashboards will come from Salesforce, which need to be upadated and further customized.  Pl;ease include this in the ssalesforce list of to-dos.  Lastly, we will informally meet on Thursdays in the Commercial office to review the week.

Sales goals.  I took the approach of working backwards from individual compensation.  The dollar goal per year per rep on the optimal model is $5,400,000.  If they are paid out at the par rate of 3%, the total annual commission would be $162,300.  Add their $50,000 salary and that is $210,300 at the top level.  Our goal is for everyone to make $300,000 thius year and need to understand how that can happen

we have discussed a bonus program.  If the team meets 100% of it's kW goal for the quarter (1200 kW) there will be a bonus.  However where I struggled was ho to incorporate the other two metrics into the bonus situation, and how to separate individual bonuses from team bonuses.  There are too many variables, I believe, to make it fair.  

I need to justify increasing each rep's salary from $50k per year to $100k.  As you can see by the meeting items, we are responsible for so many jobs that are not directly revenue generating and need to be compensated accordingly.  Can you look at these notes and identify the tasks not directly related to selling and take time away from selling?  Please include that we are responsible for all lead generation which involves prospecting and business development

in this same conversation it is worth noting that the residential sales and marketing budget annually is $2,400,000 and they are forecast to bring in $41,000,000 in revenue at a gross margin of 35%.  My sales and marketing budget is $120,000 per year with our expected revenue of $9,272,500 at a gross margin of 33%.  Can you tell me what my sales and marketing budget should be if it was exactly proportional to the residential sales and marketing budget?

Here’s an organized analysis of your meeting notes, focusing on priorities, action items, and the requested calculations:

---

### **Consolidated Meeting Notes**

- **Goals:**
  - Establish a shared process and checklist for estimating and installations.
  - Enhance collaboration between sales and operations through integration efforts.
- **Proposed Actions:**
  - Create a checklist in collaboration with operations.
  - Participate in installations and shadow the estimator to understand their process.
  - Attend morning operations meetings to gather feedback and build rapport.
  - Organize a **Sales and Operations Summit** to address challenges, improve communication, and develop an integration plan (3-4 hours).

#### **2. Financing**
- **Goals:**
  - Foster relationships with financing partners and improve pricing outcomes.
- **Proposed Actions:**
  - Ensure early involvement of the director in financing conversations.
  - Select 3-4 projects and meet with Claire at SunRock to negotiate better pricing.

#### **3. Project Management**
- **Issues:**
  - Unclear role in the project management process.
  - Lack of communication and integration between sales and operations.
- **Proposed Actions:**
  - Clarify roles and responsibilities during the Sales and Operations Summit.
  - Develop a process and integration plan to reduce silos and streamline collaboration.

#### **4. Meeting Structures**
- **Weekly Schedule:**
  - Reps submit written updates by 10 a.m. on Mondays for accountability.
  - Tuesday sales meetings in the residential office (EOS format).
  - Thursday informal reviews in the commercial office.
- **Salesforce:**
  - Further customize dashboards to support reporting and accountability.

#### **5. Sales Goals & Compensation**
- **Goals:**
  - Increase annual rep compensation to $300,000.
  - Target individual revenue of $5,400,000/year per rep under optimal conditions.
- **Bonus Program:**
  - Current plan ties bonuses to quarterly kW goals (1,200 kW).
  - Struggling to incorporate other metrics (individual/team performance) into a fair bonus system.

#### **6. Justifying Salary Increases**
- **Key Considerations:**
  - Reps handle significant non-revenue-generating tasks that take time away from selling.
  - Responsibilities include:
    - Lead generation and prospecting.
    - Business development.
    - Administrative tasks like updating Salesforce, attending non-sales meetings, and integrating with operations.

#### **7. Budget Analysis**
- **Residential Budget:**
  - $2,400,000 for $41,000,000 in revenue (5.85% of revenue).
- **Commercial Budget:**
  - $120,000 for $9,272,500 in revenue (1.29% of revenue).

**Proportional Budget Calculation:**
- If the commercial division’s budget were proportional:
  - \( 9,272,500 \times 5.85\% = 541,746 \)

Your budget should be **$541,746** for proportional parity.

---

### **Priorities**
1. **Sales and Operations Summit:**
   - Address alignment, role clarification, and process improvement.
2. **Salesforce Enhancements:**
   - Implement campaign tracking, referral fee fields, and dashboard updates.
3. **Justify Salary Increases:**
   - Document time spent on non-sales tasks and compare to residential reps' compensation structure.
4. **Budget Advocacy:**
   - Use proportional budget analysis to push for increased resources.

---

### **Action Items**
1. **Operations Collaboration:**
   - Schedule a summit and finalize its agenda.
   - Begin checklist development and set dates for shadowing and site visits.
2. **Salesforce Customization:**
   - Update campaign-specific fields, referral fees, and dashboards.
3. **Compensation Justification:**
   - List non-revenue tasks for reps and quantify their impact on sales time.
4. **Financing Outreach:**
   - Schedule a meeting with Claire at SunRock for pricing review.
5. **Budget Proposal:**
   - Present proportional analysis to request an increased commercial budget.
