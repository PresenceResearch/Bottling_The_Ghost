The Washington, D.C. Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) market has undergone significant changes aimed at promoting solar energy adoption and ensuring market stability.

**Increased Solar Carve-Out**

In March 2023, the District enacted the Local Solar Expansion Amendment Act of 2022 (B24-0950), which raised the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) solar carve-out from 10% to 15% by 2041. This means that by 2041, 15% of the District's electricity must come from solar energy sources. citeturn0search0

**Adjusted Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) Schedule**

The same legislation also revised the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) schedule. Previously set at $500 per megawatt-hour (MWh) through 2023, the SACP will now decrease more gradually, starting at $480 in 2024 and reducing by $20 each subsequent year until it reaches $300. This adjustment aims to provide a more predictable and stable pricing environment for SRECs, encouraging investment in solar projects. citeturn0search5

**Market Stability and Investor Confidence**

These changes address previous market instability caused by oversupply and lack of liquidity. By increasing the RPS targets and implementing a gradual SACP reduction, the District aims to balance supply and demand, leading to a more stable SREC market and increased investor confidence. citeturn0search0

**Current SREC Prices**

As of January 2025, SREC prices in Washington, D.C., are approximately $410 per SREC. This pricing reflects the market's response to the updated RPS targets and SACP adjustments. citeturn0search9

These developments indicate a strong commitment by Washington, D.C., to expanding solar energy adoption and maintaining a robust SREC market, which is beneficial for solar sales professionals and investors in the region.

**Contract Options**

Several firms facilitate long-term SREC contracts in Washington, D.C., each offering distinct terms:
