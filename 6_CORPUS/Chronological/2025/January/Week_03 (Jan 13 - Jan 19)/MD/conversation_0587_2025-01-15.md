A horn player with over 20 years of experience,  
Freelancing in the heart of New York City—  
From the dazzling lights of Broadway to the grand halls of the MET Opera,

[Intro, Sitar and tabla, Calm and reflective]  
Namaste, I’m Sheila Abate,  
A horn player with over 20 years of experience,  
Performing across the vibrant stages of New York City—  
From the soulful melodies of Broadway  
To the majestic harmonies of the MET Opera,  
And the vivid stories of film scores.  

[Verse 1, Sitar melody intertwines with tabla, Serene flow]  
My journey has been anything but ordinary,  
A path shaped by passion and dedication.  
Every performance, every note I played,  
Became a step in my search for meaning,  
A rhythm that led me to something profound.  

[Bridge, Rising sitar phrases, Tabla intensifies slightly, Inspirational tone]  
Today, my focus has shifted—  
From playing music to sharing its power.  
As an Assistant Professor at Berklee College of Music,

In the heart of Baltimore,  
I bring music to children who long for hope,  
To voices waiting to be heard.  

[Chorus, Vibrant sitar crescendo, Tabla syncopation, Uplifting energy]  
Music is my offering, my connection to the world.  
It is a bridge between hearts,  
A light that awakens creativity and courage.  
Through teaching, I carry its spirit forward,  
Inspiring dreams where silence once lived.  

[Instrumental Interlude, Sitar solo with tabla, Bright and lively]

Whether performing on grand stages  
Or teaching in the smallest of rooms,

To celebrate the power of sound.  

[Final Chorus, Sitar and tabla in joyous unison, Anthemic and proud]  
This is my dharma, my journey, my truth:  
To connect, to inspire, to uplift.

A musician, a teacher, a dreamer.  
And through the journey of a single note,  
I hope to create a world full of harmony.

**Title**: *The Horn Player’s Aria*  
**Style of Music**: Classical, inspired by Mozart opera, light orchestration with strings, woodwinds, and horn accompaniment, female spoken/sung voice in a recitative and aria structure  

```  
[Overture, Light orchestral introduction with strings, woodwinds, and horns, Playful yet elegant]  

[Recitative, Strings and woodwinds softly accompany spoken narration]  
Ah, allow me to tell my tale—  
I am Sheila Abate, a player of the horn,  
With over two decades of melodies,  
From New York's bustling stages,  
To the grandeur of opera halls,  
To the whispers of cinema’s soundtracks.  
A life shaped by music,  
Each note a step on my unique path.  

[Aria, Strings swell gently, Horns echo the melody, Warm and lyrical tone]  
Oh, the horn, so golden and bright,  
It sings of joy, it cries of night.  
On Broadway's lights or opera's stage,  
Each note I play turns another page.  
(Spoken) Yet life has shifted, oh, how it turns,  
From performance halls to where passion burns.  

[Transition, Playful woodwinds and pizzicato strings, Building energy]  

[Recitative, Strings soften, gentle and inspiring tone]  
Now I teach, at Berklee’s noble halls,  
Guiding young souls through music's calls.  
And in Baltimore, where hope takes root,  
I teach children to find their truth.  
Through melody and rhythm, they learn to dream,  
A spark ignited, a life redeemed.  

[Aria, Full orchestral accompaniment, Majestic and uplifting]  
Oh, the joy of teaching, a sacred art,  
To awaken the fire in every heart.  
To give the gift that music bestows,  
To let creativity freely flow.  
Whether I play or teach, it’s the same,  
Inspiring others is my ultimate aim.  

[Finale, Orchestral crescendo with triumphant horns, Grand resolution]  
This is my story, my life’s refrain,  
Through music, I strive to heal and sustain.  
From stage to classroom, the purpose is clear,  
To leave behind harmony for all who hear.  
Ah, the horn, so golden and bright,  
Forever my companion, my guiding light.  

[Outro, Gentle strings and solo horn, Quiet and reverent fade]  
And so, the music carries on,  
A song of hope, long after I am gone.
