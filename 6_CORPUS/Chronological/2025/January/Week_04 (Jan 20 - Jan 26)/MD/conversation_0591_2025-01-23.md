I had to raise the price because the original price I proposed was wildly inaccurate.  upon redoinng the pricing for the project, we have had to update the system footprint which requires new engineering and additional racking.  We have also been required due to new code interpretation to affix mesh on the back of the panel which increases cost and labor time.  We have also increased gross margin significantly, but I don't want to tell the client this.  Can you help me create a proposal comparing the new (2025) cost stack with the old one (2021)?  Please explain why costs have increased avoiding the significant increase in gross margin
