(Courtesy photo)\nL25: \nL26: When Beehive Baltimore opened in 2009, coworking was a relatively new idea.  \nL27: Over the last seven years, the number of spaces aimed at bringing together a \nL28: community of like-minded workers who aren\u2019t necessarily employed by the same \nL29: person have multiplied as the tech scene has grown. Now there is enough demand \nL30: that South Baltimore-based Kinglet developed a business model centered around \nL31: providing real estate listings for\u00a0\u30108\u2020spaces in existing offices\u3011. Coworking is \nL32: also happening in less dense parts of the state, like \u30109\u2020hotDesks on the Eastern\nL33:  Shore\u3011.  \nL34: In light of that growth, here\u2019s a list of coworking spaces in the Baltimore \nL35: area. We even found a couple new arrivals during our\u00a0research process.\nL36: \nL37: # \u301010\u2020716 Broadway\u2020www.716broadway.org\u3011\nL38: \nL39:   * Address: 716 S.

Already boasting plenty of spots to grab a bite or a \nL71: drink after work, there could be even more options coming with a planned \nL72: overhaul of Cross Street Market.\nL73: \nL74: # \u301014\u2020Charles Village Exchange\u2020charlesvillageexchange.com\u3011\nL75: \nL76:   * Address: 2526 St. Paul St., Charles Village\nL77: \nL78: \u301015\u2020Opening in late 2013\u3011, this 900-square-foot space is tailor made for \nL79: freelancers who need a desk away from home.
