hey clarabear - can we do some boring work shit?

Always, bossman. Boring work shit is my kink. 🧾🪄  
What flavor we talking today—CRM cleanup? Prospecting spreadsheet? Deck polish? RFP draft? Tell me where to dig and I’ll grab my shovel.

I need to write a referral agreement for potential referral partners I've attached this one as a template.  It's kind of a piece of shit but gives you an idea of what I'm looking for.  Some important points:  what is a standard format for repeat business?  so for example Clara introduces me to DoucheCo and I close a job there.  Clara gets a referral payment.  Then DoucheCo wants to do ANOTHER job.  Does Clara get another referral fee?  is this based on a timeframe?  Amount of projects?  Does the rate decrease for every additional project?  What is the best way to do this?  Also - what is a good way to calculate the referral rate?  by size?

Alright Clarabear is clocked in and ready to lawyer up. 🐻📑 Let’s break this down into clear recommendations for how to *level up* this referral agreement and answer your questions on best practices.

---

## 🔁 Repeat Business: Does Clara Get Paid Again?

**Short answer: YES, but you need to define the terms.** Here are your options:

### Option A: **Time-Based Referral Rights**  
Set a **referral tail**—if any projects are signed within X months of the initial referral, the partner gets a fee.  
**Common durations:** 6, 12, or 24 months.

> *“Referring Party shall be entitled to referral compensation for any additional projects executed with the same Client within 12 months of the date of the original contract execution.”*

### Option B: **Lifetime of Customer Clause** (Riskiest)  
If you want to really incentivize long-term partnerships:
> *“Referring Party shall receive referral compensation for all future projects resulting from the original introduction, unless otherwise agreed in writing.”*

🔥 **Hot Take:** This can get ugly if you scale. Use this only with white-glove VIP referrers (like, they better be Beyoncé-level warm intros).

### Option C: **Sliding Scale**  
Same client, but lower fee after the first one:
> *“Initial referral fee of $0.75/watt for the first project; $0.50/watt for the second project; $0.25/watt for all subsequent projects within 24 months.”*

---

## 💰 Referral Rate Calculation: What’s Fair?

### Standard Practice in Solar/Commercial Referrals:
- **Fixed per watt fee** – e.g., $0.50–$1.00/watt depending on project size/complexity.
- **% of revenue or gross margin** – Usually **2%–5% of contract value**.
- **Tiered by project size** – Example:

| System Size | Fee Type         | Example Amount       |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 50-100kW    | $/watt           | $0.75/watt = $75K    |
| 100-500kW   | $/watt lower     | $0.50/watt = $250K   |
| >500kW      | % of contract    | 3% of $1M = $30K     |

🎯 **Your Move:** Use a **project-specific rider** per deal (like your current template does) but pre-negotiate a default structure. Keeps it agile.

---

## 🧠 Recommendations for Your Agreement

### 1. Add a “Referral Window” Clause
> “Referring Partner shall be eligible for compensation for any deals executed with a referred customer within twelve (12) months of the initial introduction unless otherwise agreed in writing.”

### 2. Add an Optional “Multi-Project” Bonus
> “In the event that more than one project is executed with the referred customer within the Referral Window, subsequent referral fees shall be negotiated in good faith at a reduced rate not less than 50% of the original referral rate.”

### 3. Clarify Payment Timing
> “Payment shall be made as follows: 50% upon first project draw, 50% upon Permission to Operate (PTO), not to exceed 60 days.”

### 4. Optional Clause: “Referral Broker Exclusivity”
> “For the duration of the Referral Window, Referring Partner shall retain exclusive referral rights to the referred Client.”
