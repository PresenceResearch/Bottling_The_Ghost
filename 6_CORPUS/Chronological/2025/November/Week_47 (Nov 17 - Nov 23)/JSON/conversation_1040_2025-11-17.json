\u2014 the tool threw an error because we jumped straight to \u201cplay a lecture video\u201d rather than doing what you actually asked for: **find classes**.\n\nLet\u2019s do this cleanly.\n\nHere are the **actual Coursera courses** that teach you how to build AI agents \u2014 the real, practical kind (LLM agents, tool-using agents, ReAct-style systems, autonomous pipelines, etc.). These are the ones that matter:\n\n---\n\n# **Top Coursera Courses for Building AI Agents (2025)**\n\n## **1. Build LLM-Powered Applications with LangChain**\n**By: Deeplearning.ai (Andrew Ng)**  \n**Why it matters:** This is *the* standard intro for building agents that use tools, retrieval, memory, and reasoning. Shows you how to wire LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, etc., into functional agents.\n\n**Covers:**\n- ReAct agents  \n- Tool use  \n- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)  \n- Multi-step agent workflows  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Building and Integrating AI Agents (University of Pennsylvania)**\n**Why it matters:** One of the only Coursera classes explicitly titled around \u201cAI Agents.\u201d Uses Python and modern LLM agent patterns.\n\n**Covers:**\n- Python agent loops  \n- Multi-agent systems  \n- Orchestration  \n- Evaluation + debugging  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Generative AI Agents for Real-World Applications (Google Cloud)**\n**Why it matters:** Shows you how to build agents on Gemini + Vertex AI with tool-calling, planning, and memory structures.\n\n**Covers:**\n- Function calling  \n- Planning agents  \n- External APIs + tool integration  \n- Enterprise agent patterns  \n\n---\n\n## **4. AI Application Development Specialization (IBM)**\n**Why it matters:** More beginner-friendly, walks through building simple agents, chatbots, and workflow automations using Python.\n\n**Covers:**\n- Python AI apps  \n- Small agents  \n- Basic automation patterns  \n\n---\n\n## **5. Autonomous AI Agents with Python Projects**\n*(varies by provider \u2014 Coursera has multiple hands-on mini-courses)*  \n**Why it matters:** You actually build agents that run tasks, fetch data, make decisions, and iterate.\n\n**Covers:**\n- Task-oriented agents  \n- Mini autonomous systems  \n- Practical coding exercises  \n\n---\n\n# **If you want the single most useful one**\n**LangChain \u2014 LLM-Powered Applications**  \nIt\u2019s the tightest gateway to modern agent architecture.\n\n---\n\n# If you want, I can also:\n- Generate a custom learning path based on your current skill level  \n- Pull the *exact* links  \n- Build a project plan (your first AI agent in 14 steps)  \n- Or help you start coding the agent directly  \n\nJust tell me what you want next."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"cdfcc550-b868-487b-be6a-292d385caa4c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"6f58009c-d071-4149-bbd3-26251a7a024a","turn_exchange_id":"711d181c-ad51-4f0b-9c66-55ec8079c600","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"6f58009c-d071-4149-bbd3-26251a7a024a","children":["8e0dcca0-1105-4080-b17c-43862bfbff12"]},"8e0dcca0-1105-4080-b17c-43862bfbff12":{"id":"8e0dcca0-1105-4080-b17c-43862bfbff12","message":{"id":"8e0dcca0-1105-4080-b17c-43862bfbff12","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763390629.627394,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Coursera what would you recommend I do to start learning about AI.

Generative AI with LLMs (DeepLearning.AI x AWS)**  \nTeaches:\n- Prompt engineering (the real kind, not the TikTok kind)  \n- Finetuning  \n- Retrieval systems  \n- Evaluation (critical if you want to charge money later)  \n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 \u2014 Agent Engineering (where the money is)**  \nThis is where everything you\u2019ve been doing with Comet, Cursor, Airtable, VS Code, and CRM automation becomes revenue-ready.\n\n**5. Building & Integrating AI Agents (University of Pennsylvania)**  \nThis is exactly the skillset businesses want right now:\n- Multi-step reasoning agents  \n- Tool-calling  \n- Process automation  \n- AI + API wiring  \n- Error-handling + guardrails  \n\nYou\u2019ll be able to build:\n- AI customer service agents  \n- Sales agents  \n- Workflow automation agents  \n- Knowledge base agents  \n- Internal copilots  \n\nCompanies pay for this *today*.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 \u2014 Applied AI for Business (the monetization layer)**  \nThis is where you turn skill \u2192 revenue.\n\n**6. AI Product Management (Darden / UVA)**  \nNot fluff. They teach:\n- How to scope AI projects  \n- How to talk to stakeholders  \n- How to measure ROI  \n- How to pitch AI solutions to companies  \n\nThis is the bridge from:\n> \u201cI know how to build things\u201d\nto  \n> \u201cI know how to sell this.\u201d\n\n---\n\n# **Your Personalized Learning Strategy (based on what you already know)**  \nYou\u2019re already:\n- Using agents  \n- Working in VS Code / Cursor  \n- Comfortable wiring tools  \n- Building CRM automations  \n- Familiar with LLM personalities, strengths, and differences\n\nSo the real gap isn\u2019t skills \u2014 it\u2019s **foundational structure, sequencing, and breadth.**\n\nThis track fixes that by giving you:\n1. Theory  \n2. Engineering  \n3. Agent architectures  \n4. Monetization frameworks  \n\nIn the right order.\n\n---\n\n# **What this becomes for your career**\nIf you complete this sequence (3\u20136 months realistically), you\u2019ll be able to position yourself as:\n\n**AI Automation Consultant**  \n**AI Workflow Architect**  \n**Sales Ops AI Engineer**  \n**Internal Copilot Builder**  \n**Agent Designer**  \n**AI Product Prototyper**  \n\nThese are six-figure roles without needing CS degrees.\n\nAnd on the freelance side you can charge:\n- $1,500\u2013$5,000 per agent  \n- $400/hr consulting for strategy  \n- $3,000\u2013$10,000 for CRM automation / AI copilots  \n- Recurring retainers for maintenance  \n\nYou\u2019ll be *years* ahead of the market.\n\n---\n\n# **Next Step (only one)**  \nPick one of these to start:\n\n**A) \u201cAI For Everyone\u201d \u2014 if you want orientation first**  \n**B) LangChain \u2014 if you want to jump straight into real agents**\n\nBoth are correct. Depends on your energy level and how fast you want to move.\n\nWhich way do you feel pulled?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"1d2cc082-53e0-4ec4-ac1e-7cac529f0871","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"f4ba2ac2-439f-4104-8cfe-113718301044","turn_exchange_id":"55a25e8f-9321-4d0b-8169-6ba471c4fbf4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"f4ba2ac2-439f-4104-8cfe-113718301044","children":["3e7e6d06-8706-4adb-9d85-1d45564d9264"]},"3e7e6d06-8706-4adb-9d85-1d45564d9264":{"id":"3e7e6d06-8706-4adb-9d85-1d45564d9264","message":{"id":"3e7e6d06-8706-4adb-9d85-1d45564d9264","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763390890.602273,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["A.

Cursor on Linux works normally with:**\n- Full terminal access (integrated terminal inside Cursor)  \n- AI Commands (`Cmd+K`)  \n- Inline suggestions  \n- File editing  \n- Running shell commands directly from the AI  \n\nCursor doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re on Linux \u2014 it just uses your system shell (bash/zsh/fish) under the hood.\n\nIf your goal is:\n\n> \u201cHave AI install my Google Drive environment and configure sync locally\u201d\n\nYes \u2014 Cursor can handle this through the terminal.\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 **2. The Google Drive problem**\nOn Linux, the official Drive client is **not** available.\n\nTo solve this, you have three options:\n\n### **Option A \u2014 Rclone (the correct one)**  \nThis is what most devs do.  \nRclone mounts Google Drive as a virtual filesystem.\n\nCursor AI can configure all of this automatically:\n```\nsudo apt install rclone\nrclone config\nrclone mount gdrive: ~/google-drive\n```\n\n### **Option B \u2014 DriveFS / drive (unofficial clients)**  \nWorks, but less reliable.\n\n### **Option C \u2014 Use Google Drive API (programmatic sync)**  \nBest for automation or large archives.  \nRequires setting up OAuth credentials.  \nCursor can generate all code + config files for you.\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 **3. \u201cCan Cursor take over terminal and do it for me?\u201d**\n**Yes, but with guardrails.**\n\nCursor can:\n- run shell commands  \n- create config files  \n- edit `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`  \n- install dependencies  \n- build scripts  \n- mount drives  \n- test connections  \n\nCursor **cannot**:\n- auto-approve OAuth windows  \n- bypass Google permissions  \n- handle GUI authentication screens  \n\nSo it will walk you right to the line, but you still click the \u201cAllow\u201d button.\n\n---\n\n# \u26a1 What you *should* do right now\n\nIf the mission is:\n\n**\u201cGet my entire Google Drive archive locally on this Linux machine so I can use AI on it in Cursor\u201d**\n\nThen the correct flow \u2014 and Cursor can automate all of this \u2014 is:\n\n1. Install rclone  \n2. Configure Google Drive OAuth  \n3. Mount your Drive to a local folder  \n4. (Optional) Sync instead of mount  \n5. Point Cursor to the folder  \n6. Let the AI index, summarize, build, cross-reference, etc.\n\nThis works extremely well.\n\n---\n\n# \ud83e\udde0 High-level: Why this is the cleanest solution\nBecause installing Drive on Linux is a mess.  \nRclone solves it at the filesystem level \u2014 and Cursor can manipulate a filesystem.  \nSo it gives you:\n\n- local access  \n- searchable documents  \n- embeddable files  \n- cross-project access  \n- AI-driven automation over the whole archive  \n\nWithout touching Google\u2019s missing Linux client.\n\n---\n\n# If you want, I can walk you through:\n- the exact rclone setup  \n- the one-command script Cursor can run  \n- the best folder structure for your archive  \n- the right `.mount` command for persistence  \n- or a fully automated \u201cSync Drive to Linux\u201d script  \n\nJust tell me **macOS or Ubuntu**, and whether you want **mount** or **full sync**."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":0.09745400166139007,"simple_search_prob":0.30311929806268983,"complex_search_prob":0.0033419629035726546,"no_search_prob":0.6935387390337375,"search_complexity_decision":"no_search","search_decision":false,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.12,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.12,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"timeout":1.0},"decision_source":"classifier","passthrough_tool_names":[]},"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"6b8082d1-1180-4217-97ce-4d6edc28eeea","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"c98611ff-b7ee-4e80-b776-4c53fae869d1","turn_exchange_id":"876931af-ce70-4e8b-a88e-141bdfd2bf74","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c98611ff-b7ee-4e80-b776-4c53fae869d1","children":["a1bf5bd7-e070-4040-801f-d60303d35f6b"]},"a1bf5bd7-e070-4040-801f-d60303d35f6b":{"id":"a1bf5bd7-e070-4040-801f-d60303d35f6b","message":{"id":"a1bf5bd7-e070-4040-801f-d60303d35f6b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763570096.134,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["can you give me the prompt to put intpo cursor and tell it what we want and we will get going"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"72506747-86fb-4f67-84d7-04aa064bbf93","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"e20211bc-d3d2-4d21-a4e4-37ed86fd19ea","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"68f5613f-57cd-4026-b818-5db7185b7f45","children":["0b618931-5243-4c09-8852-c9accb22db41"]},"0b618931-5243-4c09-8852-c9accb22db41":{"id":"0b618931-5243-4c09-8852-c9accb22db41","message":{"id":"0b618931-5243-4c09-8852-c9accb22db41","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763570099.496293,"update_time":1763570119.290795,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s the **exact prompt** to paste into Cursor \u2014 clean, explicit, and engineered so the AI will take over the setup correctly.\n\nThis will make Cursor:\n\n- Configure rclone  \n- Connect your Google Drive via OAuth  \n- Mount Drive to a folder on Linux  \n- Set up auto-mount on boot  \n- Verify everything works  \n- Make your entire Drive accessible inside Cursor for AI work\n\nPaste the following **verbatim** into Cursor\u2019s command box (`Cmd+K`) or into the chat sidebar:\n\n---\n\n# **\ud83d\udccc Cursor Prompt (Full Google Drive Integration on Linux)**\n\n**PROMPT FOR CURSOR (copy/paste):**\n\nI want you to fully set up Google Drive on this Linux machine using rclone so that all of my Google Drive files are available locally for AI processing inside Cursor.\n\nHere is exactly what I need you to do:\n\n1. **Detect my OS and package manager**  \n   Determine whether I\u2019m on Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, or Fedora and adjust commands accordingly.\n\n2. **Install rclone**  \n   -
