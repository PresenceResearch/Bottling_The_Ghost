            "In Ukrainian, the term \"health insurance deductible\" can be translated as \"\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043c \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\". Let's break down the concept:\n\n1. **Health Insurance (\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432'\u044f):** This refers to a type of insurance that covers medical expenses incurred by the insured individual.\n\n2. **Deductible (\u0412\u0456\u0434\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043c \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c):** In the context of health insurance, a deductible is the amount of money that the insured person must pay out of pocket before the insurance company begins to cover eligible expenses. It's essentially a threshold that needs to be crossed before the insurance benefits kick in.\n\nFor example, if you have a health insurance policy with a deductible of 1000 hryvnias, you would need to personally pay the first 1000 hryvnias of your medical expenses. Once you reach or exceed this deductible amount, the insurance coverage starts to apply, and the insurance company will typically cover a percentage or the full amount of eligible expenses, depending on the terms of the policy.\n\nPlease note that the specific translation may vary, and it's always a good idea to consult with a Ukrainian-speaking insurance professional for precise terminology in a given context."

            "Certainly! A health insurance deductible is the amount of money that an insured individual must pay out of their own pocket for covered health care services before their insurance plan starts to contribute to the costs. In other words, it's a specified annual amount that the insured person is responsible for paying before the insurance coverage takes effect.\n\nHere's how it generally works:\n\n1. **Selection of Deductible:** When you enroll in a health insurance plan, you may be able to choose a deductible amount. This could vary depending on the specific plan and the terms outlined by the insurance company.\n\n2. **Out-of-Pocket Payments:** Until the insured person reaches the deductible amount, they are responsible for paying the full cost of covered medical expenses. This includes services like doctor visits, prescription medications, and certain medical procedures.\n\n3. **Insurance Coverage Activates:** Once the individual has paid the full amount of their deductible for the year, the insurance coverage begins. The insurance company will then start sharing the cost of covered services with the insured person, typically through a co-insurance arrangement or other cost-sharing mechanisms.\n\nIt's essential to review the terms of your specific health insurance plan, as deductibles can vary widely. Some preventive services may be covered without requiring payment toward the deductible, depending on the plan. Additionally, different types of services or providers may have separate deductible requirements.\n\nUnderstanding your health insurance deductible is crucial for managing your healthcare expenses and making informed decisions about your medical care."
