This performance guarantee is further detailed in Exhibit H of the contract\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Liquidated Damages (Shortfall Payment)**: If the project's generation for any Output Measurement Period falls below the Performance Threshold, the Design-Builder is obligated to pay the Owner an amount equal to $0.10 per kWh for the shortfall in generation up to the Performance Threshold. This Shortfall Payment is required to be made no later than fifteen days after the end of each Output Measurement Period.
