It's one of the easiest ways businesses and farms can keep \u301018\u2020installation costs\u3011 down, ROIs high, and paybacks short.\u00a0\n\nPut simply, depreciation is a decline in an asset\u2019s value over time. Your business can use this to recover costs from purchases as the equipment\u2019s value degrades throughout its lifetime. \n\nThere are a few different ways to expense depreciation, but we\u2019re going to focus on depreciating your solar system using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS depreciation, with a portion of the federal benefits accelerated to year one.\n\nAt Paradise Energy, we are expert solar installation professionals, not accountants. We give the most accurate outlook we can based on the financial information provided to us by our customers, but before making any decisions on how to expense depreciation, we recommend checking with your accountant first. \n\nA word to homeowners looking to go solar: depreciation is not generally allowed on residences unless it is considered a business expense.\n\n## Accelerated Bonus Depreciation for Commercial Solar Installations\n\n### What is the Depreciation Rate for a Commercial Solar System?\u00a0\n\nAs a business leader, you understand the importance of making strategic investments that yield both financial returns and environmental benefits. The type of investment you choose plays a significant role in the equation of determining the recovery period of your investment.  \n\nA commercial solar investment has the benefit of offering 60% bonus depreciation in year one on the federal level. The remaining balance will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule. On the state level, the depreciation will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0  \n\nCompared to many other business investments, solar energy provides a great tool for businesses to offset a significant portion of their tax liability in a relatively short period while also controlling a fixed cost.\u00a0\n\n### Is Solar Depreciation Calculated Before or After the Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)?\n\nBecause everything has a wonderful way of being simple and easy, the answer to this question is going to be either before or after, right? Not so much. The IRS reduces the basis for depreciation by one-half of the tax credit amount allowed. So since the tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% X .5]). For example, if your solar system costs $100,000, you would be able to depreciate $85,000 of the system cost.\u00a0\n\nNote: For property acquired after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023, the law allowed taxpayers to take a deduction amounting to 100%. That dropped to 80% in 2023 and will continue to step down by 20% each year until it reaches 0% in 2027.\n\n### Does the Production Tax Credit Impact Your Depreciable Basis?\n\nThe \u301019\u2020Production Tax Credit \u2020youtu.be\u3011(PTC) is an alternative to the 30% Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Instead of a lump sum 30% tax credit, the PTC pays a set amount per kWh over a ten-year span. Using the PTC typically makes the most sense for utility-scale solar systems.\n\nUnlike the ITC, claiming\u00a0the Production\u00a0Tax Credit does not reduce\u00a0your depreciable basis.\u00a0\n\n### Federal Depreciation vs State Depreciation For Commercial Solar\n\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act changed how we can depreciate solar on the federal level. Prior to 2023, businesses could depreciate 100% of the cost basis in the first year. Since then the accelerated depreciation base has decreased by 20% a year, leaving it at 60% in 2024. This will continue to decrease by 20% a year until it reaches 0% in 2027.\n\nBusinesses can still depreciate 100% of the cost basis, but the remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n[Image 3: Hear from an accountant that invested in solar.]\n\n## An Example of How Commercial Solar Depreciation Works\n\nLet\u2019s figure out the MACRS depreciation for a \u301020\u2020solar panel system that costs $300,000\u3011 before incentives. You\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the \u301021\u2020Federal Solar Incentive Tax Credit \u3011at 30%. But since we have to calculate depreciation with half of the tax credit, reducing the depreciable cost basis, we\u2019ll have to take 15% off the cost of the system to get the basis of depreciation. We can do this by multiplying the cost by 85%, which gives us $255,000.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to know your federal and state tax brackets. We\u2019ll use a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax for this example.\n\nTo calculate federal tax savings from depreciation, multiply the $255,000 by 24%. Because you can take advantage of 60% of this in the first year, you\u2019ll enjoy $36,720 in savings that will offset your tax liability the year that your solar system is placed into service. The remaining $24,480 of the depreciable amount will follow the MACRS schedule.\n\nTo get state savings, multiply $255,000 by your state tax rate, which in this case is 7%. You\u2019ll get $17,850 spread over the 5-year MACRS schedule.\n\nThat means the total savings from just depreciation would be $79,050. In this example, that\u2019s 26.3% of the entire solar system\u2019s cost! \u00a0\n\nRecovery Year Federal Depreciation State Depreciation Total Savings  \nYear 1 60% Federal 20% State $40,290  \nYear 2 20% of the remaining 40% 32% State $10,608  \nYear 3 32% of the remaining 40% 19.2% State $11,261  \nYear 4 19.2% of the remaining 40% 11.5% State $6,753  \nYear 5 11.5% of the remaining 40% 11.5% State $4,868  \nYear 6 11.5% of the remaining 40% 5.76% State $3,843  \nYear 7 5.76% of the remaining 40% 0% State $1,410  \n\nThese tax savings will keep your \u301022\u2020payback period short and your ROI high\u3011. You\u2019ll be able to use these savings to reduce a loan\u2019s principal owed or reinvest in your company.\n\nAre you ready to see how much you could save with solar? \u30107\u2020Use our Solar Savings Calculator\u3011 to get an instant price and savings estimate.\u00a0\n\n[Image 4: Use our solar savings calculator]\n\nLast Updated: December 22, 2023\n\n##  Related Blogs\n\n\u301023\u2020Solar for Businesses\u3011 |  10 min read \n\n## \u301017\u2020Commercial Solar 101: A Business' Guide To Investing In Solar Panels\u3011\n\nIf you're a business leader who's ready to control a fixed cost, pay fewer taxes, and be on your way to saving more of your hard-earned\n\n\u301024\u2020Andy Schell\u3011    \n\n\u301025\u2020Solar Equipment\u3011 |  4 min read \n\n## \u301026\u2020What Are The Different Types of Commercial Solar Installations?\u3011\n\nMany businesses' goals for going solar are the same: generate their own cost- and emissions-free electricity.

assets.\n\nPresident Biden signed the \u301068\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u3011 (IRA) into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA aims to limit inflation by reducing the deficit, investing in domestic energy production, and rewarding renewable energy. This article discusses how this landmark law impacts bonus depreciation and the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).\n\nTax professionals should be aware of these changes as they advise clients on capital investment and equipment purchases.\n\n## Three things to know about the new corporate AMT\n\n###### Bloomberg Tax Law Analyst Morgan Oliver, J.D., breaks down special rules for determining which corporations are subject to the CAMT, such as aggregating the income of all members in a closely related business group and employing an eligibility test for members of a foreign-parented multinational group.\n\n## Accelerated bonus depreciation\n\nAccelerated depreciation allows businesses to write off most property costs \u2013 vehicles, equipment, etc. \u2013 faster than under modified accelerated cost recovery (MACRS). The idea is that businesses can recoup part of these costs more quickly, allowing them to make capital investments that boost the economy while freeing up cash flow for other requirements.\n\nThe tax code has different methods of accelerated depreciation. One popular method is bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation lets businesses write off a portion of an asset\u2019s cost in its first year of use. A company can currently write off 100% of qualified equipment costs in the year it placed its service. This percentage is scheduled to drop to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, and 40% in 2025, until its wholly phased out in 2027.  \n\nThe IRA did not directly impact bonus depreciation. But it will impact accelerated depreciation deductions of large corporations via another aspect of the legislation: corporate AMT.\n\n### Corporate alternative minimum tax 2022\n\nCongress introduced the corporate AMT in 1986 to prevent large companies from using tax exemptions to avoid paying income taxes, despite high earnings. Corporate AMT was eventually repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nThe old version of the corporate AMT required companies to calculate their tax liability twice: once using the regular tax code and once using an alternative calculation without certain deductions. Then, the company paid whichever resulted in the highest tax bill.\n\nThe IRA of 2022 reintroduced the corporate AMT, but with major changes:\n\n  * It applies only to certain corporations (or a group of corporations treated as a single employer) with significant book-to-tax differences and a three-year average annual income over $1 billion from the prior three tax years.\n  * A company needs to pass the book income test only once to be subject to AMT. Unless the IRS specifies otherwise, it remains an applicable corporation.\n  * The new corporate AMT applies a 15% tax to a company\u2019s \u301069\u2020adjusted financial statement income\u2020irc.bloombergtax.com\u3011 (AFSI). AFSI is a company\u2019s net income or loss reported on it\u2019s applicable financial statements (AFS), such as a Form 10-K filed with the SEC, including tax and accounting adjustments. Accelerated depreciation is a tax adjustment (but not for book purposes).\n  * This aspect of the corporate AMT could substantially cut the minimum tax bill of corporations that invest heavily in the next few years. However, it will have less impact as bonus depreciation phases out unless Congress decides to extend it.\n  * The IRA either created or reinstated green energy \u301070\u2020tax credits\u3011. Combined with the AMT, these credits will affect corporations\u2019 decisions about bonus depreciation.\n\n### Bonus or no bonus\n\nDepreciation can factor into both regular and AMT tax calculations for corporations.\n\nSay a corporation wants to claim the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) before it expires at the end of 2024. However, the company must have tax liability in order to take advantage of t",

assets.\n\nPresident Biden signed the \u301068\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u3011 (IRA) into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA aims to limit inflation by reducing the deficit, investing in domestic energy production, and rewarding renewable energy. This article discusses how this landmark law impacts bonus depreciation and the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).\n\nTax professionals should be aware of these changes as they advise clients on capital investment and equipment purchases.\n\n## Three things to know about the new corporate AMT\n\n###### Bloomberg Tax Law Analyst Morgan Oliver, J.D., breaks down special rules for determining which corporations are subject to the CAMT, such as aggregating the income of all members in a closely related business group and employing an eligibility test for members of a foreign-parented multinational group.\n\n## Accelerated bonus depreciation\n\nAccelerated depreciation allows businesses to write off most property costs \u2013 vehicles, equipment, etc. \u2013 faster than under modified accelerated cost recovery (MACRS). The idea is that businesses can recoup part of these costs more quickly, allowing them to make capital investments that boost the economy while freeing up cash flow for other requirements.\n\nThe tax code has different methods of accelerated depreciation. One popular method is bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation lets businesses write off a portion of an asset\u2019s cost in its first year of use. A company can currently write off 100% of qualified equipment costs in the year it placed its service. This percentage is scheduled to drop to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, and 40% in 2025, until its wholly phased out in 2027.  \n\nThe IRA did not directly impact bonus depreciation. But it will impact accelerated depreciation deductions of large corporations via another aspect of the legislation: corporate AMT.\n\n### Corporate alternative minimum tax 2022\n\nCongress introduced the corporate AMT in 1986 to prevent large companies from using tax exemptions to avoid paying income taxes, despite high earnings. Corporate AMT was eventually repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nThe old version of the corporate AMT required companies to calculate their tax liability twice: once using the regular tax code and once using an alternative calculation without certain deductions. Then, the company paid whichever resulted in the highest tax bill.\n\nThe IRA of 2022 reintroduced the corporate AMT, but with major changes:\n\n  * It applies only to certain corporations (or a group of corporations treated as a single employer) with significant book-to-tax differences and a three-year average annual income over $1 billion from the prior three tax years.\n  * A company needs to pass the book income test only once to be subject to AMT. Unless the IRS specifies otherwise, it remains an applicable corporation.\n  * The new corporate AMT applies a 15% tax to a company\u2019s \u301069\u2020adjusted financial statement income\u2020irc.bloombergtax.com\u3011 (AFSI). AFSI is a company\u2019s net income or loss reported on it\u2019s applicable financial statements (AFS), such as a Form 10-K filed with the SEC, including tax and accounting adjustments. Accelerated depreciation is a tax adjustment (but not for book purposes).\n  * This aspect of the corporate AMT could substantially cut the minimum tax bill of corporations that invest heavily in the next few years. However, it will have less impact as bonus depreciation phases out unless Congress decides to extend it.\n  * The IRA either created or reinstated green energy \u301070\u2020tax credits\u3011. Combined with the AMT, these credits will affect corporations\u2019 decisions about bonus depreciation.\n\n### Bonus or no bonus\n\nDepreciation can factor into both regular and AMT tax calculations for corporations.\n\nSay a corporation wants to claim the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) before it expires at the end of 2024. However, the company must have tax liability in order to take advantage of t",

They reduce a fixed cost, impart your environmental values to your community, and they can help you save big on taxes.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019re focusing on the tax benefits you can take advantage of by installing solar for your business.\n\n## What Tax Benefits Are Available For Commercial Solar Panels?\n\nThere are two main ways solar energy saves businesses money on tax day:\n\n  * the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), and\n  * accelerated depreciation\u00a0\n\nEach works differently, but both keep more money in your bank account.\n\n## How Does The Federal Tax Credit Work for Commercial Solar?\n\nThe \u301018\u2020Solar Investment Tax Credit\u3011 (ITC) saves businesses a substantial amount on solar installation costs through a tax credit granted by the US Federal Government. Qualifying companies can recoup 30% or more of their solar investment.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work.  \n\nSolar Systems Under 1 MW AC Power\n\nSystems under 1 megawatt (MW) AC power will receive a tax credit of at least 30% of installation costs. For most businesses, this is the guaranteed rate until 2025.\u00a0\n\nYou could qualify for one or more adders, which increase the 30% credit.\n\n  * Energy communities (+10%): This aims to encourage the adoption of solar on some brownfield sites and in some communities with fossil-fuel-focused economies. \u301019\u2020Use this map \u2020arcgis.netl.doe.gov\u3011to see where they are.\u00a0\n  * Domestic content (+10%): To bolster American-made solar components, using domestic materials and equipment can save you more. However, it\u2019s hard to find products that will qualify.\u00a0\n  * Low-income areas (+10%): Businesses in areas that meet low-income qualifications can receive an additional 10% of the tax credit.\u00a0\n\nSolar Systems 1 - 5 MW AC Power\n\nSystems 1 to 5 MW AC power will receive the full 30% tax credit as of the writing of this blog. However, once the IRS issues additional guidelines, things change.\n\nOnce in effect, the tax credit for these larger systems will start at 6%. If the project meets certain conditions, the tax credit can increase to 70%. These include:\n\n  * Prevailing wage (+24%): You can gain the 30% credit if the project meets apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements.  \nEnergy communities (10%): Same as above\n  * Domestic content (10%): Same as above\n  * Low-income area (10%): Same as above\n\nLarger systems have a second option. Instead of the ITC, you can choose a \u301020\u2020production tax credit (PTC)\u2020www.solarpowerworldonline.com\u3011. With this, you\u2019ll earn credit for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity your system produces. The current rate is $0.026/kWh, but it\u2019ll increase with inflation.\n\n## When Can Businesses Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\n[Image 3: IRA Solar Tax Credit Commercial Carry Forward Rule]You don\u2019t have to use the credit for the year you installed your system. There\u2019s a 25-year window for when you can use your ITC.\n\nBusinesses can apply the credit to taxes they owe for any year from three years before the installation and up to 22 years after the installation.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you installed a system in 2024, you could apply your credit to taxes owed between the years 2021 to 2046.\n\n## Does A Business Need To Owe Taxes To Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\nThe ITC has existed for a long time, but it changed in the 2020s. Before, businesses had to owe federal taxes to qualify for the credit. However, in 2022, the introduction of a transferability program changed this.\n\nIt\u2019s now possible for businesses to \u201ctransfer\u201d (or sell) their solar tax credit to a third party with tax liability.\u00a0\n\nBecause this is a relatively new incentive, support for these transactions is still developing. We expect to see firms and professionals specializing in brokering and administering these transfers very soon.\u00a0\n\nThat said, we do have some guidance on how it\u2019ll work:\n\n  * The owner of the system must register with the IRS to obtain a registration number.\n  * The tax credit can be transferred to multiple parties (e.g., one business purchases 40% and another purchases 60%).\n  * The credit can only be transferred once.\n  * It must be a cash transaction.\n  * You can\u2019t transfer the credit to a related party (e.g., business partner, family member, etc.)\n  * If the system owner sells the system within the first six years, the transferee is responsible for any tax liability triggered by the solar system\u2019s ownership change.\n\nWhile some unknowns exist, this program makes solar more viable for even more businesses and nonprofits.\n\n[Image 4: New call-to-action]\n\n## The Other Tax Incentive For Commercial Solar: Accelerated Depreciation\n\nLike machinery, equipment, and buildings, your solar panel system will depreciate. And you can reap the benefits of this on your taxes.\n\nCommercial solar panel systems qualify for \u301021\u2020accelerated bonus depreciation\u3011, which applies to federal depreciation only.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for 2024:\n\n  * Year 1: You can take 60% of the solar system\u2019s entire federal depreciation.\n  * Years 2 - 6: The remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule.\u00a0\n\nState-level depreciation benefits will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n### How Much Money Can You Save with Accelerated Depreciation on Commercial Solar?\n\nThe savings from depreciation will depend on the cost of your system and your federal and state tax brackets. That said, it can cover a significant portion of the installation cost.\n\nIn one example, for a $300,000 system, a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax rate saved 26.3% of the system\u2019s entire cost ($79,050).\u00a0\n\nDetermining the Basis of Depreciation with the Solar Federal Tax Credit\n\nThe federal investment tax credit can reduce the cost of going solar by 30% or more. But is the cost basis for the depreciation of your solar system calculated before or after the ITC?\n\nThe IRS splits the difference with you. That means if your tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% x .5]). So if your system costs $100,000 to install, you\u2019d depreciate on $85,000.\n\nIf you opt for the production tax credit (PTC) over the ITC, your depreciable basis will not be reduced. You can depreciate the full 100% of the system\u2019s cost \u2014 not just 85%. However, the PTC typically only makes sense for very large, utility-scale systems.\n\nThe Future of Accelerated Depreciation Benefits for Commercial Solar Panels\n\nAccelerated deprecation is slowly being phased out. Beyond 2024, the 60% first-year bonus will drop each year in increments of 20%. In 2025, you\u2019ll be able to take 40%. In 2026, it\u2019ll be 20%, and in 2027, it\u2019ll be 0%.\n\nThe amount you\u2019ll receive for depreciation won\u2019t change as it\u2019s phased out, but the time at which you receive it will. In 2027, all depreciation on the system will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\n\n## How Will Solar Impact Your Business's Taxes?\n\nBetween the ITC\u2019s 30%+ savings and accelerated bonus depreciation, installing solar can instantly add savings to your business\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWant to know how much going solar can save your business?

            "The solar accelerated depreciation schedule is indeed changing. Previously, businesses could depreciate 100% of the cost basis in the first year for property acquired after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. However, starting from 2023, this benefit began to decrease by 20% each year, reaching 60% in 2024. This trend will continue, dropping to 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and eventually phasing out to 0% by 2027. Despite this step-down, businesses can still depreciate the full cost basis, but the amount exceeding the first-year accelerated depreciation will follow the five-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) schedule\u30105\u2020source\u3011\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law on August 16, 2022, did not directly impact the bonus depreciation but did introduce changes that will affect accelerated depreciation deductions for large corporations through the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). The bonus depreciation percentage allowed for businesses to write off qualified equipment costs in the year it is placed into service is scheduled to decrease annually, aligning with the phase-out of the accelerated depreciation schedule\u30106\u2020source\u3011.\n\nCommercial solar installations benefit significantly from these tax incentives, including the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC) and accelerated depreciation. For example, in 2024, businesses can take advantage of 60% bonus depreciation in the first year at the federal level for commercial solar systems, with the remaining balance following the five-year MACRS schedule. State-level depreciation benefits will also follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule. This schedule facilitates substantial tax savings and promotes shorter payback periods and higher returns on investment for businesses investing in solar energy\u30107\u2020source\u3011."

It's one of the easiest ways businesses and farms can keep \u301018\u2020installation costs\u3011 down, ROIs high, and paybacks short.\u00a0\n\nPut simply, depreciation is a decline in an asset\u2019s value over time. Your business can use this to recover costs from purchases as the equipment\u2019s value degrades throughout its lifetime. \n\nThere are a few different ways to expense depreciation, but we\u2019re going to focus on depreciating your solar system using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS depreciation, with a portion of the federal benefits accelerated to year one.\n\nAt Paradise Energy, we are expert solar installation professionals, not accountants. We give the most accurate outlook we can based on the financial information provided to us by our customers, but before making any decisions on how to expense depreciation, we recommend checking with your accountant first. \n\nA word to homeowners looking to go solar: depreciation is not generally allowed on residences unless it is considered a business expense.\n\n## Accelerated Bonus Depreciation for Commercial Solar Installations\n\n### What is the Depreciation Rate for a Commercial Solar System?\u00a0\n\nAs a business leader, you understand the importance of making strategic investments that yield both financial returns and environmental benefits. The type of investment you choose plays a significant role in the equation of determining the recovery period of your investment.  \n\nA commercial solar investment has the benefit of offering 60% bonus depreciation in year one on the federal level. The remaining balance will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule. On the state level, the depreciation will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0  \n\nCompared to many other business investments, solar energy provides a great tool for businesses to offset a significant portion of their tax liability in a relatively short period while also controlling a fixed cost.\u00a0\n\n### Is Solar Depreciation Calculated Before or After the Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)?\n\nBecause everything has a wonderful way of being simple and easy, the answer to this question is going to be either before or after, right? Not so much. The IRS reduces the basis for depreciation by one-half of the tax credit amount allowed. So since the tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% X .5]). For example, if your solar system costs $100,000, you would be able to depreciate $85,000 of the system cost.\u00a0\n\nNote: For property acquired after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023, the law allowed taxpayers to take a deduction amounting to 100%. That dropped to 80% in 2023 and will continue to step down by 20% each year until it reaches 0% in 2027.\n\n### Does the Production Tax Credit Impact Your Depreciable Basis?\n\nThe \u301019\u2020Production Tax Credit \u2020youtu.be\u3011(PTC) is an alternative to the 30% Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Instead of a lump sum 30% tax credit, the PTC pays a set amount per kWh over a ten-year span. Using the PTC typically makes the most sense for utility-scale solar systems.\n\nUnlike the ITC, claiming\u00a0the Production\u00a0Tax Credit does not reduce\u00a0your depreciable basis.\u00a0\n\n### Federal Depreciation vs State Depreciation For Commercial Solar\n\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act changed how we can depreciate solar on the federal level. Prior to 2023, businesses could depreciate 100% of the cost basis in the first year. Since then the accelerated depreciation base has decreased by 20% a year, leaving it at 60% in 2024. This will continue to decrease by 20% a year until it reaches 0% in 2027.\n\nBusinesses can still depreciate 100% of the cost basis, but the remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n[Image 3: Hear from an accountant that invested in solar.]\n\n## An Example of How Commercial Solar Depreciation Works\n\nLet\u2019s figure out the MACRS depreciation for a \u301020\u2020solar panel system that costs $300,000\u3011 before incentives. You\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the \u301021\u2020Federal Solar Incentive Tax Credit \u3011at 30%. But since we have to calculate depreciation with half of the tax credit, reducing the depreciable cost basis, we\u2019ll have to take 15% off the cost of the system to get the basis of depreciation. We can do this by multiplying the cost by 85%, which gives us $255,000.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to know your federal and state tax brackets. We\u2019ll use a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax for this example.\n\nTo calculate federal tax savings from depreciation, multiply the $255,000 by 24%. Because you can take advantage of 60% of this in the first year, you\u2019ll enjoy $36,720 in savings that will offset your tax liability the year that your solar system is placed into service. The remaining $24,480 of the depreciable amount will follow the MACRS schedule.\n\nTo get state savings, multiply $255,000 by your state tax rate, which in this case is 7%. You\u2019ll get $17,850 spread over the 5-year MACRS schedule.\n\nThat means the total savings from just depreciation would be $79,050. In this example, that\u2019s 26.3% of the entire solar system\u2019s cost! \u00a0\n\nRecovery Year Federal Depreciation State Depreciation Total Savings  \nYear 1 60% Federal 20% State $40,290  \nYear 2 20% of the remaining 40% 32% State $10,608  \nYear 3 32% of the remaining 40% 19.2% State $11,261  \nYear 4 19.2% of the remaining 40% 11.5% State $6,753  \nYear 5 11.5% of the remaining 40% 11.5% State $4,868  \nYear 6 11.5% of the remaining 40% 5.76% State $3,843  \nYear 7 5.76% of the remaining 40% 0% State $1,410  \n\nThese tax savings will keep your \u301022\u2020payback period short and your ROI high\u3011. You\u2019ll be able to use these savings to reduce a loan\u2019s principal owed or reinvest in your company.\n\nAre you ready to see how much you could save with solar? \u30107\u2020Use our Solar Savings Calculator\u3011 to get an instant price and savings estimate.\u00a0\n\n[Image 4: Use our solar savings calculator]\n\nLast Updated: December 22, 2023\n\n##  Related Blogs\n\n\u301023\u2020Solar for Businesses\u3011 |  10 min read \n\n## \u301017\u2020Commercial Solar 101: A Business' Guide To Investing In Solar Panels\u3011\n\nIf you're a business leader who's ready to control a fixed cost, pay fewer taxes, and be on your way to saving more of your hard-earned\n\n\u301024\u2020Andy Schell\u3011    \n\n\u301025\u2020Solar Equipment\u3011 |  4 min read \n\n## \u301026\u2020What Are The Different Types of Commercial Solar Installations?\u3011\n\nMany businesses' goals for going solar are the same: generate their own cost- and emissions-free electricity.

They reduce a fixed cost, impart your environmental values to your community, and they can help you save big on taxes.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019re focusing on the tax benefits you can take advantage of by installing solar for your business.\n\n## What Tax Benefits Are Available For Commercial Solar Panels?\n\nThere are two main ways solar energy saves businesses money on tax day:\n\n  * the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), and\n  * accelerated depreciation\u00a0\n\nEach works differently, but both keep more money in your bank account.\n\n## How Does The Federal Tax Credit Work for Commercial Solar?\n\nThe \u301018\u2020Solar Investment Tax Credit\u3011 (ITC) saves businesses a substantial amount on solar installation costs through a tax credit granted by the US Federal Government. Qualifying companies can recoup 30% or more of their solar investment.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work.  \n\nSolar Systems Under 1 MW AC Power\n\nSystems under 1 megawatt (MW) AC power will receive a tax credit of at least 30% of installation costs. For most businesses, this is the guaranteed rate until 2025.\u00a0\n\nYou could qualify for one or more adders, which increase the 30% credit.\n\n  * Energy communities (+10%): This aims to encourage the adoption of solar on some brownfield sites and in some communities with fossil-fuel-focused economies. \u301019\u2020Use this map \u2020arcgis.netl.doe.gov\u3011to see where they are.\u00a0\n  * Domestic content (+10%): To bolster American-made solar components, using domestic materials and equipment can save you more. However, it\u2019s hard to find products that will qualify.\u00a0\n  * Low-income areas (+10%): Businesses in areas that meet low-income qualifications can receive an additional 10% of the tax credit.\u00a0\n\nSolar Systems 1 - 5 MW AC Power\n\nSystems 1 to 5 MW AC power will receive the full 30% tax credit as of the writing of this blog. However, once the IRS issues additional guidelines, things change.\n\nOnce in effect, the tax credit for these larger systems will start at 6%. If the project meets certain conditions, the tax credit can increase to 70%. These include:\n\n  * Prevailing wage (+24%): You can gain the 30% credit if the project meets apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements.  \nEnergy communities (10%): Same as above\n  * Domestic content (10%): Same as above\n  * Low-income area (10%): Same as above\n\nLarger systems have a second option. Instead of the ITC, you can choose a \u301020\u2020production tax credit (PTC)\u2020www.solarpowerworldonline.com\u3011. With this, you\u2019ll earn credit for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity your system produces. The current rate is $0.026/kWh, but it\u2019ll increase with inflation.\n\n## When Can Businesses Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\n[Image 3: IRA Solar Tax Credit Commercial Carry Forward Rule]You don\u2019t have to use the credit for the year you installed your system. There\u2019s a 25-year window for when you can use your ITC.\n\nBusinesses can apply the credit to taxes they owe for any year from three years before the installation and up to 22 years after the installation.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you installed a system in 2024, you could apply your credit to taxes owed between the years 2021 to 2046.\n\n## Does A Business Need To Owe Taxes To Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\nThe ITC has existed for a long time, but it changed in the 2020s. Before, businesses had to owe federal taxes to qualify for the credit. However, in 2022, the introduction of a transferability program changed this.\n\nIt\u2019s now possible for businesses to \u201ctransfer\u201d (or sell) their solar tax credit to a third party with tax liability.\u00a0\n\nBecause this is a relatively new incentive, support for these transactions is still developing. We expect to see firms and professionals specializing in brokering and administering these transfers very soon.\u00a0\n\nThat said, we do have some guidance on how it\u2019ll work:\n\n  * The owner of the system must register with the IRS to obtain a registration number.\n  * The tax credit can be transferred to multiple parties (e.g., one business purchases 40% and another purchases 60%).\n  * The credit can only be transferred once.\n  * It must be a cash transaction.\n  * You can\u2019t transfer the credit to a related party (e.g., business partner, family member, etc.)\n  * If the system owner sells the system within the first six years, the transferee is responsible for any tax liability triggered by the solar system\u2019s ownership change.\n\nWhile some unknowns exist, this program makes solar more viable for even more businesses and nonprofits.\n\n[Image 4: New call-to-action]\n\n## The Other Tax Incentive For Commercial Solar: Accelerated Depreciation\n\nLike machinery, equipment, and buildings, your solar panel system will depreciate. And you can reap the benefits of this on your taxes.\n\nCommercial solar panel systems qualify for \u301021\u2020accelerated bonus depreciation\u3011, which applies to federal depreciation only.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for 2024:\n\n  * Year 1: You can take 60% of the solar system\u2019s entire federal depreciation.\n  * Years 2 - 6: The remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule.\u00a0\n\nState-level depreciation benefits will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n### How Much Money Can You Save with Accelerated Depreciation on Commercial Solar?\n\nThe savings from depreciation will depend on the cost of your system and your federal and state tax brackets. That said, it can cover a significant portion of the installation cost.\n\nIn one example, for a $300,000 system, a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax rate saved 26.3% of the system\u2019s entire cost ($79,050).\u00a0\n\nDetermining the Basis of Depreciation with the Solar Federal Tax Credit\n\nThe federal investment tax credit can reduce the cost of going solar by 30% or more. But is the cost basis for the depreciation of your solar system calculated before or after the ITC?\n\nThe IRS splits the difference with you. That means if your tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% x .5]). So if your system costs $100,000 to install, you\u2019d depreciate on $85,000.\n\nIf you opt for the production tax credit (PTC) over the ITC, your depreciable basis will not be reduced. You can depreciate the full 100% of the system\u2019s cost \u2014 not just 85%. However, the PTC typically only makes sense for very large, utility-scale systems.\n\nThe Future of Accelerated Depreciation Benefits for Commercial Solar Panels\n\nAccelerated deprecation is slowly being phased out. Beyond 2024, the 60% first-year bonus will drop each year in increments of 20%. In 2025, you\u2019ll be able to take 40%. In 2026, it\u2019ll be 20%, and in 2027, it\u2019ll be 0%.\n\nThe amount you\u2019ll receive for depreciation won\u2019t change as it\u2019s phased out, but the time at which you receive it will. In 2027, all depreciation on the system will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\n\n## How Will Solar Impact Your Business's Taxes?\n\nBetween the ITC\u2019s 30%+ savings and accelerated bonus depreciation, installing solar can instantly add savings to your business\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWant to know how much going solar can save your business?

assets.\n\nPresident Biden signed the \u301068\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u3011 (IRA) into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA aims to limit inflation by reducing the deficit, investing in domestic energy production, and rewarding renewable energy. This article discusses how this landmark law impacts bonus depreciation and the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).\n\nTax professionals should be aware of these changes as they advise clients on capital investment and equipment purchases.\n\n## Three things to know about the new corporate AMT\n\n###### Bloomberg Tax Law Analyst Morgan Oliver, J.D., breaks down special rules for determining which corporations are subject to the CAMT, such as aggregating the income of all members in a closely related business group and employing an eligibility test for members of a foreign-parented multinational group.\n\n## Accelerated bonus depreciation\n\nAccelerated depreciation allows businesses to write off most property costs \u2013 vehicles, equipment, etc. \u2013 faster than under modified accelerated cost recovery (MACRS). The idea is that businesses can recoup part of these costs more quickly, allowing them to make capital investments that boost the economy while freeing up cash flow for other requirements.\n\nThe tax code has different methods of accelerated depreciation. One popular method is bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation lets businesses write off a portion of an asset\u2019s cost in its first year of use. A company can currently write off 100% of qualified equipment costs in the year it placed its service. This percentage is scheduled to drop to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, and 40% in 2025, until its wholly phased out in 2027.  \n\nThe IRA did not directly impact bonus depreciation. But it will impact accelerated depreciation deductions of large corporations via another aspect of the legislation: corporate AMT.\n\n### Corporate alternative minimum tax 2022\n\nCongress introduced the corporate AMT in 1986 to prevent large companies from using tax exemptions to avoid paying income taxes, despite high earnings. Corporate AMT was eventually repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nThe old version of the corporate AMT required companies to calculate their tax liability twice: once using the regular tax code and once using an alternative calculation without certain deductions. Then, the company paid whichever resulted in the highest tax bill.\n\nThe IRA of 2022 reintroduced the corporate AMT, but with major changes:\n\n  * It applies only to certain corporations (or a group of corporations treated as a single employer) with significant book-to-tax differences and a three-year average annual income over $1 billion from the prior three tax years.\n  * A company needs to pass the book income test only once to be subject to AMT. Unless the IRS specifies otherwise, it remains an applicable corporation.\n  * The new corporate AMT applies a 15% tax to a company\u2019s \u301069\u2020adjusted financial statement income\u2020irc.bloombergtax.com\u3011 (AFSI). AFSI is a company\u2019s net income or loss reported on it\u2019s applicable financial statements (AFS), such as a Form 10-K filed with the SEC, including tax and accounting adjustments. Accelerated depreciation is a tax adjustment (but not for book purposes).\n  * This aspect of the corporate AMT could substantially cut the minimum tax bill of corporations that invest heavily in the next few years. However, it will have less impact as bonus depreciation phases out unless Congress decides to extend it.\n  * The IRA either created or reinstated green energy \u301070\u2020tax credits\u3011. Combined with the AMT, these credits will affect corporations\u2019 decisions about bonus depreciation.\n\n### Bonus or no bonus\n\nDepreciation can factor into both regular and AMT tax calculations for corporations.\n\nSay a corporation wants to claim the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) before it expires at the end of 2024. However, the company must have tax liability in order to take advantage of t",

They reduce a fixed cost, impart your environmental values to your community, and they can help you save big on taxes.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019re focusing on the tax benefits you can take advantage of by installing solar for your business.\n\n## What Tax Benefits Are Available For Commercial Solar Panels?\n\nThere are two main ways solar energy saves businesses money on tax day:\n\n  * the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), and\n  * accelerated depreciation\u00a0\n\nEach works differently, but both keep more money in your bank account.\n\n## How Does The Federal Tax Credit Work for Commercial Solar?\n\nThe \u301018\u2020Solar Investment Tax Credit\u3011 (ITC) saves businesses a substantial amount on solar installation costs through a tax credit granted by the US Federal Government. Qualifying companies can recoup 30% or more of their solar investment.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work.  \n\nSolar Systems Under 1 MW AC Power\n\nSystems under 1 megawatt (MW) AC power will receive a tax credit of at least 30% of installation costs. For most businesses, this is the guaranteed rate until 2025.\u00a0\n\nYou could qualify for one or more adders, which increase the 30% credit.\n\n  * Energy communities (+10%): This aims to encourage the adoption of solar on some brownfield sites and in some communities with fossil-fuel-focused economies. \u301019\u2020Use this map \u2020arcgis.netl.doe.gov\u3011to see where they are.\u00a0\n  * Domestic content (+10%): To bolster American-made solar components, using domestic materials and equipment can save you more. However, it\u2019s hard to find products that will qualify.\u00a0\n  * Low-income areas (+10%): Businesses in areas that meet low-income qualifications can receive an additional 10% of the tax credit.\u00a0\n\nSolar Systems 1 - 5 MW AC Power\n\nSystems 1 to 5 MW AC power will receive the full 30% tax credit as of the writing of this blog. However, once the IRS issues additional guidelines, things change.\n\nOnce in effect, the tax credit for these larger systems will start at 6%. If the project meets certain conditions, the tax credit can increase to 70%. These include:\n\n  * Prevailing wage (+24%): You can gain the 30% credit if the project meets apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements.  \nEnergy communities (10%): Same as above\n  * Domestic content (10%): Same as above\n  * Low-income area (10%): Same as above\n\nLarger systems have a second option. Instead of the ITC, you can choose a \u301020\u2020production tax credit (PTC)\u2020www.solarpowerworldonline.com\u3011. With this, you\u2019ll earn credit for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity your system produces. The current rate is $0.026/kWh, but it\u2019ll increase with inflation.\n\n## When Can Businesses Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\n[Image 3: IRA Solar Tax Credit Commercial Carry Forward Rule]You don\u2019t have to use the credit for the year you installed your system. There\u2019s a 25-year window for when you can use your ITC.\n\nBusinesses can apply the credit to taxes they owe for any year from three years before the installation and up to 22 years after the installation.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you installed a system in 2024, you could apply your credit to taxes owed between the years 2021 to 2046.\n\n## Does A Business Need To Owe Taxes To Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\nThe ITC has existed for a long time, but it changed in the 2020s. Before, businesses had to owe federal taxes to qualify for the credit. However, in 2022, the introduction of a transferability program changed this.\n\nIt\u2019s now possible for businesses to \u201ctransfer\u201d (or sell) their solar tax credit to a third party with tax liability.\u00a0\n\nBecause this is a relatively new incentive, support for these transactions is still developing. We expect to see firms and professionals specializing in brokering and administering these transfers very soon.\u00a0\n\nThat said, we do have some guidance on how it\u2019ll work:\n\n  * The owner of the system must register with the IRS to obtain a registration number.\n  * The tax credit can be transferred to multiple parties (e.g., one business purchases 40% and another purchases 60%).\n  * The credit can only be transferred once.\n  * It must be a cash transaction.\n  * You can\u2019t transfer the credit to a related party (e.g., business partner, family member, etc.)\n  * If the system owner sells the system within the first six years, the transferee is responsible for any tax liability triggered by the solar system\u2019s ownership change.\n\nWhile some unknowns exist, this program makes solar more viable for even more businesses and nonprofits.\n\n[Image 4: New call-to-action]\n\n## The Other Tax Incentive For Commercial Solar: Accelerated Depreciation\n\nLike machinery, equipment, and buildings, your solar panel system will depreciate. And you can reap the benefits of this on your taxes.\n\nCommercial solar panel systems qualify for \u301021\u2020accelerated bonus depreciation\u3011, which applies to federal depreciation only.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for 2024:\n\n  * Year 1: You can take 60% of the solar system\u2019s entire federal depreciation.\n  * Years 2 - 6: The remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule.\u00a0\n\nState-level depreciation benefits will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n### How Much Money Can You Save with Accelerated Depreciation on Commercial Solar?\n\nThe savings from depreciation will depend on the cost of your system and your federal and state tax brackets. That said, it can cover a significant portion of the installation cost.\n\nIn one example, for a $300,000 system, a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax rate saved 26.3% of the system\u2019s entire cost ($79,050).\u00a0\n\nDetermining the Basis of Depreciation with the Solar Federal Tax Credit\n\nThe federal investment tax credit can reduce the cost of going solar by 30% or more. But is the cost basis for the depreciation of your solar system calculated before or after the ITC?\n\nThe IRS splits the difference with you. That means if your tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% x .5]). So if your system costs $100,000 to install, you\u2019d depreciate on $85,000.\n\nIf you opt for the production tax credit (PTC) over the ITC, your depreciable basis will not be reduced. You can depreciate the full 100% of the system\u2019s cost \u2014 not just 85%. However, the PTC typically only makes sense for very large, utility-scale systems.\n\nThe Future of Accelerated Depreciation Benefits for Commercial Solar Panels\n\nAccelerated deprecation is slowly being phased out. Beyond 2024, the 60% first-year bonus will drop each year in increments of 20%. In 2025, you\u2019ll be able to take 40%. In 2026, it\u2019ll be 20%, and in 2027, it\u2019ll be 0%.\n\nThe amount you\u2019ll receive for depreciation won\u2019t change as it\u2019s phased out, but the time at which you receive it will. In 2027, all depreciation on the system will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\n\n## How Will Solar Impact Your Business's Taxes?\n\nBetween the ITC\u2019s 30%+ savings and accelerated bonus depreciation, installing solar can instantly add savings to your business\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWant to know how much going solar can save your business?

It's one of the easiest ways businesses and farms can keep \u301018\u2020installation costs\u3011 down, ROIs high, and paybacks short.\u00a0\n\nPut simply, depreciation is a decline in an asset\u2019s value over time. Your business can use this to recover costs from purchases as the equipment\u2019s value degrades throughout its lifetime. \n\nThere are a few different ways to expense depreciation, but we\u2019re going to focus on depreciating your solar system using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS depreciation, with a portion of the federal benefits accelerated to year one.\n\nAt Paradise Energy, we are expert solar installation professionals, not accountants. We give the most accurate outlook we can based on the financial information provided to us by our customers, but before making any decisions on how to expense depreciation, we recommend checking with your accountant first. \n\nA word to homeowners looking to go solar: depreciation is not generally allowed on residences unless it is considered a business expense.\n\n## Accelerated Bonus Depreciation for Commercial Solar Installations\n\n### What is the Depreciation Rate for a Commercial Solar System?\u00a0\n\nAs a business leader, you understand the importance of making strategic investments that yield both financial returns and environmental benefits. The type of investment you choose plays a significant role in the equation of determining the recovery period of your investment.  \n\nA commercial solar investment has the benefit of offering 60% bonus depreciation in year one on the federal level. The remaining balance will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule. On the state level, the depreciation will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0  \n\nCompared to many other business investments, solar energy provides a great tool for businesses to offset a significant portion of their tax liability in a relatively short period while also controlling a fixed cost.\u00a0\n\n### Is Solar Depreciation Calculated Before or After the Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)?\n\nBecause everything has a wonderful way of being simple and easy, the answer to this question is going to be either before or after, right? Not so much. The IRS reduces the basis for depreciation by one-half of the tax credit amount allowed. So since the tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% X .5]). For example, if your solar system costs $100,000, you would be able to depreciate $85,000 of the system cost.\u00a0\n\nNote: For property acquired after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023, the law allowed taxpayers to take a deduction amounting to 100%. That dropped to 80% in 2023 and will continue to step down by 20% each year until it reaches 0% in 2027.\n\n### Does the Production Tax Credit Impact Your Depreciable Basis?\n\nThe \u301019\u2020Production Tax Credit \u2020youtu.be\u3011(PTC) is an alternative to the 30% Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Instead of a lump sum 30% tax credit, the PTC pays a set amount per kWh over a ten-year span. Using the PTC typically makes the most sense for utility-scale solar systems.\n\nUnlike the ITC, claiming\u00a0the Production\u00a0Tax Credit does not reduce\u00a0your depreciable basis.\u00a0\n\n### Federal Depreciation vs State Depreciation For Commercial Solar\n\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act changed how we can depreciate solar on the federal level. Prior to 2023, businesses could depreciate 100% of the cost basis in the first year. Since then the accelerated depreciation base has decreased by 20% a year, leaving it at 60% in 2024. This will continue to decrease by 20% a year until it reaches 0% in 2027.\n\nBusinesses can still depreciate 100% of the cost basis, but the remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n[Image 3: Hear from an accountant that invested in solar.]\n\n## An Example of How Commercial Solar Depreciation Works\n\nLet\u2019s figure out the MACRS depreciation for a \u301020\u2020solar panel system that costs $300,000\u3011 before incentives. You\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the \u301021\u2020Federal Solar Incentive Tax Credit \u3011at 30%. But since we have to calculate depreciation with half of the tax credit, reducing the depreciable cost basis, we\u2019ll have to take 15% off the cost of the system to get the basis of depreciation. We can do this by multiplying the cost by 85%, which gives us $255,000.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to know your federal and state tax brackets. We\u2019ll use a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax for this example.\n\nTo calculate federal tax savings from depreciation, multiply the $255,000 by 24%. Because you can take advantage of 60% of this in the first year, you\u2019ll enjoy $36,720 in savings that will offset your tax liability the year that your solar system is placed into service. The remaining $24,480 of the depreciable amount will follow the MACRS schedule.\n\nTo get state savings, multiply $255,000 by your state tax rate, which in this case is 7%. You\u2019ll get $17,850 spread over the 5-year MACRS schedule.\n\nThat means the total savings from just depreciation would be $79,050. In this example, that\u2019s 26.3% of the entire solar system\u2019s cost! \u00a0\n\nRecovery Year Federal Depreciation State Depreciation Total Savings  \nYear 1 60% Federal 20% State $40,290  \nYear 2 20% of the remaining 40% 32% State $10,608  \nYear 3 32% of the remaining 40% 19.2% State $11,261  \nYear 4 19.2% of the remaining 40% 11.5% State $6,753  \nYear 5 11.5% of the remaining 40% 11.5% State $4,868  \nYear 6 11.5% of the remaining 40% 5.76% State $3,843  \nYear 7 5.76% of the remaining 40% 0% State $1,410  \n\nThese tax savings will keep your \u301022\u2020payback period short and your ROI high\u3011. You\u2019ll be able to use these savings to reduce a loan\u2019s principal owed or reinvest in your company.\n\nAre you ready to see how much you could save with solar? \u30107\u2020Use our Solar Savings Calculator\u3011 to get an instant price and savings estimate.\u00a0\n\n[Image 4: Use our solar savings calculator]\n\nLast Updated: December 22, 2023\n\n##  Related Blogs\n\n\u301023\u2020Solar for Businesses\u3011 |  10 min read \n\n## \u301017\u2020Commercial Solar 101: A Business' Guide To Investing In Solar Panels\u3011\n\nIf you're a business leader who's ready to control a fixed cost, pay fewer taxes, and be on your way to saving more of your hard-earned\n\n\u301024\u2020Andy Schell\u3011    \n\n\u301025\u2020Solar Equipment\u3011 |  4 min read \n\n## \u301026\u2020What Are The Different Types of Commercial Solar Installations?\u3011\n\nMany businesses' goals for going solar are the same: generate their own cost- and emissions-free electricity.

They reduce a fixed cost, impart your environmental values to your community, and they can help you save big on taxes.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019re focusing on the tax benefits you can take advantage of by installing solar for your business.\n\n## What Tax Benefits Are Available For Commercial Solar Panels?\n\nThere are two main ways solar energy saves businesses money on tax day:\n\n  * the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), and\n  * accelerated depreciation\u00a0\n\nEach works differently, but both keep more money in your bank account.\n\n## How Does The Federal Tax Credit Work for Commercial Solar?\n\nThe \u301018\u2020Solar Investment Tax Credit\u3011 (ITC) saves businesses a substantial amount on solar installation costs through a tax credit granted by the US Federal Government. Qualifying companies can recoup 30% or more of their solar investment.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work.  \n\nSolar Systems Under 1 MW AC Power\n\nSystems under 1 megawatt (MW) AC power will receive a tax credit of at least 30% of installation costs. For most businesses, this is the guaranteed rate until 2025.\u00a0\n\nYou could qualify for one or more adders, which increase the 30% credit.\n\n  * Energy communities (+10%): This aims to encourage the adoption of solar on some brownfield sites and in some communities with fossil-fuel-focused economies. \u301019\u2020Use this map \u2020arcgis.netl.doe.gov\u3011to see where they are.\u00a0\n  * Domestic content (+10%): To bolster American-made solar components, using domestic materials and equipment can save you more. However, it\u2019s hard to find products that will qualify.\u00a0\n  * Low-income areas (+10%): Businesses in areas that meet low-income qualifications can receive an additional 10% of the tax credit.\u00a0\n\nSolar Systems 1 - 5 MW AC Power\n\nSystems 1 to 5 MW AC power will receive the full 30% tax credit as of the writing of this blog. However, once the IRS issues additional guidelines, things change.\n\nOnce in effect, the tax credit for these larger systems will start at 6%. If the project meets certain conditions, the tax credit can increase to 70%. These include:\n\n  * Prevailing wage (+24%): You can gain the 30% credit if the project meets apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements.  \nEnergy communities (10%): Same as above\n  * Domestic content (10%): Same as above\n  * Low-income area (10%): Same as above\n\nLarger systems have a second option. Instead of the ITC, you can choose a \u301020\u2020production tax credit (PTC)\u2020www.solarpowerworldonline.com\u3011. With this, you\u2019ll earn credit for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity your system produces. The current rate is $0.026/kWh, but it\u2019ll increase with inflation.\n\n## When Can Businesses Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\n[Image 3: IRA Solar Tax Credit Commercial Carry Forward Rule]You don\u2019t have to use the credit for the year you installed your system. There\u2019s a 25-year window for when you can use your ITC.\n\nBusinesses can apply the credit to taxes they owe for any year from three years before the installation and up to 22 years after the installation.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you installed a system in 2024, you could apply your credit to taxes owed between the years 2021 to 2046.\n\n## Does A Business Need To Owe Taxes To Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\nThe ITC has existed for a long time, but it changed in the 2020s. Before, businesses had to owe federal taxes to qualify for the credit. However, in 2022, the introduction of a transferability program changed this.\n\nIt\u2019s now possible for businesses to \u201ctransfer\u201d (or sell) their solar tax credit to a third party with tax liability.\u00a0\n\nBecause this is a relatively new incentive, support for these transactions is still developing. We expect to see firms and professionals specializing in brokering and administering these transfers very soon.\u00a0\n\nThat said, we do have some guidance on how it\u2019ll work:\n\n  * The owner of the system must register with the IRS to obtain a registration number.\n  * The tax credit can be transferred to multiple parties (e.g., one business purchases 40% and another purchases 60%).\n  * The credit can only be transferred once.\n  * It must be a cash transaction.\n  * You can\u2019t transfer the credit to a related party (e.g., business partner, family member, etc.)\n  * If the system owner sells the system within the first six years, the transferee is responsible for any tax liability triggered by the solar system\u2019s ownership change.\n\nWhile some unknowns exist, this program makes solar more viable for even more businesses and nonprofits.\n\n[Image 4: New call-to-action]\n\n## The Other Tax Incentive For Commercial Solar: Accelerated Depreciation\n\nLike machinery, equipment, and buildings, your solar panel system will depreciate. And you can reap the benefits of this on your taxes.\n\nCommercial solar panel systems qualify for \u301021\u2020accelerated bonus depreciation\u3011, which applies to federal depreciation only.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for 2024:\n\n  * Year 1: You can take 60% of the solar system\u2019s entire federal depreciation.\n  * Years 2 - 6: The remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule.\u00a0\n\nState-level depreciation benefits will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n### How Much Money Can You Save with Accelerated Depreciation on Commercial Solar?\n\nThe savings from depreciation will depend on the cost of your system and your federal and state tax brackets. That said, it can cover a significant portion of the installation cost.\n\nIn one example, for a $300,000 system, a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax rate saved 26.3% of the system\u2019s entire cost ($79,050).\u00a0\n\nDetermining the Basis of Depreciation with the Solar Federal Tax Credit\n\nThe federal investment tax credit can reduce the cost of going solar by 30% or more. But is the cost basis for the depreciation of your solar system calculated before or after the ITC?\n\nThe IRS splits the difference with you. That means if your tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% x .5]). So if your system costs $100,000 to install, you\u2019d depreciate on $85,000.\n\nIf you opt for the production tax credit (PTC) over the ITC, your depreciable basis will not be reduced. You can depreciate the full 100% of the system\u2019s cost \u2014 not just 85%. However, the PTC typically only makes sense for very large, utility-scale systems.\n\nThe Future of Accelerated Depreciation Benefits for Commercial Solar Panels\n\nAccelerated deprecation is slowly being phased out. Beyond 2024, the 60% first-year bonus will drop each year in increments of 20%. In 2025, you\u2019ll be able to take 40%. In 2026, it\u2019ll be 20%, and in 2027, it\u2019ll be 0%.\n\nThe amount you\u2019ll receive for depreciation won\u2019t change as it\u2019s phased out, but the time at which you receive it will. In 2027, all depreciation on the system will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\n\n## How Will Solar Impact Your Business's Taxes?\n\nBetween the ITC\u2019s 30%+ savings and accelerated bonus depreciation, installing solar can instantly add savings to your business\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWant to know how much going solar can save your business?

assets.\n\nPresident Biden signed the \u301068\u2020Inflation Reduction Act\u3011 (IRA) into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA aims to limit inflation by reducing the deficit, investing in domestic energy production, and rewarding renewable energy. This article discusses how this landmark law impacts bonus depreciation and the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).\n\nTax professionals should be aware of these changes as they advise clients on capital investment and equipment purchases.\n\n## Three things to know about the new corporate AMT\n\n###### Bloomberg Tax Law Analyst Morgan Oliver, J.D., breaks down special rules for determining which corporations are subject to the CAMT, such as aggregating the income of all members in a closely related business group and employing an eligibility test for members of a foreign-parented multinational group.\n\n## Accelerated bonus depreciation\n\nAccelerated depreciation allows businesses to write off most property costs \u2013 vehicles, equipment, etc. \u2013 faster than under modified accelerated cost recovery (MACRS). The idea is that businesses can recoup part of these costs more quickly, allowing them to make capital investments that boost the economy while freeing up cash flow for other requirements.\n\nThe tax code has different methods of accelerated depreciation. One popular method is bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation lets businesses write off a portion of an asset\u2019s cost in its first year of use. A company can currently write off 100% of qualified equipment costs in the year it placed its service. This percentage is scheduled to drop to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, and 40% in 2025, until its wholly phased out in 2027.  \n\nThe IRA did not directly impact bonus depreciation. But it will impact accelerated depreciation deductions of large corporations via another aspect of the legislation: corporate AMT.\n\n### Corporate alternative minimum tax 2022\n\nCongress introduced the corporate AMT in 1986 to prevent large companies from using tax exemptions to avoid paying income taxes, despite high earnings. Corporate AMT was eventually repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nThe old version of the corporate AMT required companies to calculate their tax liability twice: once using the regular tax code and once using an alternative calculation without certain deductions. Then, the company paid whichever resulted in the highest tax bill.\n\nThe IRA of 2022 reintroduced the corporate AMT, but with major changes:\n\n  * It applies only to certain corporations (or a group of corporations treated as a single employer) with significant book-to-tax differences and a three-year average annual income over $1 billion from the prior three tax years.\n  * A company needs to pass the book income test only once to be subject to AMT. Unless the IRS specifies otherwise, it remains an applicable corporation.\n  * The new corporate AMT applies a 15% tax to a company\u2019s \u301069\u2020adjusted financial statement income\u2020irc.bloombergtax.com\u3011 (AFSI). AFSI is a company\u2019s net income or loss reported on it\u2019s applicable financial statements (AFS), such as a Form 10-K filed with the SEC, including tax and accounting adjustments. Accelerated depreciation is a tax adjustment (but not for book purposes).\n  * This aspect of the corporate AMT could substantially cut the minimum tax bill of corporations that invest heavily in the next few years. However, it will have less impact as bonus depreciation phases out unless Congress decides to extend it.\n  * The IRA either created or reinstated green energy \u301070\u2020tax credits\u3011. Combined with the AMT, these credits will affect corporations\u2019 decisions about bonus depreciation.\n\n### Bonus or no bonus\n\nDepreciation can factor into both regular and AMT tax calculations for corporations.\n\nSay a corporation wants to claim the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) before it expires at the end of 2024. However, the company must have tax liability in order to take advantage of t",

They reduce a fixed cost, impart your environmental values to your community, and they can help you save big on taxes.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019re focusing on the tax benefits you can take advantage of by installing solar for your business.\n\n## What Tax Benefits Are Available For Commercial Solar Panels?\n\nThere are two main ways solar energy saves businesses money on tax day:\n\n  * the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), and\n  * accelerated depreciation\u00a0\n\nEach works differently, but both keep more money in your bank account.\n\n## How Does The Federal Tax Credit Work for Commercial Solar?\n\nThe \u301018\u2020Solar Investment Tax Credit\u3011 (ITC) saves businesses a substantial amount on solar installation costs through a tax credit granted by the US Federal Government. Qualifying companies can recoup 30% or more of their solar investment.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work.  \n\nSolar Systems Under 1 MW AC Power\n\nSystems under 1 megawatt (MW) AC power will receive a tax credit of at least 30% of installation costs. For most businesses, this is the guaranteed rate until 2025.\u00a0\n\nYou could qualify for one or more adders, which increase the 30% credit.\n\n  * Energy communities (+10%): This aims to encourage the adoption of solar on some brownfield sites and in some communities with fossil-fuel-focused economies. \u301019\u2020Use this map \u2020arcgis.netl.doe.gov\u3011to see where they are.\u00a0\n  * Domestic content (+10%): To bolster American-made solar components, using domestic materials and equipment can save you more. However, it\u2019s hard to find products that will qualify.\u00a0\n  * Low-income areas (+10%): Businesses in areas that meet low-income qualifications can receive an additional 10% of the tax credit.\u00a0\n\nSolar Systems 1 - 5 MW AC Power\n\nSystems 1 to 5 MW AC power will receive the full 30% tax credit as of the writing of this blog. However, once the IRS issues additional guidelines, things change.\n\nOnce in effect, the tax credit for these larger systems will start at 6%. If the project meets certain conditions, the tax credit can increase to 70%. These include:\n\n  * Prevailing wage (+24%): You can gain the 30% credit if the project meets apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements.  \nEnergy communities (10%): Same as above\n  * Domestic content (10%): Same as above\n  * Low-income area (10%): Same as above\n\nLarger systems have a second option. Instead of the ITC, you can choose a \u301020\u2020production tax credit (PTC)\u2020www.solarpowerworldonline.com\u3011. With this, you\u2019ll earn credit for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity your system produces. The current rate is $0.026/kWh, but it\u2019ll increase with inflation.\n\n## When Can Businesses Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\n[Image 3: IRA Solar Tax Credit Commercial Carry Forward Rule]You don\u2019t have to use the credit for the year you installed your system. There\u2019s a 25-year window for when you can use your ITC.\n\nBusinesses can apply the credit to taxes they owe for any year from three years before the installation and up to 22 years after the installation.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you installed a system in 2024, you could apply your credit to taxes owed between the years 2021 to 2046.\n\n## Does A Business Need To Owe Taxes To Use The Solar Tax Credit?\n\nThe ITC has existed for a long time, but it changed in the 2020s. Before, businesses had to owe federal taxes to qualify for the credit. However, in 2022, the introduction of a transferability program changed this.\n\nIt\u2019s now possible for businesses to \u201ctransfer\u201d (or sell) their solar tax credit to a third party with tax liability.\u00a0\n\nBecause this is a relatively new incentive, support for these transactions is still developing. We expect to see firms and professionals specializing in brokering and administering these transfers very soon.\u00a0\n\nThat said, we do have some guidance on how it\u2019ll work:\n\n  * The owner of the system must register with the IRS to obtain a registration number.\n  * The tax credit can be transferred to multiple parties (e.g., one business purchases 40% and another purchases 60%).\n  * The credit can only be transferred once.\n  * It must be a cash transaction.\n  * You can\u2019t transfer the credit to a related party (e.g., business partner, family member, etc.)\n  * If the system owner sells the system within the first six years, the transferee is responsible for any tax liability triggered by the solar system\u2019s ownership change.\n\nWhile some unknowns exist, this program makes solar more viable for even more businesses and nonprofits.\n\n[Image 4: New call-to-action]\n\n## The Other Tax Incentive For Commercial Solar: Accelerated Depreciation\n\nLike machinery, equipment, and buildings, your solar panel system will depreciate. And you can reap the benefits of this on your taxes.\n\nCommercial solar panel systems qualify for \u301021\u2020accelerated bonus depreciation\u3011, which applies to federal depreciation only.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for 2024:\n\n  * Year 1: You can take 60% of the solar system\u2019s entire federal depreciation.\n  * Years 2 - 6: The remaining 40% will follow the five-year MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) schedule.\u00a0\n\nState-level depreciation benefits will follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule.\u00a0\n\n### How Much Money Can You Save with Accelerated Depreciation on Commercial Solar?\n\nThe savings from depreciation will depend on the cost of your system and your federal and state tax brackets. That said, it can cover a significant portion of the installation cost.\n\nIn one example, for a $300,000 system, a 24% federal tax rate and a 7% state tax rate saved 26.3% of the system\u2019s entire cost ($79,050).\u00a0\n\nDetermining the Basis of Depreciation with the Solar Federal Tax Credit\n\nThe federal investment tax credit can reduce the cost of going solar by 30% or more. But is the cost basis for the depreciation of your solar system calculated before or after the ITC?\n\nThe IRS splits the difference with you. That means if your tax credit is 30%, the depreciable basis would be 85% of the total cost (100% - [30% x .5]). So if your system costs $100,000 to install, you\u2019d depreciate on $85,000.\n\nIf you opt for the production tax credit (PTC) over the ITC, your depreciable basis will not be reduced. You can depreciate the full 100% of the system\u2019s cost \u2014 not just 85%. However, the PTC typically only makes sense for very large, utility-scale systems.\n\nThe Future of Accelerated Depreciation Benefits for Commercial Solar Panels\n\nAccelerated deprecation is slowly being phased out. Beyond 2024, the 60% first-year bonus will drop each year in increments of 20%. In 2025, you\u2019ll be able to take 40%. In 2026, it\u2019ll be 20%, and in 2027, it\u2019ll be 0%.\n\nThe amount you\u2019ll receive for depreciation won\u2019t change as it\u2019s phased out, but the time at which you receive it will. In 2027, all depreciation on the system will follow the five-year MACRS schedule.\n\n## How Will Solar Impact Your Business's Taxes?\n\nBetween the ITC\u2019s 30%+ savings and accelerated bonus depreciation, installing solar can instantly add savings to your business\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWant to know how much going solar can save your business?

This limit is reduced by the amount by which the cost of section 179 property placed in service during the tax year exceeds $2,700,000.Also, the maximum section 179 expense deduction for sport utility vehicles placed in service in tax years beginning in 2022 is $27,000.\n# \u301018\u2020Significant Changes Occurring to Depreciation in 2023\u2020www.dmcpas.com\u3011\nFirst, Section 179 only allows the full deduction up to a certain threshold amount ($1,080,000 in 2022). Once you reach the full threshold, you are no longer able to take an additional deduction. For example, if you place in service $1,100,000 of qualified property in 2022, you are only able to take Section 179 expense of $1,080,000.\n# \u301019\u2020What is the maximum amount for a Section 179 Deduction in 2024 ...\u2020www.creative-advising.com\u3011\nFor 2024, this means that the property must be in use by December 31, 2024.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made significant changes to both Section 179 and bonus depreciation. These changes continue to be in effect for 2023 and when used together may allow businesses to deduct up to 100% of capital purchases.\u00a0However, it will only be 100% if the amount of the equipment is under the phase-out threshold and can be expensed solely under Section 179.\u00a0 If it's over the limit and/or threshold, bonus depreciation will kick in, which is only 80% for 2023.  \n\nRead on for an overview of both deductions and how they could save you money during this tax year.\n\n## What is Section 179, and how has it changed?\n\nInternal Revenue Code Section 179 allows businesses to expense the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and/or software purchased during the tax year. When you buy a piece of qualifying equipment, you may be able to deduct the full purchase price on your business income tax return.\n\nBefore the TCJA, the government capped business taxpayers\u2019 Section 179 deduction at $500,000, with a phase-out beginning at $2 million. The new Act raised the deduction limit to $1 million and the phase-out threshold to $2.5 million, including annual adjustments for inflation.\u00a0In 2023, the Section 179 benefits apply to small and mid-size businesses that spend less than $4.05 million per year for equipment.\n\n## What is changing in 2023?\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nSection 179 Maximum Deduction\n\n$1,000,000\n\n$1,040,000\n\n$1,050,000\n\n$1,080,000\n\n$1,160,000\n\nPhase-out threshold\n\n$2,500,000\n\n$2,590,000\n\n$2,620,000\n\n$2,700,000\n\n$2,890,000\n\nBonus Depreciation\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\nEquipment\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\n## What is Bonus Depreciation  \n\nBonus Depreciation, is an additional first-year depreciation allowance. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), bonus depreciation allows business taxpayers to deduct additional depreciation for the cost of qualifying business property, beyond normal depreciation allowances. It\u2019s intended to spur capital purchases by all business taxpayers, small, mid-sized and large.\n\nBefore the TCJA, the IRS limited Bonus Depreciation to new equipment. The law now allows for depreciation on used equipment, though it must be \u201cfirst use\u201d by the purchasing business. The rules allow Bonus Depreciation to 100% for all qualified purchases made between September 27, 2017 and January 1, 2023. Bonus Depreciation now ramps down to 80%, starting in 2023.\u00a0Bonus depreciation will continue to ramp down for ensuing years: 60% for 2024, 40% for 2025, 20% for 2026, and 0% beginning in 2027.\n\n## How can both deductions work together?\n\nWhile each deduction can help businesses deduct purchasing costs for their property, combining them can offer the greatest possible benefits. IRS rules require that most businesses apply Section 179 first, followed by bonus depreciation.\n\nHere\u2019s why you might consider using both deductions:\u00a0\n\n  * Limited circumstances for stand-alone 179 benefits.  \nThe Section 179 expense limit and phase-out threshold (inflation-adjusted to $1,160,000 and $2,890,000, respectively, for 2023) are now permanent parts of the tax code. However, since Bonus Deprecation now covers new and used equipment, the benefits of Section 179 by themselves would only apply to taxpayers with specific business circumstances.\n\n  * Short-term consistency with the bonus depreciation limit.  \nWith the Bonus Depreciation percentage set at 80% for 2023, and ramping down further in subsequent years, businesses have greater incentive to make near-term purchases.\n\n  * Expands qualifying equipment beyond physical hardware.  \nQualified equipment includes software, which may mean that companies that aren\u2019t necessarily purchasing heavy equipment can benefit from the Section 179 and bonus depreciation rules. Also note that equipment investments exceeding $4,050,000 are not eligible for any Section 179 deduction, but may still be eligible for bonus depreciation.\n\n## Calculate your potential savings\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Section 179 and bonus depreciation could affect your business tax deductions, check out the calculator below.\n\n2023 Example\n\nCost of equipment\n\n$3,000,000\n\nSection 179 deduction\n\n$1,050,000\n\nBonus depreciation deduction\n\n$1,560,000\n\nStandard first year depreciation (assuming 5-year MACRS property)\n\n$78,000\n\nTotal first year deduction\n\n$2,688,000\n\nCash savings on purchase (assuming 21% C-Corp tax bracket\n\n$564,480\n\nLowered cost of equipment (after tax savings)\n\n$2,435,520\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about how t",

The new Act raised the deduction limit to $1 million and the phase-out threshold to $2.5 million, including annual adjustments for inflation.\u00a0In 2023, the Section 179 benefits apply to small and mid-size businesses that spend less than $4.05 million per year for equipment.\n\n## What is changing in 2023?\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nSection 179 Maximum Deduction\n\n$1,000,000\n\n$1,040,000\n\n$1,050,000\n\n$1,080,000\n\n$1,160,000\n\nPhase-out threshold\n\n$2,500,000\n\n$2,590,000\n\n$2,620,000\n\n$2,700,000\n\n$2,890,000\n\nBonus Depreciation\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\nEquipment\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\nNew and used for both\n\n## What is Bonus Depreciation  \n\nBonus Depreciation, is an additional first-year depreciation allowance. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), bonus depreciation allows business taxpayers to deduct additional depreciation for the cost of qualifying business property, beyond normal depreciation allowances. It\u2019s intended to spur capital purchases by all business taxpayers, small, mid-sized and large.\n\nBefore the TCJA, the IRS limited Bonus Depreciation to new equipment. The law now allows for depreciation on used equipment, though it must be \u201cfirst use\u201d by the purchasing business. The rules allow Bonus Depreciation to 100% for all qualified purchases made between September 27, 2017 and January 1, 2023. Bonus Depreciation now ramps down to 80%, starting in 2023.\u00a0Bonus depreciation will continue to ramp down for ensuing years: 60% for 2024, 40% for 2025, 20% for 2026, and 0% beginning in 2027.\n\n## How can both deductions work together?\n\nWhile each deduction can help businesses deduct purchasing costs for their property, combining them can offer the greatest possible benefits. IRS rules require that most businesses apply Section 179 first, followed by bonus depreciation.\n\nHere\u2019s why you might consider using both deductions:\u00a0\n\n  * Limited circumstances for stand-alone 179 benefits.  \nThe Section 179 expense limit and phase-out threshold (inflation-adjusted to $1,160,000 and $2,890,000, respectively, for 2023) are now permanent parts of the tax code. However, since Bonus Deprecation now covers new and used equipment, the benefits of Section 179 by themselves would only apply to taxpayers with specific business circumstances.\n\n  * Short-term consistency with the bonus depreciation limit.  \nWith the Bonus Depreciation percentage set at 80% for 2023, and ramping down further in subsequent years, businesses have greater incentive to make near-term purchases.\n\n  * Expands qualifying equipment beyond physical hardware.  \nQualified equipment includes software, which may mean that companies that aren\u2019t necessarily purchasing heavy equipment can benefit from the Section 179 and bonus depreciation rules. Also note that equipment investments exceeding $4,050,000 are not eligible for any Section 179 deduction, but may still be eligible for bonus depreciation.\n\n## Calculate your potential savings\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Section 179 and bonus depreciation could affect your business tax deductions, check out the calculator below.\n\n2023 Example\n\nCost of equipment\n\n$3,000,000\n\nSection 179 deduction\n\n$1,050,000\n\nBonus depreciation deduction\n\n$1,560,000\n\nStandard first year depreciation (assuming 5-year MACRS property)\n\n$78,000\n\nTotal first year deduction\n\n$2,688,000\n\nCash savings on purchase (assuming 21% C-Corp tax bracket\n\n$564,480\n\nLowered cost of equipment (after tax savings)\n\n$2,435,520\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about how t",

          "text": "\n### Deductibility of research and experimentation (R&E) expenses under Section 174\u00a0\n\nBeginning in 2022, R&E expenses are \u301097\u2020required to be capitalized and amortized\u3011\u00a0over five years for amounts related to research conducted in the United States and 15 years for research conducted outside of the United States. Prior to 2022, R&E expenses were immediately deductible. The proposal would restore the ability of taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic R&E expenditures through 2025. The treatment of foreign R&E expenses would remain unchanged, so they would continue to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years. The proposal also contains a number of coordinating amendments to fix the manner in which R&E expense capitalization interacts with other areas of tax law such as the requirement to not deduct expenses equal to a research credit and the alternative minimum tax treatment.\n\nThe capitalization of R&E expenses has raised complex technical questions while limiting annual deductions. The proposal provides key relief; however, the retention of capitalization of foreign R&E means that many taxpayers will still need to complete annual R&E studies. The IRS and Treasury are already deep in the process of developing guidance on R&E expense capitalization so it\u2019s possible that these changes could significantly delay that process. Deferring technical guidance may cause taxpayers with foreign R&E expenses to continue to grapple with these complex technical questions for quite a bit longer.\n\nMost taxpayers have already filed their 2022 tax returns and capitalized R&E expenses. The proposal permits taxpayers to deduct their capitalized domestic R&E expenses by either amending their 2022 tax returns or making an accounting method change with their 2023 tax returns. Taxpayers opting for the accounting method change route would be permitted to elect to take the entire deduction in 2023 or spread it evenly between 2023 and 2024.\n\nMany taxpayers will likely be faced with important procedural questions depending on the significance of the amount of domestic R&E expenses that were capitalized. Net operating losses can no longer be carried back, and taxable income may drive many other calculations, including the Section 163(j) limitation and foreign tax credits. Whether there is a larger tax benefit by deducting these amounts in 2022, 2023, or across 2023 and 2024 may not always be clear without detailed modeling. Any benefits of deducting these amounts in 2022 may also need to be balanced against the administrative costs of amending tax returns. This is particularly true for partnerships that may not be able to amend their tax returns but would be required to file administrative adjustment requests (AARs). It\u2019s possible that a tax benefit reported on an AAR could result in \u3010100\u2020no tax refund to a partner\u3011\u00a0depending on that partner\u2019s personal tax situation for the year in which the AAR is filed.\n\n### Deductibility of business interest expenses under Section 163(j)\n\nThe Section 163(j) limitation applies an annual cap on the ability of businesses to deduct interest expense. The limitation is generally 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), calculated as taxable income before net interest expense and with several other additions and subtractions. For tax years beginning before 2022, the computation of ATI included an addback for depreciation, amortization, and depletion deductions. However, beginning in 2022, such deductions were no longer added back, which reduced the overall amount of interest expense deductions available to many businesses.\n\nThe proposal would restore the depreciation, amortization, and depletion addback in 2024 and 2025. Further, taxpayers would be permitted to elect to apply such addbacks to 2022 and 2023. The current legislative text indicates that such election would apply to both 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe change to the ATI computation would be welcome news to many businesses. Since 2022, the ATI computation change has meaningfully restricted interest expense deductions. That tighter computation was also applied during a period in which interest rates were increasing and 100% bonus depreciation was widely applied. Taken together, those factors have resulted in a Section 163(j) limitation that significantly increased tax payments for many businesses.\n\nThe inclusion of an elective regime for 2022 and 2023 would provide helpful flexibility for taxpayers. Interest expense deductions that are limited in one year carry forward to the next year. In some cases, the expanded ATI computation in 2024 and 2025 may be sufficient to allow for the deduction of both current and carryforward interest expense. In such case, choosing not to apply the elective retroactivity would eliminate the need to file amended tax returns or AARs. However, other taxpayers who don\u2019t expect to be able to absorb carryforwards in the near future may be more inclined to amend previous tax returns or file AARs. Of note, that decision will be complicated by the fact that a business that elects to apply the more favorable rule in its 2023 tax return would appear to be committing to amend its 2022 tax return as well, so there may not be a middle ground. As noted above with respect to R&E expenses, partnerships that would be required to file AARs may have a much harder choice to ensure that partners do not end up \u3010100\u2020losing tax benefits\u3011\u00a0all together.\n\n### Restoration of 100% bonus depreciation \n\nThe TCJA expanded and extended bonus depreciation, providing 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2022. \u301098\u2020Bonus depreciation\u3011\u00a0was then subject to an annual 20% decrease in expensing for property placed in service during each calendar year after 2022 (e.g., 80% in 2023; 60% in 2024; 40% in 2025; 20% in 2026; and 0% in 2027 and later years).\n\nThe proposal extends 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2025. It would retain existing law for 2026 and later years, so 20% expensing would apply to property placed in service in 2026, and no bonus depreciation would exist in subsequent years.\n\nThe most immediate impact of this change is permitting 100% bonus depreciation in 2023 rather than the previously scheduled 80%. Since most 2023 tax returns have not yet been filed, this change would be implemented on original 2023 tax returns for most taxpayers.\n\n### Employee retention credit (ERC) enforcement \n\nSince enactment in March 2020, the employee retention credit (ERC) has been the subject of continual amendments and developments. Initially, those included technical changes to the rules and modification of the effective dates. More recently, developments in the marketplace have triggered a series of escalating enforcement measures by the IRS. Those began with \u3010101\u2020warnings\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011 about improper claims, advanced to a \u3010102\u2020temporary pause\u3011\u00a0on new claim processing, and more recently involved the deployment of \u3010103\u2020claim withdrawal\u3011\u00a0and \u3010104\u2020voluntary disclosure\u3011\u00a0programs. The proposal would go further by modifying the program while focusing enforcement efforts on promoters of ERC refund claims. The proposed changes are also expected to largely cover the cost of the rest of the proposal.\n\nMost importantly, the deadline to file refund claims for the ERC would be Jan. 31, 2024. Under current law, most taxpayers have until April 15, 2024, for 2020 ERC refund claims and April 15, 2025, for 2021 ERC refund claims. The proposal would also extend the statute of limitations for the IRS to assess tax to six years for ERCs. Under existing law, a three-year statute of limitations applies to most ERCs, while a five-year statute of limitations applies to ERC for the third and fourth quarters of 2021. The proposal would apply a uniform six-year statute of limitations to all ERC claims. Such statute will run based on the latest of three triggering events: (1) the filing date of the original return for the applicable calendar quarter, (2) the date on which the return is treated as filed under current statute of limitations rules, and (3) the date on which the credit or refund claim is made. The proposal would also coordinate the income tax statute of limitations of the ERC wage deduction disallowance so that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be adversely impacted by an ERC refund claim deemed invalid after the standard statute of limitations on income taxes had expired.\n\nThe proposal has the most immediate impact on taxpayers who have been debating whether to file an ERC refund claim by providing a very limited window in which to make a final decision. While these provisions make clear that Congress is concerned about abusive ERC refund claims, the proposal generally doesn\u2019t directly impact ERC refund claims that have already been filed. However, the extended statute of limitations may cause more taxpayers who have already received their refunds to be examined years into the future.\n\nAll other ERC provisions in the proposal are focused on promoters and advisors with respect to ERC claims. These provisions include substantially increasing penalties for those aiding and abetting a taxpayer\u2019s understatement of tax, requiring paid preparers to perform certain diligence requirements when advising on ERC refund claims, and requiring ERC promoters to follow reportable transaction list maintenance requirements. These provisions have varying effective dates.\n\n### Other items in the bipartisan tax package \n\nThe proposal would also provide for several additional tax changes to both businesses and individuals:\n\n  * Expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 The proposal would expand the refundability of the child tax credit and also index the $2,000 credit to inflation for 2024 and 2025.\n  * Disaster relief \u2014 Congress has historically enacted periodic legislation that eliminates the 10% of adjusted gross income floor for deducting certain casualty losses, eliminates the $500 floor on each casualty loss, and permits casualty losses to be deducted even when a taxpayer doesn\u2019t itemize. The proposal would extend these provisions for most Presidentially declared disasters occurring from Dec. 28, 2019, through the date of enactment. The proposal would also exclude from income certain wildfire relief payments received",

            "Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and/or software purchased or financed during the tax year, essentially enabling businesses to lower their taxable income by the cost of the acquired assets. For the taxable year 2024, the limit for Section 179 deductions has been set at $1,220,000, with the phase-out threshold starting at $3,050,000 in equipment purchases. This means that the full deduction is available up to the specified limit, beyond which it begins to reduce dollar-for-dollar, eliminating completely once equipment purchases exceed the phase-out threshold\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFurthermore, there have been discussions and proposals aimed at expanding and adjusting various tax provisions, including Section 179. One notable development includes proposals to extend and modify deductions and credits relevant to businesses. For instance, there's a proposal to extend 100% bonus depreciation for property placed in service through 2025, with the phase-down schedule to begin in 2026 as planned previously. This change aims to encourage more immediate capital investment by allowing businesses to fully expense qualifying property in the year it's placed in service\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n\nAdditionally, changes are being considered for the deductibility of research and experimentation (R&E) expenses and business interest expenses under Sections 174 and 163(j), respectively. These adjustments are intended to provide relief and flexibility for businesses in managing their taxable income and deductions. For example, the proposal suggests allowing immediate deduction of domestic R&E expenses through 2025, with foreign R&E expenses continuing to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n\nOverall, these potential changes under consideration aim to encourage investment and innovation by providing tax incentives for businesses to invest in equipment, property, and research activities. Businesses interested in taking advantage of these deductions should closely monitor legislative developments and consult with tax professionals to understand how these changes may affect their tax planning and financial decisions."

                "text": "\n### Deductibility of research and experimentation (R&E) expenses under Section 174\u00a0\n\nBeginning in 2022, R&E expenses are \u301097\u2020required to be capitalized and amortized\u3011\u00a0over five years for amounts related to research conducted in the United States and 15 years for research conducted outside of the United States. Prior to 2022, R&E expenses were immediately deductible. The proposal would restore the ability of taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic R&E expenditures through 2025. The treatment of foreign R&E expenses would remain unchanged, so they would continue to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years. The proposal also contains a number of coordinating amendments to fix the manner in which R&E expense capitalization interacts with other areas of tax law such as the requirement to not deduct expenses equal to a research credit and the alternative minimum tax treatment.\n\nThe capitalization of R&E expenses has raised complex technical questions while limiting annual deductions. The proposal provides key relief; however, the retention of capitalization of foreign R&E means that many taxpayers will still need to complete annual R&E studies. The IRS and Treasury are already deep in the process of developing guidance on R&E expense capitalization so it\u2019s possible that these changes could significantly delay that process. Deferring technical guidance may cause taxpayers with foreign R&E expenses to continue to grapple with these complex technical questions for quite a bit longer.\n\nMost taxpayers have already filed their 2022 tax returns and capitalized R&E expenses. The proposal permits taxpayers to deduct their capitalized domestic R&E expenses by either amending their 2022 tax returns or making an accounting method change with their 2023 tax returns. Taxpayers opting for the accounting method change route would be permitted to elect to take the entire deduction in 2023 or spread it evenly between 2023 and 2024.\n\nMany taxpayers will likely be faced with important procedural questions depending on the significance of the amount of domestic R&E expenses that were capitalized. Net operating losses can no longer be carried back, and taxable income may drive many other calculations, including the Section 163(j) limitation and foreign tax credits. Whether there is a larger tax benefit by deducting these amounts in 2022, 2023, or across 2023 and 2024 may not always be clear without detailed modeling. Any benefits of deducting these amounts in 2022 may also need to be balanced against the administrative costs of amending tax returns. This is particularly true for partnerships that may not be able to amend their tax returns but would be required to file administrative adjustment requests (AARs). It\u2019s possible that a tax benefit reported on an AAR could result in \u3010100\u2020no tax refund to a partner\u3011\u00a0depending on that partner\u2019s personal tax situation for the year in which the AAR is filed.\n\n### Deductibility of business interest expenses under Section 163(j)\n\nThe Section 163(j) limitation applies an annual cap on the ability of businesses to deduct interest expense. The limitation is generally 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), calculated as taxable income before net interest expense and with several other additions and subtractions. For tax years beginning before 2022, the computation of ATI included an addback for depreciation, amortization, and depletion deductions. However, beginning in 2022, such deductions were no longer added back, which reduced the overall amount of interest expense deductions available to many businesses.\n\nThe proposal would restore the depreciation, amortization, and depletion addback in 2024 and 2025. Further, taxpayers would be permitted to elect to apply such addbacks to 2022 and 2023. The current legislative text indicates that such election would apply to both 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe change to the ATI computation would be welcome news to many businesses. Since 2022, the ATI computation change has meaningfully restricted interest expense deductions. That tighter computation was also applied during a period in which interest rates were increasing and 100% bonus depreciation was widely applied. Taken together, those factors have resulted in a Section 163(j) limitation that significantly increased tax payments for many businesses.\n\nThe inclusion of an elective regime for 2022 and 2023 would provide helpful flexibility for taxpayers. Interest expense deductions that are limited in one year carry forward to the next year. In some cases, the expanded ATI computation in 2024 and 2025 may be sufficient to allow for the deduction of both current and carryforward interest expense. In such case, choosing not to apply the elective retroactivity would eliminate the need to file amended tax returns or AARs. However, other taxpayers who don\u2019t expect to be able to absorb carryforwards in the near future may be more inclined to amend previous tax returns or file AARs. Of note, that decision will be complicated by the fact that a business that elects to apply the more favorable rule in its 2023 tax return would appear to be committing to amend its 2022 tax return as well, so there may not be a middle ground. As noted above with respect to R&E expenses, partnerships that would be required to file AARs may have a much harder choice to ensure that partners do not end up \u3010100\u2020losing tax benefits\u3011\u00a0all together.\n\n### Restoration of 100% bonus depreciation \n\nThe TCJA expanded and extended bonus depreciation, providing 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2022. \u301098\u2020Bonus depreciation\u3011\u00a0was then subject to an annual 20% decrease in expensing for property placed in service during each calendar year after 2022 (e.g., 80% in 2023; 60% in 2024; 40% in 2025; 20% in 2026; and 0% in 2027 and later years).\n\nThe proposal extends 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2025. It would retain existing law for 2026 and later years, so 20% expensing would apply to property placed in service in 2026, and no bonus depreciation would exist in subsequent years.\n\nThe most immediate impact of this change is permitting 100% bonus depreciation in 2023 rather than the previously scheduled 80%. Since most 2023 tax returns have not yet been filed, this change would be implemented on original 2023 tax returns for most taxpayers.\n\n### Employee retention credit (ERC) enforcement \n\nSince enactment in March 2020, the employee retention credit (ERC) has been the subject of continual amendments and developments. Initially, those included technical changes to the rules and modification of the effective dates. More recently, developments in the marketplace have triggered a series of escalating enforcement measures by the IRS. Those began with \u3010101\u2020warnings\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011 about improper claims, advanced to a \u3010102\u2020temporary pause\u3011\u00a0on new claim processing, and more recently involved the deployment of \u3010103\u2020claim withdrawal\u3011\u00a0and \u3010104\u2020voluntary disclosure\u3011\u00a0programs. The proposal would go further by modifying the program while focusing enforcement efforts on promoters of ERC refund claims. The proposed changes are also expected to largely cover the cost of the rest of the proposal.\n\nMost importantly, the deadline to file refund claims for the ERC would be Jan. 31, 2024. Under current law, most taxpayers have until April 15, 2024, for 2020 ERC refund claims and April 15, 2025, for 2021 ERC refund claims. The proposal would also extend the statute of limitations for the IRS to assess tax to six years for ERCs. Under existing law, a three-year statute of limitations applies to most ERCs, while a five-year statute of limitations applies to ERC for the third and fourth quarters of 2021. The proposal would apply a uniform six-year statute of limitations to all ERC claims. Such statute will run based on the latest of three triggering events: (1) the filing date of the original return for the applicable calendar quarter, (2) the date on which the return is treated as filed under current statute of limitations rules, and (3) the date on which the credit or refund claim is made. The proposal would also coordinate the income tax statute of limitations of the ERC wage deduction disallowance so that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be adversely impacted by an ERC refund claim deemed invalid after the standard statute of limitations on income taxes had expired.\n\nThe proposal has the most immediate impact on taxpayers who have been debating whether to file an ERC refund claim by providing a very limited window in which to make a final decision. While these provisions make clear that Congress is concerned about abusive ERC refund claims, the proposal generally doesn\u2019t directly impact ERC refund claims that have already been filed. However, the extended statute of limitations may cause more taxpayers who have already received their refunds to be examined years into the future.\n\nAll other ERC provisions in the proposal are focused on promoters and advisors with respect to ERC claims. These provisions include substantially increasing penalties for those aiding and abetting a taxpayer\u2019s understatement of tax, requiring paid preparers to perform certain diligence requirements when advising on ERC refund claims, and requiring ERC promoters to follow reportable transaction list maintenance requirements. These provisions have varying effective dates.\n\n### Other items in the bipartisan tax package \n\nThe proposal would also provide for several additional tax changes to both businesses and individuals:\n\n  * Expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 The proposal would expand the refundability of the child tax credit and also index the $2,000 credit to inflation for 2024 and 2025.\n  * Disaster relief \u2014 Congress has historically enacted periodic legislation that eliminates the 10% of adjusted gross income floor for deducting certain casualty losses, eliminates the $500 floor on each casualty loss, and permits casualty losses to be deducted even when a taxpayer doesn\u2019t itemize. The proposal would extend these provisions for most Presidentially declared disasters occurring from Dec. 28, 2019, through the date of enactment. The proposal would also exclude from income certain wildfire relief payments received",

The proposal permits taxpayers to deduct their capitalized domestic R&E expenses by either amending their 2022 tax returns or making an accounting method change with their 2023 tax returns. Taxpayers opting for the accounting method change route would be permitted to elect to take the entire deduction in 2023 or spread it evenly between 2023 and 2024.\n\nMany taxpayers will likely be faced with important procedural questions depending on the significance of the amount of domestic R&E expenses that were capitalized. Net operating losses can no longer be carried back, and taxable income may drive many other calculations, including the Section 163(j) limitation and foreign tax credits. Whether there is a larger tax benefit by deducting these amounts in 2022, 2023, or across 2023 and 2024 may not always be clear without detailed modeling. Any benefits of deducting these amounts in 2022 may also need to be balanced against the administrative costs of amending tax returns. This is particularly true for partnerships that may not be able to amend their tax returns but would be required to file administrative adjustment requests (AARs). It\u2019s possible that a tax benefit reported on an AAR could result in \u3010100\u2020no tax refund to a partner\u3011\u00a0depending on that partner\u2019s personal tax situation for the year in which the AAR is filed.\n\n### Deductibility of business interest expenses under Section 163(j)\n\nThe Section 163(j) limitation applies an annual cap on the ability of businesses to deduct interest expense. The limitation is generally 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), calculated as taxable income before net interest expense and with several other additions and subtractions. For tax years beginning before 2022, the computation of ATI included an addback for depreciation, amortization, and depletion deductions. However, beginning in 2022, such deductions were no longer added back, which reduced the overall amount of interest expense deductions available to many businesses.\n\nThe proposal would restore the depreciation, amortization, and depletion addback in 2024 and 2025. Further, taxpayers would be permitted to elect to apply such addbacks to 2022 and 2023. The current legislative text indicates that such election would apply to both 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe change to the ATI computation would be welcome news to many businesses. Since 2022, the ATI computation change has meaningfully restricted interest expense deductions. That tighter computation was also applied during a period in which interest rates were increasing and 100% bonus depreciation was widely applied. Taken together, those factors have resulted in a Section 163(j) limitation that significantly increased tax payments for many businesses.\n\nThe inclusion of an elective regime for 2022 and 2023 would provide helpful flexibility for taxpayers. Interest expense deductions that are limited in one year carry forward to the next year. In some cases, the expanded ATI computation in 2024 and 2025 may be sufficient to allow for the deduction of both current and carryforward interest expense. In such case, choosing not to apply the elective retroactivity would eliminate the need to file amended tax returns or AARs. However, other taxpayers who don\u2019t expect to be able to absorb carryforwards in the near future may be more inclined to amend previous tax returns or file AARs. Of note, that decision will be complicated by the fact that a business that elects to apply the more favorable rule in its 2023 tax return would appear to be committing to amend its 2022 tax return as well, so there may not be a middle ground. As noted above with respect to R&E expenses, partnerships that would be required to file AARs may have a much harder choice to ensure that partners do not end up \u3010100\u2020losing tax benefits\u3011\u00a0all together.\n\n### Restoration of 100% bonus depreciation \n\nThe TCJA expanded and extended bonus depreciation, providing 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2022. \u301098\u2020Bonus depreciation\u3011\u00a0was then subject to an annual 20% decrease in expensing for property placed in service during each calendar year after 2022 (e.g., 80% in 2023; 60% in 2024; 40% in 2025; 20% in 2026; and 0% in 2027 and later years).\n\nThe proposal extends 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2025. It would retain existing law for 2026 and later years, so 20% expensing would apply to property placed in service in 2026, and no bonus depreciation would exist in subsequent years.\n\nThe most immediate impact of this change is permitting 100% bonus depreciation in 2023 rather than the previously scheduled 80%. Since most 2023 tax returns have not yet been filed, this change would be implemented on original 2023 tax returns for most taxpayers.\n\n### Employee retention credit (ERC) enforcement \n\nSince enactment in March 2020, the employee retention credit (ERC) has been the subject of continual amendments and developments. Initially, those included technical changes to the rules and modification of the effective dates. More recently, developments in the marketplace have triggered a series of escalating enforcement measures by the IRS. Those began with \u3010101\u2020warnings\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011 about improper claims, advanced to a \u3010102\u2020temporary pause\u3011\u00a0on new claim processing, and more recently involved the deployment of \u3010103\u2020claim withdrawal\u3011\u00a0and \u3010104\u2020voluntary disclosure\u3011\u00a0programs. The proposal would go further by modifying the program while focusing enforcement efforts on promoters of ERC refund claims. The proposed changes are also expected to largely cover the cost of the rest of the proposal.\n\nMost importantly, the deadline to file refund claims for the ERC would be Jan. 31, 2024. Under current law, most taxpayers have until April 15, 2024, for 2020 ERC refund claims and April 15, 2025, for 2021 ERC refund claims. The proposal would also extend the statute of limitations for the IRS to assess tax to six years for ERCs. Under existing law, a three-year statute of limitations applies to most ERCs, while a five-year statute of limitations applies to ERC for the third and fourth quarters of 2021. The proposal would apply a uniform six-year statute of limitations to all ERC claims. Such statute will run based on the latest of three triggering events: (1) the filing date of the original return for the applicable calendar quarter, (2) the date on which the return is treated as filed under current statute of limitations rules, and (3) the date on which the credit or refund claim is made. The proposal would also coordinate the income tax statute of limitations of the ERC wage deduction disallowance so that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be adversely impacted by an ERC refund claim deemed invalid after the standard statute of limitations on income taxes had expired.\n\nThe proposal has the most immediate impact on taxpayers who have been debating whether to file an ERC refund claim by providing a very limited window in which to make a final decision. While these provisions make clear that Congress is concerned about abusive ERC refund claims, the proposal generally doesn\u2019t directly impact ERC refund claims that have already been filed. However, the extended statute of limitations may cause more taxpayers who have already received their refunds to be examined years into the future.\n\nAll other ERC provisions in the proposal are focused on promoters and advisors with respect to ERC claims. These provisions include substantially increasing penalties for those aiding and abetting a taxpayer\u2019s understatement of tax, requiring paid preparers to perform certain diligence requirements when advising on ERC refund claims, and requiring ERC promoters to follow reportable transaction list maintenance requirements. These provisions have varying effective dates.\n\n### Other items in the bipartisan tax package \n\nThe proposal would also provide for several additional tax changes to both businesses and individuals:\n\n  * Expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 The proposal would expand the refundability of the child tax credit and also index the $2,000 credit to inflation for 2024 and 2025.\n  * Disaster relief \u2014 Congress has historically enacted periodic legislation that eliminates the 10% of adjusted gross income floor for deducting certain casualty losses, eliminates the $500 floor on each casualty loss, and permits casualty losses to be deducted even when a taxpayer doesn\u2019t itemize. The proposal would extend these provisions for most Presidentially declared disasters occurring from Dec. 28, 2019, through the date of enactment. The proposal would also exclude from income certain wildfire relief payments received",

Prior to 2022, R&E expenses were immediately deductible. The proposal would restore the ability of taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic R&E expenditures through 2025. The treatment of foreign R&E expenses would remain unchanged, so they would continue to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years. The proposal also contains a number of coordinating amendments to fix the manner in which R&E expense capitalization interacts with other areas of tax law such as the requirement to not deduct expenses equal to a research credit and the alternative minimum tax treatment.\n\nThe capitalization of R&E expenses has raised complex technical questions while limiting annual deductions. The proposal provides key relief; however, the retention of capitalization of foreign R&E means that many taxpayers will still need to complete annual R&E studies.

The proposal would also coordinate the income tax statute of limitations of the ERC wage deduction disallowance so that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be adversely impacted by an ERC refund claim deemed invalid after the standard statute of limitations on income taxes had expired.\n\nThe proposal has the most immediate impact on taxpayers who have been debating whether to file an ERC refund claim by providing a very limited window in which to make a final decision. While these provisions make clear that Congress is concerned about abusive ERC refund claims, the proposal generally doesn\u2019t directly impact ERC refund claims that have already been filed. However, the extended statute of limitations may cause more taxpayers who have already received their refunds to be examined years into the future.\n\nAll other ERC provisions in the proposal are focused on promoters and advisors with respect to ERC claims. These provisions include substantially increasing penalties for those aiding and abetting a taxpayer\u2019s understatement of tax, requiring paid preparers to perform certain diligence requirements when advising on ERC refund claims, and requiring ERC promoters to follow reportable transaction list maintenance requirements. These provisions have varying effective dates.\n\n### Other items in the bipartisan tax package \n\nThe proposal would also provide for several additional tax changes to both businesses and individuals:\n\n  * Expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 The proposal would expand the refundability of the child tax credit and also index the $2,000 credit to inflation for 2024 and 2025.\n  * Disaster relief \u2014 Congress has historically enacted periodic legislation that eliminates the 10% of adjusted gross income floor for deducting certain casualty losses, eliminates the $500 floor on each casualty loss, and permits casualty losses to be deducted even when a taxpayer doesn\u2019t itemize. The proposal would extend these provisions for most Presidentially declared disasters occurring from Dec. 28, 2019, through the date of enactment. The proposal would also exclude from income certain wildfire relief payments received",

              "snippet": "\n### Deductibility of research and experimentation (R&E) expenses under Section 174\u00a0\n\nBeginning in 2022, R&E expenses are \u301097\u2020required to be capitalized and amortized\u3011\u00a0over five years for amounts related to research conducted in the United States and 15 years for research conducted outside of the United States. Prior to 2022, R&E expenses were immediately deductible. The proposal would restore the ability of taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic R&E expenditures through 2025. The treatment of foreign R&E expenses would remain unchanged, so they would continue to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years. The proposal also contains a number of coordinating amendments to fix the manner in which R&E expense capitalization interacts with other areas of tax law such as the requirement to not deduct expenses equal to a research credit and the alternative minimum tax treatment.\n\nThe capitalization of R&E expenses has raised complex technical questions while limiting annual deductions. The proposal provides key relief; however, the retention of capitalization of foreign R&E means that many taxpayers will still need to complete annual R&E studies. The IRS and Treasury are already deep in the process of developing guidance on R&E expense capitalization so it\u2019s possible that these changes could significantly delay that process. Deferring technical guidance may cause taxpayers with foreign R&E expenses to continue to grapple with these complex technical questions for quite a bit longer.\n\nMost taxpayers have already filed their 2022 tax returns and capitalized R&E expenses. The proposal permits taxpayers to deduct their capitalized domestic R&E expenses by either amending their 2022 tax returns or making an accounting method change with their 2023 tax returns. Taxpayers opting for the accounting method change route would be permitted to elect to take the entire deduction in 2023 or spread it evenly between 2023 and 2024.\n\nMany taxpayers will likely be faced with important procedural questions depending on the significance of the amount of domestic R&E expenses that were capitalized. Net operating losses can no longer be carried back, and taxable income may drive many other calculations, including the Section 163(j) limitation and foreign tax credits. Whether there is a larger tax benefit by deducting these amounts in 2022, 2023, or across 2023 and 2024 may not always be clear without detailed modeling. Any benefits of deducting these amounts in 2022 may also need to be balanced against the administrative costs of amending tax returns. This is particularly true for partnerships that may not be able to amend their tax returns but would be required to file administrative adjustment requests (AARs). It\u2019s possible that a tax benefit reported on an AAR could result in \u3010100\u2020no tax refund to a partner\u3011\u00a0depending on that partner\u2019s personal tax situation for the year in which the AAR is filed.\n\n### Deductibility of business interest expenses under Section 163(j)\n\nThe Section 163(j) limitation applies an annual cap on the ability of businesses to deduct interest expense. The limitation is generally 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), calculated as taxable income before net interest expense and with several other additions and subtractions. For tax years beginning before 2022, the computation of ATI included an addback for depreciation, amortization, and depletion deductions. However, beginning in 2022, such deductions were no longer added back, which reduced the overall amount of interest expense deductions available to many businesses.\n\nThe proposal would restore the depreciation, amortization, and depletion addback in 2024 and 2025. Further, taxpayers would be permitted to elect to apply such addbacks to 2022 and 2023. The current legislative text indicates that such election would apply to both 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe change to the ATI computation would be welcome news to many businesses. Since 2022, the ATI computation change has meaningfully restricted interest expense deductions. That tighter computation was also applied during a period in which interest rates were increasing and 100% bonus depreciation was widely applied. Taken together, those factors have resulted in a Section 163(j) limitation that significantly increased tax payments for many businesses.\n\nThe inclusion of an elective regime for 2022 and 2023 would provide helpful flexibility for taxpayers. Interest expense deductions that are limited in one year carry forward to the next year. In some cases, the expanded ATI computation in 2024 and 2025 may be sufficient to allow for the deduction of both current and carryforward interest expense. In such case, choosing not to apply the elective retroactivity would eliminate the need to file amended tax returns or AARs. However, other taxpayers who don\u2019t expect to be able to absorb carryforwards in the near future may be more inclined to amend previous tax returns or file AARs. Of note, that decision will be complicated by the fact that a business that elects to apply the more favorable rule in its 2023 tax return would appear to be committing to amend its 2022 tax return as well, so there may not be a middle ground. As noted above with respect to R&E expenses, partnerships that would be required to file AARs may have a much harder choice to ensure that partners do not end up \u3010100\u2020losing tax benefits\u3011\u00a0all together.\n\n### Restoration of 100% bonus depreciation \n\nThe TCJA expanded and extended bonus depreciation, providing 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2022. \u301098\u2020Bonus depreciation\u3011\u00a0was then subject to an annual 20% decrease in expensing for property placed in service during each calendar year after 2022 (e.g., 80% in 2023; 60% in 2024; 40% in 2025; 20% in 2026; and 0% in 2027 and later years).\n\nThe proposal extends 100% expensing for property placed in service through 2025. It would retain existing law for 2026 and later years, so 20% expensing would apply to property placed in service in 2026, and no bonus depreciation would exist in subsequent years.\n\nThe most immediate impact of this change is permitting 100% bonus depreciation in 2023 rather than the previously scheduled 80%. Since most 2023 tax returns have not yet been filed, this change would be implemented on original 2023 tax returns for most taxpayers.\n\n### Employee retention credit (ERC) enforcement \n\nSince enactment in March 2020, the employee retention credit (ERC) has been the subject of continual amendments and developments. Initially, those included technical changes to the rules and modification of the effective dates. More recently, developments in the marketplace have triggered a series of escalating enforcement measures by the IRS. Those began with \u3010101\u2020warnings\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011 about improper claims, advanced to a \u3010102\u2020temporary pause\u3011\u00a0on new claim processing, and more recently involved the deployment of \u3010103\u2020claim withdrawal\u3011\u00a0and \u3010104\u2020voluntary disclosure\u3011\u00a0programs. The proposal would go further by modifying the program while focusing enforcement efforts on promoters of ERC refund claims. The proposed changes are also expected to largely cover the cost of the rest of the proposal.\n\nMost importantly, the deadline to file refund claims for the ERC would be Jan. 31, 2024. Under current law, most taxpayers have until April 15, 2024, for 2020 ERC refund claims and April 15, 2025, for 2021 ERC refund claims. The proposal would also extend the statute of limitations for the IRS to assess tax to six years for ERCs. Under existing law, a three-year statute of limitations applies to most ERCs, while a five-year statute of limitations applies to ERC for the third and fourth quarters of 2021. The proposal would apply a uniform six-year statute of limitations to all ERC claims. Such statute will run based on the latest of three triggering events: (1) the filing date of the original return for the applicable calendar quarter, (2) the date on which the return is treated as filed under current statute of limitations rules, and (3) the date on which the credit or refund claim is made. The proposal would also coordinate the income tax statute of limitations of the ERC wage deduction disallowance so that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be adversely impacted by an ERC refund claim deemed invalid after the standard statute of limitations on income taxes had expired.\n\nThe proposal has the most immediate impact on taxpayers who have been debating whether to file an ERC refund claim by providing a very limited window in which to make a final decision. While these provisions make clear that Congress is concerned about abusive ERC refund claims, the proposal generally doesn\u2019t directly impact ERC refund claims that have already been filed. However, the extended statute of limitations may cause more taxpayers who have already received their refunds to be examined years into the future.\n\nAll other ERC provisions in the proposal are focused on promoters and advisors with respect to ERC claims. These provisions include substantially increasing penalties for those aiding and abetting a taxpayer\u2019s understatement of tax, requiring paid preparers to perform certain diligence requirements when advising on ERC refund claims, and requiring ERC promoters to follow reportable transaction list maintenance requirements.

            "The eligibility of solar panels for deductions under Section 179 or the bonus depreciation provisions depends on whether they are considered \"qualifying property\" under the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, solar panels and other renewable energy equipment can qualify for both Section 179 deductions and bonus depreciation if they are used for business purposes.\n\nUnder Section 179, businesses are allowed to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment, which may include solar panels, up to a certain limit. This provision is designed to encourage businesses to invest in equipment, including energy-efficient or renewable energy systems, by offering an immediate expense deduction that can reduce taxable income.\n\nBonus depreciation rules, which have been modified over time, allow businesses to deduct a significant portion of the purchase price of new property that is placed in service during the tax year. Solar panels could qualify for bonus depreciation, allowing businesses to accelerate the depreciation deductions, thus reducing taxable income more significantly in the year the solar panels are installed.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and subsequent legislation have expanded and extended the applicability of these deductions, including for renewable energy investments. For solar panels and related equipment, this means businesses can potentially recover costs more quickly through these tax incentives.\n\nHowever, specific rules about limits, phase-outs, and eligibility criteria can change, so it's crucial for businesses considering investing in solar panels or other renewable energy sources to consult with a tax professional. This ensures they fully understand the current tax implications, how to maximize potential tax benefits, and comply with all IRS requirements.\n\nGiven the details provided about Section 179 and bonus depreciation changes, it is advisable to review the latest IRS guidelines or consult with a tax advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date advice regarding the tax treatment of solar panel installations for your business."
