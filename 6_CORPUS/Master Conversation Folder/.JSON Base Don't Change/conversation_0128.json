            "Father Henry,\n\nOur apologies for the lack of communication. We will get to that in a moment. First, I\u2019m going to be forthright from the beginning and let you know that we will not be able to proceed forth with your project. \n\nUpon our engineering review, we found significant issues as it directly related to our ability to install the solar project as all parties agreed to, and at the build costs we estimated for. GIven the detail of issues to be addressed, accurate pricing without significant Change Orders would be impossible. This type of development is not feasible with our current investor relationship.\n\nSome of the issues for reference:\n\n- Required voltage step up from 208v to 480v. This requires significantly more gear and requirement of space, which the current electrical room setup did not support. Meeting permitting access guidelines would be nearly impossible. More importantly,  the existing electrical room size and space requirements may not have been up to code, or would be up to the discretion of an inspector. We attempted to have an inspector come on site to review, but they would not. Without that understanding, we would own any and all out of code electrical issues past and present, something we were simply not comfortable to risk. This was the greatest concern, and had significant financial risk/burden that we were not willing to incur.\n\n- After structural engineering review, we found different support structures that would require several different roof attachments. Cost and labor was not foreseen and would have needed to be accounted for.\n\n- Switchgear for terminating connections had space issues and we were not confident it was possible. This would only be known upon inspection. If not acceptable via the inspector, we would not pass and would not have an alternate solution. Essentially this would be unknown until after installation, with no remedy.\n\n- The requirement of custom troughs and space constraints was another unknown, with feasibility not entirely known due to space constraints.\n\nWhile these issues could be overcome, it would be based in hope, not fact. Without fact based evidence, we are simply not willing to take the risk. \n\nWe take great pride in collaborating with churches and nonprofits like yourselves to bring solar solutions to such a valued piece of our community.  We spent almost 2 years bringing this project to life, and we certainly did not make this decision without ample internal/external discussion and review. This took time and careful review. Lumina, DSD and outside consulting all had ample time. While sometimes necessary, this is never an easy decision to inform our clients.\n\nAs for the lack of communication. As a company built on integrity, we felt you should know this decision was made in late February. There was internal confusion between Lumina and DSD that led to the delay in relaying this information to you. The details do not matter, what matters is we lacked the proper chain of dialogue and follow up with each other. Neither party confirmed or verified that the information had been passed along. Both had assumed the other informed you. For that we sincerely apologize and have addressed as a company moving forward.\n\n We appreciate the opportunity you and your congregation have provided us. Should you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out."

            "Here is a potential reply to the company from Father Henry:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Re: Project Cancellation Notification\n\nDear [Company Representative],\n\nThank you for your detailed communication regarding the cancellation of the solar project at our church. I appreciate your forthrightness in explaining the complexities and challenges that led to this decision. \n\nWhile we are disappointed that the project cannot proceed as planned, we understand the technical and regulatory hurdles you outlined. The issues such as voltage step-up requirements, space constraints in the electrical room, and structural concerns are indeed significant, and it is clear that these would pose a risk too great for both our organizations without guaranteed solutions.\n\nWe are also mindful of the importance of adhering to code and safety standards, and it seems that pushing forward without certainty on these fronts would not be prudent. The financial implications and potential for unforeseen costs are concerns that we take very seriously, and thus we concur with your decision to halt the project.\n\nRegarding the communication delays, we appreciate your candor in acknowledging these and the measures you've taken to improve internal processes. We value transparency and understand that such situations can arise in any organization.\n\nPlease extend our gratitude to everyone at Lumina, DSD, and the consulting teams who dedicated time and effort to this initiative. We hold no ill feelings and look forward to potential future collaborations that may be more feasible.\n\nShould any new possibilities or solutions arise that could address these challenges, or if there is another way we might work together under different circumstances, please do keep us informed.\n\nThank you once again for your efforts and for your clear communication. We wish your team continued success in your projects and endeavors.\n\nKind regards,\n\nFather Henry  \n[Church Name]  \n[Contact Information]  \n\n--- \n\nThis response maintains a positive tone, acknowledges the complexities faced by the project, and keeps the door open for future collaboration."

            "Subject: Important Update on the Solar Project\n\nDear Father Henry,\n\nWe extend our sincere apologies for the delayed communication; the nuances of this situation will be elaborated shortly. Initially, I must candidly disclose that, following extensive deliberations and technical evaluations, we find ourselves unable to continue with the solar project as previously envisioned.\n\nIn the course of our detailed engineering assessment, we encountered several substantial barriers that fundamentally challenge the project\u2019s viability at the predetermined financial estimates. These challenges render the project infeasible within the framework of our current investment parameters.\n\nKey issues identified include:\n\n1. **Voltage Adaptation Requirements:** The project necessitates an elevation from 208v to 480v, which demands additional equipment and spatial allowances that our current setup cannot support. The constraints of the existing electrical infrastructure, coupled with stringent permitting guidelines, present nearly insurmountable challenges. Moreover, potential code compliance uncertainties, which remained unverified due to the absence of an inspector's review, pose a significant risk that we cannot prudently accept.\n\n2. **Structural Integration:** Post-review by our structural engineers, it became apparent that the installation would require diverse roofing modifications not previously accounted for, thus unexpectedly escalating costs and labor.\n\n3. **Connection Termination Concerns:** Issues related to the spatial adequacy for switchgear installation surfaced, with feasibility remaining indeterminate pending official inspection. This introduces an element of unpredictability that could ultimately prevent project compliance.\n\n4. **Custom Installations:** The necessity for tailored troughs amidst spatial limitations further complicates the project, with their practicality still in question.\n\nAlthough theoretically surmountable, these issues would require resolutions founded more on hope than on empirical evidence. Without concrete data to support further action, the risks involved are too substantial for us to undertake.\n\nOur commitment to collaborating with community institutions like yours remains unwavering, and it is with deep regret that we reach this conclusion after nearly two years of concerted effort and analysis involving both our internal teams and external consultants from Lumina, DSD, and others. Decisions of this nature are profound and never made lightly.\n\nRegarding our communication shortfall, please understand that an internal misalignment between Lumina and DSD during late February contributed to this oversight. It was a lapse in the robust dialogue we strive to maintain, for which we have implemented corrective measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nWe are profoundly grateful for the trust and opportunity you and your congregation extended to us. Should you wish to discuss this further or explore potential alternatives, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Company Name]  \n[Contact Information]  \n\n---\n\nThis version of the email uses more formal language and structure to convey the same points more eloquently and professionally."
