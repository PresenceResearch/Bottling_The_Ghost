Passengers boarding at these stations should arrive at least 10 minutes early.\n\n(R) - ONLY trains designated with an R at the top of the column will operate when limited service conditions or special circumstances warrant. On days of heavy snowfall or other severe weather, MARC will operate this special schedule. Additional stops marked with an R will be made when this schedule is in effect. See the \u301073\u2020PDF schedule\u3011 for complete R schedule details.\n\n(R+) - Train will operate or add additional stops when the R+ schedule is operated, in addition to trains with an R at the top of the column.\n\n(C) - Connecting bus operated by Eastern Panhandle Transit Authority (EPTA). You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. \u301075\u2020Click here for more details\u3011.\n\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * \u301078\u2020MDOT MTA\u2020www.mdot.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n\n  * \u301079\u2020Maryland.gov\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Phone Directory\u2020www.doit.state.md.us\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020State Agencies\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Online Services\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n\u301080\u20201-888-373-7888\u2020tel:1-888-373-7888\u3011 \u301081\u2020 233733\u2020tel:233733\u3011 \u301082\u2020 More Information on human trafficking in Maryland\u2020goccp.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Customer Service Promise\n\nThe State of Maryland pledges to provide constituents, businesses, customers, and stakeholders with friendly and courteous, timely and responsive, accurate and consistent, accessible and convenient, and truthful and transparent services.\n\n\u301083\u2020Take Our Survey\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Help Stop Fraud in State Government\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits operates a toll-free fraud hotline to receive allegations of fraud and/or abuse of State government resources.

Passengers boarding at these stations should arrive at least 10 minutes early.\n\n(R) - ONLY trains designated with an R at the top of the column will operate when limited service conditions or special circumstances warrant. On days of heavy snowfall or other severe weather, MARC will operate this special schedule. Additional stops marked with an R will be made when this schedule is in effect. See the \u301073\u2020PDF schedule\u3011 for complete R schedule details.\n\n(R+) - Train will operate or add additional stops when the R+ schedule is operated, in addition to trains with an R at the top of the column.\n\n(C) - Connecting bus operated by Eastern Panhandle Transit Authority (EPTA). You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. \u301075\u2020Click here for more details\u3011.\n\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * \u301078\u2020MDOT MTA\u2020www.mdot.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n\n  * \u301079\u2020Maryland.gov\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Phone Directory\u2020www.doit.state.md.us\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020State Agencies\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Online Services\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n\u301080\u20201-888-373-7888\u2020tel:1-888-373-7888\u3011 \u301081\u2020 233733\u2020tel:233733\u3011 \u301082\u2020 More Information on human trafficking in Maryland\u2020goccp.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Customer Service Promise\n\nThe State of Maryland pledges to provide constituents, businesses, customers, and stakeholders with friendly and courteous, timely and responsive, accurate and consistent, accessible and convenient, and truthful and transparent services.\n\n\u301083\u2020Take Our Survey\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Help Stop Fraud in State Government\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits operates a toll-free fraud hotline to receive allegations of fraud and/or abuse of State government resources.

Passengers boarding at these stations should arrive at least 10 minutes early.\n\n(R) - ONLY trains designated with an R at the top of the column will operate when limited service conditions or special circumstances warrant. On days of heavy snowfall or other severe weather, MARC will operate this special schedule. Additional stops marked with an R will be made when this schedule is in effect. See the \u301073\u2020PDF schedule\u3011 for complete R schedule details.\n\n(R+) - Train will operate or add additional stops when the R+ schedule is operated, in addition to trains with an R at the top of the column.\n\n(C) - Connecting bus operated by Eastern Panhandle Transit Authority (EPTA). You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. \u301075\u2020Click here for more details\u3011.\n\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * \u301078\u2020MDOT MTA\u2020www.mdot.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n\n  * \u301079\u2020Maryland.gov\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Phone Directory\u2020www.doit.state.md.us\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020State Agencies\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Online Services\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n\u301080\u20201-888-373-7888\u2020tel:1-888-373-7888\u3011 \u301081\u2020 233733\u2020tel:233733\u3011 \u301082\u2020 More Information on human trafficking in Maryland\u2020goccp.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Customer Service Promise\n\nThe State of Maryland pledges to provide constituents, businesses, customers, and stakeholders with friendly and courteous, timely and responsive, accurate and consistent, accessible and convenient, and truthful and transparent services.\n\n\u301083\u2020Take Our Survey\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Help Stop Fraud in State Government\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits operates a toll-free fraud hotline to receive allegations of fraud and/or abuse of State government resources.

Passengers boarding at these stations should arrive at least 10 minutes early.\n\n(R) - ONLY trains designated with an R at the top of the column will operate when limited service conditions or special circumstances warrant. On days of heavy snowfall or other severe weather, MARC will operate this special schedule. Additional stops marked with an R will be made when this schedule is in effect. See the \u301073\u2020PDF schedule\u3011 for complete R schedule details.\n\n(R+) - Train will operate or add additional stops when the R+ schedule is operated, in addition to trains with an R at the top of the column.\n\n(C) - Connecting bus operated by Eastern Panhandle Transit Authority (EPTA). You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. \u301075\u2020Click here for more details\u3011.\n\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * \u301078\u2020MDOT MTA\u2020www.mdot.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Careers\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Accessibility / ADA\u3011\n  * \u301076\u2020Title VI\u3011\n\n  * \u301079\u2020Maryland.gov\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Phone Directory\u2020www.doit.state.md.us\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020State Agencies\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Online Services\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * \u30105\u2020MTA Facebook link\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020MTA Twitter link\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020MTA Instagram link\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020MTA YouTube link\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020MTA LinkedIn link\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301070\u2020Contact MTA\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Terms & Conditions\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n\u301080\u20201-888-373-7888\u2020tel:1-888-373-7888\u3011 \u301081\u2020 233733\u2020tel:233733\u3011 \u301082\u2020 More Information on human trafficking in Maryland\u2020goccp.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Customer Service Promise\n\nThe State of Maryland pledges to provide constituents, businesses, customers, and stakeholders with friendly and courteous, timely and responsive, accurate and consistent, accessible and convenient, and truthful and transparent services.\n\n\u301083\u2020Take Our Survey\u2020www.maryland.gov\u3011\n\n## Help Stop Fraud in State Government\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits operates a toll-free fraud hotline to receive allegations of fraud and/or abuse of State government resources.
