            "Analyzing PEPCO commercial electricity prices in the District of Columbia over the last 15 years shows a trend of periodic increases and adjustments reflective of market conditions and regulatory decisions. Historical data from the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) reveals that Pepco's Standard Offer Service (SOS) rates for electricity have seen fluctuations, with a mix of rate hikes and reductions over this period. Notably, Pepco announced significant price increases for 2023-2024, with commercial customers expected to see their rates jump by at least 66% compared to the previous year\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFuture projections for the next ten years indicate that commercial electricity rates will likely continue to rise. The DCPSC has approved a multi-year rate plan for Pepco, authorizing the utility to recover $108.6 million through higher rates, translating to continued increases in electricity costs for consumers\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn terms of approved rate increases over the next few years, the DCPSC has already sanctioned a structured increase in Pepco's rates. These adjustments are part of a broader plan to enhance service reliability and fund critical infrastructure projects. For instance, there are planned average monthly increases of $3.66 in 2022 and another $1.54 in 2023\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFor a detailed and up-to-date understanding of current and future electricity rates, it is advisable to refer to the DCPSC's official releases and Pepco's announcements, as they provide comprehensive insights into approved rate changes and the factors influencing them."

Consumers will likely see a significant increase on their monthly bill after this date. An average residential customer\u2019s bill is projected to increase by 8%, or $8.12 per month.  \n\nEligible District residents can apply to several assistance or discount programs to help lower their utility costs and get \u301077\u2020tips for preparing their homes for high temperatures and summer storms\u3011. \n\n\u301053\u2020Utility discount programs, bill credits, and other assistance\u3011\n\nPlease \u301078\u2020contact the DCPSC\u3011 if you have any questions or need additional assistance.\n\nWhat is a Standard Offer Service (SOS) electricity rate?  \nStandard Offer Service, commonly referred to as SOS, is the \u201cdefault\u201d electricity supply service sold by electric utility companies to a utility customer who does not choose an \u301079\u2020alternative electricity supplier\u2020dcpowerconnect.com\u3011. In the District, Pepco is the SOS administrator and purchases electricity and sells it to consumers at an approved rate. The SOS program is administered under rules established by the Commission.  \n\nPepco and other SOS administrators purchase electricity during annual wholesale auctions. Several wholesale electricity suppliers place competitive bids to try to win contracts to supply electricity to an electric utility. The electric utility awards the contract to the wholesale supplier who made the lowest bid. Pepco \u301080\u2020states\u2020www.pepco.com\u3011 that these annual competitive auctions \u201cprovide customers with generation rates that are reflective of market conditions while at the same time providing protection against extreme conditions.\u201d  \n\nIn the District, SOS rates have decreased from the previous year 50% of the time since 2006.  \n\nUnderstand your electricity bill  \nMost energy customers only look at their energy bill to find out what they need to pay each month.

The utility said the increases at that level would help pay to improve service and for other capital projects, like substations and replacing lines and poles across Maryland. \n\n## \u301055\u2020Reading up on the candidates before you vote?

Richard agreed that some increase should be permitted and voted yes to the lower amount. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nBut they said Pepco should have done a better job in forecasting its future costs associated with improvements to its service and other capital projects. \n\n## \u301024\u2020Want more political and government news? Subscribe to MoCo360 Politics Briefing.\u3011\n\nCommissioner Anthony J. O\u2019Donnell was the third vote to approve the increase. \n\nCommissioners Odogwu Obi Linton and Mindy L. Herman voted no. They said their concerns about Pepco\u2019s forecasts and overall transparency during the process meant they couldn\u2019t support a large increase in utility rates. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe Maryland Office of People\u2019s Counsel, which represents residential customers in Public Service Commission cases, agreed with Linton and Herman. \n\nArmstrong said Pepco officials are still reviewing the PSC\u2019s order, but much of the rate increases \u201care going right back into the system,\u201d which has improved in overall reliability over roughly the last decade. The utility is still determining which projects to consider since the full request wasn\u2019t funded, he said. \n\nThe Office of People\u2019s Counsel said in a press release that the PSC \u201cdenied accelerated recovery of several high-price distribution substation projects, totaling more than $56 million.\u201d \n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe PSC also denied Pepco\u2019s streetlight conversion project, according to the Office of People\u2019s Counsel. \n\nDuring the past 10 years, \u201congoing investments in the local energy grid have driven a 68 percent decrease in the frequency of electric outages Pepco customers have experienced\u201d across Maryland and Washington, D",

The utility said the increases at that level would help pay to improve service and for other capital projects, like substations and replacing lines and poles across Maryland. \n\n## \u301055\u2020Reading up on the candidates before you vote?

Richard agreed that some increase should be permitted and voted yes to the lower amount. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nBut they said Pepco should have done a better job in forecasting its future costs associated with improvements to its service and other capital projects. \n\n## \u301024\u2020Want more political and government news? Subscribe to MoCo360 Politics Briefing.\u3011\n\nCommissioner Anthony J. O\u2019Donnell was the third vote to approve the increase. \n\nCommissioners Odogwu Obi Linton and Mindy L. Herman voted no. They said their concerns about Pepco\u2019s forecasts and overall transparency during the process meant they couldn\u2019t support a large increase in utility rates. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe Maryland Office of People\u2019s Counsel, which represents residential customers in Public Service Commission cases, agreed with Linton and Herman. \n\nArmstrong said Pepco officials are still reviewing the PSC\u2019s order, but much of the rate increases \u201care going right back into the system,\u201d which has improved in overall reliability over roughly the last decade. The utility is still determining which projects to consider since the full request wasn\u2019t funded, he said. \n\nThe Office of People\u2019s Counsel said in a press release that the PSC \u201cdenied accelerated recovery of several high-price distribution substation projects, totaling more than $56 million.\u201d \n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe PSC also denied Pepco\u2019s streetlight conversion project, according to the Office of People\u2019s Counsel. \n\nDuring the past 10 years, \u201congoing investments in the local energy grid have driven a 68 percent decrease in the frequency of electric outages Pepco customers have experienced\u201d across Maryland and Washington, D",

In the District, Pepco is the SOS administrator and purchases electricity and sells it to consumers at an approved rate. The SOS program is administered under rules established by the Commission.  \n\nPepco and other SOS administrators purchase electricity during annual wholesale auctions. Several wholesale electricity suppliers place competitive bids to try to win contracts to supply electricity to an electric utility. The electric utility awards the contract to the wholesale supplier who made the lowest bid. Pepco \u301080\u2020states\u2020www.pepco.com\u3011 that these annual competitive auctions \u201cprovide customers with generation rates that are reflective of market conditions while at the same time providing protection against extreme conditions.\u201d  \n\nIn the District, SOS rates have decreased from the previous year 50% of the time since 2006.  \n\nUnderstand your electricity bill  \nMost energy customers only look at their energy bill to find out what they need to pay each month.
