          "text": "\n## The campsite I reserved says it accepts an RV or trailer length that's shorter than the length of my RV or trailer. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRV and trailer length listed for each campsite indicate the maximum length of an RV and/or trailer the campsite can easily accommodate. In many cases, the maximum lengths for RVs and trailers are different because the campsites are not pull-through sites. Factors limiting RV/trailer length include access roads into some campgrounds and the turning radius required to maneuver into the site. In any case, if you reserve a campsite for an RV or trailer that is longer than specified for the campsite and can park all of your RV's or trailer's wheels onto the parking pad without obstructing traffic, you can use the campsite. However, we do not recommend taking this risk. If you're unable to get your RV or trailer into the campsite, we won't be able to find another campsite for you. You can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation if you have questions about a specific campsite. Please read the site alerts carefully, and realize that the lengths allowable are almost always different depending on if you are in a RV or a trailer (trailer maneuverability limits trailer length).\n\n## I made a reservation for an RV nonelectric campsite but only have a tent. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nSome campsites are listed on recreation.gov as \"RV nonelectric.\" This means the campsite is best suited for RVs and trailers. While you aren't required to use an RV in one of these campsites, they are listed as RV only because they generally do not have adequate or level space to pitch a tent. If you arrive and find that the campsite doesn't work for you and/or your tent, we will not be able to move you to a different campsite. You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you have questions about a specific campsite, you can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation.\n\n## I made a reservation for a tent-only nonelectric campsite but have an RV or other vehicle I sleep in. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRVs are not allowed in tent-only campsites. These sites only have space for tents and, in many cases, the parking is a short distance away from the campsite (and you're required to camp in the campsite). You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you arrive with different equipment than allowed in the site you reserved, we will not be able to accommodate you.\n\n## I made a reservation for a standard nonelectric campsite. What does this mean?\n\nMost reservable campsites in Yosemite are listed on recreation.gov as \"standard nonelectric.\" These campsites are suitable for both tents and RVs (or a combination of both). But be sure to read the site alerts and book a site that will accommodate your specific equipment. Many large RVs and trailers will not fit into many standard campsites.\n\n## In May and June, why are so many campsites in North Pines and Lower Pines not available for reservation?\n\nSpring floods are common in Yosemite Valley in May and June, with portions of Lower Pines, and, especially, North Pines Campgrounds becoming inundated. As a result, we don't make the affected campsites available for reservation until we are sure the river will be at a safe level. Depending on conditions, these campsites may be available for reservation a few weeks (less likely) or just a few days (more likely) in advance via recreation.gov. If water levels are high, these sites may only be available in the park on a first-come, first-served, daily basis.\n\n## We have more than two vehicles arriving at our campsite. Where can we park the additional vehicles?\n\nA maximum of two motor vehicles are allowed per campsite. All vehicles must be parked on a parking pad. Trailers don't count against the vehicle limit as long as they fit on the parking pad. Additional parking is available near each campground for no additional charge; for some campgrounds additional parking is very limited.\n\n## When can I check in? Can I check in after hours? What if I'm late?\n\nCheckin (and checkout) time is noon on your arrival date. If you arrive after the ranger has left the campground, proceed directly to the campsite indicated on your reservation. (At Tuolumne Meadows Campground, check the kiosk to find out which campsite you're assigned to.) You must check in at the campground kiosk or the reservation office the next morning to ensure we know you're here. If you plan to arrive later than the arrival date on your reservation, please call the campground office number listed on your reservation paperwork. If we don't hear from you by noon after the first night on your reservation, and you have not checked in, you will forfeit your entire reservation. The person whose name is on the reservation must check in with valid photo identification.\n\n## How can I cancel or change my reservation?\n\nCall 877/444-6777 to change or cancel your reservation. You can also log in to \u301018\u2020recreation.gov\u2020www.recreation.gov\u3011 to cancel your reservation.  \n\nLast updated: September 13, 2023\n\n## Park footer\n\n### Contact Info\n\n#### Phone:\n\n209",

A $10 service fee will be withheld from any refund for a cancellation. Depending on when you cancel in relation to your arrival day, it may be considered a late cancellation (see below). \n\n## Changing an Existing Reservation: When changes are made prior to the cut-off window:\n\n  * If a customer wants to switch dates that are entirely outside of the original reservation dates, there is a $10 change fee.\n  * There is no change fee if a customer extends or shortens a reservation, as long as the change includes dates from the original reservation. If they choose to depart early, they may forfeit the recreation fee for the day of departure. \n  * There is no change fee if the customer wants to switch sites that are the same price with the same reservation dates in the same facility. \n  * If a reservation is made that includes dates beyond the maximum booking window, that reservation cannot be changed until 18 days have passed from the original booking date. \n\n## Late Cancellations or Cancellations within the Cut-off Window\n\n  * Individual Campsites: A customer who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee (not to exceed the total paid for the original reservation). Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee. \n  * Cabins / Lookouts: Customers who cancel a cabin or lookout reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee. \n  * Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): Customers who cancel a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee. \n  * Group Day Use Area: Customers who cancel a group day-use facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will  forfeit the total day-use fee. \n  * Changes or Cancellations within the Cut-off Window: Once a reservation date has begun, customers cannot change a reservation using the online system or through the Call Center (see below for early departures). If the location is staffed, on-site personnel may or may not be able to assist with changes or cancellations (check with local staff). \n\n## No-Shows\n\n  * Overnight and Day-Use Facilities: A no-show customer is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date (or for day-use facilities, by check-in time the day of arrival). Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date and will hold group day-use facilities until check-in time on the arrival date. \n  * No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night\u2019s recreation fee for a campsite or forfeit the entire day-use fee for a day-use facility. \n\n## Early Departures\n\n  * If a customer departs prior to the scheduled check-out date, they may be eligible for a partial refund.\n  * Please notify staff at the facility if you depart early to allow others to use the site.\n  * Customers may notify the call center to request a refund of remaining unused nights. If a customer requests a refund for an early departure after the facility check-out time has passed, the customer will not be refunded for that night and is eligible for a refund on any additional nights that will not be used. \n\n## Interagency Pass Discounts\n\n  * The following are the only Interagency Passes that provide a discount on camping reservations and some tickets: \n    * Senior Annual Pass\n    * Senior Lifetime Pass\n    * Access Pass\n    * Golden Age Pass\n    * Golden Access Pass\n  * Eligible pass discounts only apply to individual campsites and may apply to a ticket for the pass holder. Interagency Pass discounts do not apply to group reservations, cabins, shelters, and multi-use sites (doubles, triples, etc.). \n  * Pass discounts only apply to the recreation (or use) fee for the facility. Other charges such as electricity or water hookups, reservation or other fees are not eligible for a discount. \n  * The holder of the pass must occupy the site for which the discount is applied.\n  * The pass can only be used for one site during a time period.\n\n## Refunds \n\nCustomers may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Customers may also initiate a refund request through the call center at any time after their reservation has ended.\n\n  * Fees: Applicable fees, such as reservation fees, service/cancellation fees, lottery application fees, and change fees, are non-refundable. \n  * Debit or Credit Card Purchases: Refunds for debit or credit card payments made after October 1, 2018 will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay. In the event that a customer has cancelled this card, they will need to contact their card company to have the funds released. We cannot issue refunds to any card other than the one used to pay. If a customer paid with a debit or credit card prior to October 1, 2018 their refund will be issued in the form of a Treasury check. \n  * Check or Cash Purchases: Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation.

            "In the context of National Park Service (NPS) reservations, a \"transferred reservation\" typically refers to situations where a reservation can be modified or transferred to a different set of dates or campsites within the same facility, rather than being canceled outright. However, there are restrictions; such modifications must be done before the cut-off window, and there are sometimes change fees associated with it. Additionally, many NPS reservations are not transferable to other individuals, meaning the person who made the reservation must be the one to use it\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIf you need to adjust the reservation, it is often handled through the Recreation.gov platform, where users can modify dates or locations, but these changes depend on availability and specific rules of the park."

                "text": "\n## The campsite I reserved says it accepts an RV or trailer length that's shorter than the length of my RV or trailer. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRV and trailer length listed for each campsite indicate the maximum length of an RV and/or trailer the campsite can easily accommodate. In many cases, the maximum lengths for RVs and trailers are different because the campsites are not pull-through sites. Factors limiting RV/trailer length include access roads into some campgrounds and the turning radius required to maneuver into the site. In any case, if you reserve a campsite for an RV or trailer that is longer than specified for the campsite and can park all of your RV's or trailer's wheels onto the parking pad without obstructing traffic, you can use the campsite. However, we do not recommend taking this risk. If you're unable to get your RV or trailer into the campsite, we won't be able to find another campsite for you. You can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation if you have questions about a specific campsite. Please read the site alerts carefully, and realize that the lengths allowable are almost always different depending on if you are in a RV or a trailer (trailer maneuverability limits trailer length).\n\n## I made a reservation for an RV nonelectric campsite but only have a tent. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nSome campsites are listed on recreation.gov as \"RV nonelectric.\" This means the campsite is best suited for RVs and trailers. While you aren't required to use an RV in one of these campsites, they are listed as RV only because they generally do not have adequate or level space to pitch a tent. If you arrive and find that the campsite doesn't work for you and/or your tent, we will not be able to move you to a different campsite. You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you have questions about a specific campsite, you can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation.\n\n## I made a reservation for a tent-only nonelectric campsite but have an RV or other vehicle I sleep in. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRVs are not allowed in tent-only campsites. These sites only have space for tents and, in many cases, the parking is a short distance away from the campsite (and you're required to camp in the campsite). You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you arrive with different equipment than allowed in the site you reserved, we will not be able to accommodate you.\n\n## I made a reservation for a standard nonelectric campsite. What does this mean?\n\nMost reservable campsites in Yosemite are listed on recreation.gov as \"standard nonelectric.\" These campsites are suitable for both tents and RVs (or a combination of both). But be sure to read the site alerts and book a site that will accommodate your specific equipment. Many large RVs and trailers will not fit into many standard campsites.\n\n## In May and June, why are so many campsites in North Pines and Lower Pines not available for reservation?\n\nSpring floods are common in Yosemite Valley in May and June, with portions of Lower Pines, and, especially, North Pines Campgrounds becoming inundated. As a result, we don't make the affected campsites available for reservation until we are sure the river will be at a safe level. Depending on conditions, these campsites may be available for reservation a few weeks (less likely) or just a few days (more likely) in advance via recreation.gov. If water levels are high, these sites may only be available in the park on a first-come, first-served, daily basis.\n\n## We have more than two vehicles arriving at our campsite. Where can we park the additional vehicles?\n\nA maximum of two motor vehicles are allowed per campsite. All vehicles must be parked on a parking pad. Trailers don't count against the vehicle limit as long as they fit on the parking pad. Additional parking is available near each campground for no additional charge; for some campgrounds additional parking is very limited.\n\n## When can I check in? Can I check in after hours? What if I'm late?\n\nCheckin (and checkout) time is noon on your arrival date. If you arrive after the ranger has left the campground, proceed directly to the campsite indicated on your reservation. (At Tuolumne Meadows Campground, check the kiosk to find out which campsite you're assigned to.) You must check in at the campground kiosk or the reservation office the next morning to ensure we know you're here. If you plan to arrive later than the arrival date on your reservation, please call the campground office number listed on your reservation paperwork. If we don't hear from you by noon after the first night on your reservation, and you have not checked in, you will forfeit your entire reservation. The person whose name is on the reservation must check in with valid photo identification.\n\n## How can I cancel or change my reservation?\n\nCall 877/444-6777 to change or cancel your reservation. You can also log in to \u301018\u2020recreation.gov\u2020www.recreation.gov\u3011 to cancel your reservation.  \n\nLast updated: September 13, 2023\n\n## Park footer\n\n### Contact Info\n\n#### Phone:\n\n209",

              "snippet": "\n## The campsite I reserved says it accepts an RV or trailer length that's shorter than the length of my RV or trailer. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRV and trailer length listed for each campsite indicate the maximum length of an RV and/or trailer the campsite can easily accommodate. In many cases, the maximum lengths for RVs and trailers are different because the campsites are not pull-through sites. Factors limiting RV/trailer length include access roads into some campgrounds and the turning radius required to maneuver into the site. In any case, if you reserve a campsite for an RV or trailer that is longer than specified for the campsite and can park all of your RV's or trailer's wheels onto the parking pad without obstructing traffic, you can use the campsite. However, we do not recommend taking this risk. If you're unable to get your RV or trailer into the campsite, we won't be able to find another campsite for you. You can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation if you have questions about a specific campsite. Please read the site alerts carefully, and realize that the lengths allowable are almost always different depending on if you are in a RV or a trailer (trailer maneuverability limits trailer length).\n\n## I made a reservation for an RV nonelectric campsite but only have a tent.

            "In the context of real estate, particularly involving National Park Service (NPS) properties or federally controlled lands, a \"transferred reservation\" generally refers to the legal transfer of the use or ownership rights of a specific parcel of land from one entity to another. This often occurs under programs such as the Federal Lands to Parks (FLP) program, where the NPS may transfer surplus federal real estate to local governments or other agencies for public use, typically as parks or recreational areas.\n\nThe transfer often includes restrictions or covenants that ensure the land is used for its intended public purpose in perpetuity. This can involve specific legal agreements to preserve the land's conservation or historic value. Such transferred reservations are not sold but transferred under strict conditions that bind the new owners to continue using the land for the public benefit\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30108\u2020source\u3011."

                "url": "https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campingfaq.htm",
                "text": "\n## The campsite I reserved says it accepts an RV or trailer length that's shorter than the length of my RV or trailer. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRV and trailer length listed for each campsite indicate the maximum length of an RV and/or trailer the campsite can easily accommodate. In many cases, the maximum lengths for RVs and trailers are different because the campsites are not pull-through sites. Factors limiting RV/trailer length include access roads into some campgrounds and the turning radius required to maneuver into the site. In any case, if you reserve a campsite for an RV or trailer that is longer than specified for the campsite and can park all of your RV's or trailer's wheels onto the parking pad without obstructing traffic, you can use the campsite. However, we do not recommend taking this risk. If you're unable to get your RV or trailer into the campsite, we won't be able to find another campsite for you. You can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation if you have questions about a specific campsite. Please read the site alerts carefully, and realize that the lengths allowable are almost always different depending on if you are in a RV or a trailer (trailer maneuverability limits trailer length).\n\n## I made a reservation for an RV nonelectric campsite but only have a tent. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nSome campsites are listed on recreation.gov as \"RV nonelectric.\" This means the campsite is best suited for RVs and trailers. While you aren't required to use an RV in one of these campsites, they are listed as RV only because they generally do not have adequate or level space to pitch a tent. If you arrive and find that the campsite doesn't work for you and/or your tent, we will not be able to move you to a different campsite. You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you have questions about a specific campsite, you can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation.\n\n## I made a reservation for a tent-only nonelectric campsite but have an RV or other vehicle I sleep in. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRVs are not allowed in tent-only campsites. These sites only have space for tents and, in many cases, the parking is a short distance away from the campsite (and you're required to camp in the campsite). You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you arrive with different equipment than allowed in the site you reserved, we will not be able to accommodate you.\n\n## I made a reservation for a standard nonelectric campsite. What does this mean?\n\nMost reservable campsites in Yosemite are listed on recreation.gov as \"standard nonelectric.\" These campsites are suitable for both tents and RVs (or a combination of both). But be sure to read the site alerts and book a site that will accommodate your specific equipment. Many large RVs and trailers will not fit into many standard campsites.\n\n## In May and June, why are so many campsites in North Pines and Lower Pines not available for reservation?\n\nSpring floods are common in Yosemite Valley in May and June, with portions of Lower Pines, and, especially, North Pines Campgrounds becoming inundated. As a result, we don't make the affected campsites available for reservation until we are sure the river will be at a safe level. Depending on conditions, these campsites may be available for reservation a few weeks (less likely) or just a few days (more likely) in advance via recreation.gov. If water levels are high, these sites may only be available in the park on a first-come, first-served, daily basis.\n\n## We have more than two vehicles arriving at our campsite. Where can we park the additional vehicles?\n\nA maximum of two motor vehicles are allowed per campsite. All vehicles must be parked on a parking pad. Trailers don't count against the vehicle limit as long as they fit on the parking pad. Additional parking is available near each campground for no additional charge; for some campgrounds additional parking is very limited.\n\n## When can I check in? Can I check in after hours? What if I'm late?\n\nCheckin (and checkout) time is noon on your arrival date. If you arrive after the ranger has left the campground, proceed directly to the campsite indicated on your reservation. (At Tuolumne Meadows Campground, check the kiosk to find out which campsite you're assigned to.) You must check in at the campground kiosk or the reservation office the next morning to ensure we know you're here. If you plan to arrive later than the arrival date on your reservation, please call the campground office number listed on your reservation paperwork. If we don't hear from you by noon after the first night on your reservation, and you have not checked in, you will forfeit your entire reservation.

              "snippet": "\n## The campsite I reserved says it accepts an RV or trailer length that's shorter than the length of my RV or trailer. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRV and trailer length listed for each campsite indicate the maximum length of an RV and/or trailer the campsite can easily accommodate. In many cases, the maximum lengths for RVs and trailers are different because the campsites are not pull-through sites. Factors limiting RV/trailer length include access roads into some campgrounds and the turning radius required to maneuver into the site. In any case, if you reserve a campsite for an RV or trailer that is longer than specified for the campsite and can park all of your RV's or trailer's wheels onto the parking pad without obstructing traffic, you can use the campsite. However, we do not recommend taking this risk. If you're unable to get your RV or trailer into the campsite, we won't be able to find another campsite for you. You can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation if you have questions about a specific campsite. Please read the site alerts carefully, and realize that the lengths allowable are almost always different depending on if you are in a RV or a trailer (trailer maneuverability limits trailer length).\n\n## I made a reservation for an RV nonelectric campsite but only have a tent. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nSome campsites are listed on recreation.gov as \"RV nonelectric.\" This means the campsite is best suited for RVs and trailers. While you aren't required to use an RV in one of these campsites, they are listed as RV only because they generally do not have adequate or level space to pitch a tent. If you arrive and find that the campsite doesn't work for you and/or your tent, we will not be able to move you to a different campsite. You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you have questions about a specific campsite, you can call the campground office at the phone number listed in your reservation.\n\n## I made a reservation for a tent-only nonelectric campsite but have an RV or other vehicle I sleep in. Can I still use the campsite?\n\nRVs are not allowed in tent-only campsites. These sites only have space for tents and, in many cases, the parking is a short distance away from the campsite (and you're required to camp in the campsite). You should always read the site alerts and book a site that is appropriate for the equipment you will be camping in. If you arrive with different equipment than allowed in the site you reserved, we will not be able to accommodate you.\n\n## I made a reservation for a standard nonelectric campsite. What does this mean?\n\nMost reservable campsites in Yosemite are listed on recreation.gov as \"standard nonelectric.\" These campsites are suitable for both tents and RVs (or a combination of both). But be sure to read the site alerts and book a site that will accommodate your specific equipment. Many large RVs and trailers will not fit into many standard campsites.\n\n## In May and June, why are so many campsites in North Pines and Lower Pines not available for reservation?\n\nSpring floods are common in Yosemite Valley in May and June, with portions of Lower Pines, and, especially, North Pines Campgrounds becoming inundated. As a result, we don't make the affected campsites available for reservation until we are sure the river will be at a safe level. Depending on conditions, these campsites may be available for reservation a few weeks (less likely) or just a few days (more likely) in advance via recreation.gov. If water levels are high, these sites may only be available in the park on a first-come, first-served, daily basis.\n\n## We have more than two vehicles arriving at our campsite. Where can we park the additional vehicles?\n\nA maximum of two motor vehicles are allowed per campsite. All vehicles must be parked on a parking pad. Trailers don't count against the vehicle limit as long as they fit on the parking pad. Additional parking is available near each campground for no additional charge; for some campgrounds additional parking is very limited.\n\n## When can I check in? Can I check in after hours? What if I'm late?\n\nCheckin (and checkout) time is noon on your arrival date. If you arrive after the ranger has left the campground, proceed directly to the campsite indicated on your reservation. (At Tuolumne Meadows Campground, check the kiosk to find out which campsite you're assigned to.) You must check in at the campground kiosk or the reservation office the next morning to ensure we know you're here. If you plan to arrive later than the arrival date on your reservation, please call the campground office number listed on your reservation paperwork. If we don't hear from you by noon after the first night on your reservation, and you have not checked in, you will forfeit your entire reservation. The person whose name is on the reservation must check in with valid photo identification.\n\n## How can I cancel or change my reservation?\n\nCall 877/444-6777 to change or cancel your reservation. You can also log in to \u301018\u2020recreation.gov\u2020www.recreation.gov\u3011 to cancel your reservation.  \n\nLast updated: September 13, 2023\n\n## Park footer\n\n### Contact Info\n\n#### Phone:\n\n209"
