            "To craft an essay on why you want to study at Boston University (BU), you can integrate the unique features of BU into a cohesive narrative that ties your academic, professional, and personal aspirations to what the university offers. Here's a potential structure for the essay:\n\n---\n\n**Introduction: Personal Connection and Ambitions**\n\nStart by discussing your academic and career goals, as well as the kind of environment you believe will foster your growth. For example:\n\n*\"As someone deeply passionate about [your field of interest], I am seeking a university that not only excels academically but also provides opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, cutting-edge research, and global experiences. After extensive research, I am convinced that Boston University offers the perfect environment for me to thrive.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 1: Diverse Academic Offerings**\n\nYou can highlight BU's comprehensive academic programs and how they align with your academic goals:\n\n*\"With over 300 programs across 17 schools and colleges, BU offers a breadth of academic opportunities that few other universities can match. The flexibility to explore interdisciplinary studies, particularly in [your major], is incredibly appealing. The ability to pursue diverse academic interests at a top-tier research institution is crucial to my growth as a scholar and professional.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 2: Research Opportunities**\n\nThis is where you can emphasize BU's strong commitment to research and how that excites you:\n\n*\"BU\u2019s status as a leading private research institution, with over $580 million in research awards annually, aligns perfectly with my desire to engage in groundbreaking research. I am eager to work alongside world-class faculty, particularly in the field of [specific area], and contribute to innovative projects that address global challenges.\"*\u30109\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 3: Global Focus**\n\nHere, you can discuss BU\u2019s international outlook and how it matches your desire to gain global exposure:\n\n*\"Boston University\u2019s global focus is another significant factor in my decision. The fact that 24% of students are international reflects the rich diversity on campus, and I am excited about the opportunity to interact with peers from all over the world. Moreover, BU\u2019s extensive study abroad programs will allow me to immerse myself in different cultures while continuing my academic journey.\"*\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 4: The Urban Environment and Opportunities in Boston**\n\nThis section can touch on the advantages of BU's location in Boston:\n\n*\"Being located in the heart of Boston, BU offers unparalleled access to a wealth of professional and cultural opportunities. From internships with leading companies to engaging with the city\u2019s history and vibrant arts scene, I look forward to utilizing Boston as an extension of the classroom. This urban environment will provide the real-world experience I need to succeed in my career.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 5: Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion**\n\nHere you can emphasize BU\u2019s diverse and inclusive environment, relating it to your personal values:\n\n*\"BU\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion resonates with me on a personal level. With a student body that represents a range of ethnicities, backgrounds, and perspectives, I am excited about the chance to contribute to and learn from such a vibrant community. BU\u2019s culture of openness and engagement with social issues is exactly what I am looking for in a university experience.\"*\u30108\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: Future at BU**\n\nWrap up by summarizing why BU is the ideal fit for your academic journey and personal growth:\n\n*\"Ultimately, I believe that Boston University is the ideal place for me to achieve my academic and professional goals. The university\u2019s unique combination of academic rigor, research opportunities, global engagement, and commitment to diversity creates an environment where I can challenge myself and grow into a well-rounded individual. I am excited to contribute to and benefit from BU\u2019s dynamic community.\"*\n\n---\n\nThis structure allows you to cover all of the key points that make BU unique, while aligning them with your personal motivations and goals.

            "To make your essay more specific to Boston University (BU), you can deeply connect your aspirations with BU's unique programs, opportunities, and campus culture. Here's a revised version of the essay with more explicit references to BU's attributes:\n\n---\n\n**Introduction: Personal Connection and Ambitions**\n\n*\"As someone passionate about [your area of study], I am seeking a university that fosters both academic rigor and global engagement. After exploring numerous universities, Boston University stands out for its ability to offer diverse academic programs, world-class research opportunities, and a vibrant, international community. BU's commitment to preparing students for a globalized world aligns with my personal and professional goals, making it my top choice.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 1: Academic Excellence and Specific Programs**\n\n*\"What excites me most about BU is its breadth of academic offerings. As someone interested in [specific major/program], BU\u2019s [mention of specific school, like Questrom School of Business or College of Communication] provides the ideal environment for me to delve deeply into my field. The chance to engage with BU\u2019s [specific program or initiative, such as the Kilachand Honors College or BU Hub interdisciplinary curriculum] will allow me to pursue a well-rounded education while focusing on critical areas like [mention particular areas of interest]. BU\u2019s reputation for fostering intellectual curiosity across disciplines is exactly what I am looking for in a university.\"*\u30107\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 2: Cutting-Edge Research Opportunities**\n\n*\"As one of the top private research universities in the nation, BU\u2019s focus on innovative research is a major draw for me. I am particularly interested in [mention specific lab, research center, or faculty member\u2019s work] and how the university supports undergraduate research through initiatives like the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). Whether contributing to projects at the Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing or exploring sustainability initiatives, I am eager to participate in the groundbreaking work that BU facilitates.\"*\u30109\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 3: Global Focus and Study Abroad**\n\n*\"Boston University\u2019s global focus is another key factor in my decision. With over 24% of its students coming from around the world and a robust study abroad program that spans six continents, BU offers a truly global experience. I am especially excited about the opportunity to study abroad at BU\u2019s programs in [mention specific location, like London, Paris, or Sydney], where I can immerse myself in different cultures while continuing my academic journey. BU\u2019s commitment to global citizenship aligns perfectly with my goal of working in [mention desired international field or career], and the university\u2019s diverse student body will enrich my experience both inside and outside the classroom.\"*\u301010\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 4: The Urban Experience in Boston**\n\n*\"The vibrant city of Boston is the ideal backdrop for my college experience. As one of the most dynamic and historic cities in the U.S., Boston offers unparalleled opportunities for internships, networking, and cultural engagement. Being in the heart of a thriving city gives BU students direct access to companies, museums, and industries that are leaders in their fields. I am particularly drawn to BU\u2019s collaborations with institutions like Massachusetts General Hospital and tech companies in the area, which would allow me to gain hands-on experience in [mention specific field]. Boston\u2019s urban setting, combined with BU\u2019s proximity to innovation hubs, is exactly what I need to complement my studies.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Paragraph 5: Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion**\n\n*\"BU\u2019s dedication to creating an inclusive and diverse campus community is another reason why I am eager to join. With 58% of domestic students identifying as students of color, BU\u2019s emphasis on diversity resonates with my values. I look forward to contributing to organizations like [mention specific club or group, such as the Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground or a cultural group] that promote dialogue and understanding across different cultures. Furthermore, BU\u2019s commitment to first-generation college students, as reflected in the 21% of the Class of 2027 who are the first in their families to attend college, creates an environment where all students can thrive.\"*\u301010\u2020source\u3011\u301011\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: Why BU is My Ideal Fit**\n\n*\"Ultimately, BU\u2019s combination of academic excellence, research opportunities, global engagement, and a diverse, urban campus make it the perfect fit for my aspirations. I am excited to challenge myself in BU\u2019s rigorous programs, contribute to its vibrant community, and take advantage of all the opportunities Boston University has to offer. I am confident that BU will help me grow not only as a student but as a global citizen ready to make an impact in [mention specific career path or goal].\"*\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on specific programs, research centers, and initiatives at BU, you create a compelling case that demonstrates why you are both a good fit for BU and how BU meets your personal goals."

            "Boston University (BU) is unique among large universities in several ways that set it apart:\n\n1. **Global Focus**: Unlike many other large universities, BU places a significant emphasis on global engagement. With one of the highest percentages of international students in the U.S. (24% of the student body) and over 90 study abroad programs across six continents, BU fosters an international outlook that\u2019s integrated into nearly every facet of campus life. This strong global orientation appeals to students looking for a truly international experience\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Location and Urban Integration**: While many large universities are located in college towns, BU is fully integrated into the vibrant city of Boston. The university's campus stretches along Commonwealth Avenue, blending seamlessly into the city\u2019s urban landscape. BU students benefit from access to Boston\u2019s vast cultural, historical, and professional opportunities, with the city acting as an extension of the classroom. Few universities offer the same level of engagement with a major metropolitan city\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary Education**: BU stands out for its emphasis on interdisciplinary education through initiatives like the BU Hub, which allows students to explore multiple disciplines outside of their major. This approach encourages cross-departmental learning and a well-rounded academic experience that is not always emphasized at other large institutions\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Pioneering Research**: Boston University is a major research powerhouse, with over $580 million in research expenditures annually. Its Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) offers undergraduates unique access to participate in faculty-led research across various fields, a level of involvement often not found at other large research universities. This extensive research focus extends to interdisciplinary centers like the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, which engages students in solving global issues\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. **Inclusive and Diverse Community**: BU has a strong commitment to diversity, both socioeconomically and culturally. About 58% of domestic students are students of color, and the university is known for welcoming first-generation college students and Pell Grant recipients. BU\u2019s diversity fosters a campus environment where students from all backgrounds can succeed, something that many large universities strive for but may not achieve to the same extent\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n6. **BU\u2019s Commitment to Innovation**: BU is consistently innovating in both its academic programs and extracurricular offerings. For example, the Questrom School of Business has a highly regarded curriculum that integrates technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship into the business world, giving students real-world skills that stand out in comparison to traditional business programs at other large universities\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThese elements\u2014combined with BU\u2019s urban setting, global focus, commitment to interdisciplinary learning, and robust research opportunities\u2014create a distinctive experience that sets it apart from other large universities."

            "Yes, Boston University has a program specifically designed to help international exchange students transition into life at BU and in the U.S. This initiative is part of the *Global Programs Office* and includes programs like the **International Peer Mentor Program (IPMP)**, which pairs international students with current BU students. These mentors help newcomers adjust to the academic, cultural, and social environment at BU, offering guidance on everything from navigating campus life to understanding American customs.\n\nIn addition, the **International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO)** offers various support services to international students, including orientation programs that help students integrate smoothly into the university community and U.S. life. There are also cultural events, workshops, and opportunities for international students to engage with the broader BU community.\n\nFor more information, you can check out BU's [Global Programs Office](https://www.bu.edu/globalprograms) and the [ISSO](https://www.bu.edu/isso) for details on student support initiatives."

The IPM program \u2013 originally conceived by the Office of Orientation \u2013 \u201cis designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,\u201d\u00a0according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director,\u00a0Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year\u2019s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920)\n\n\u201cAs an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,\u201d said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920). \u201cYou\u2019re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who\u2019s gone through that process is really important.\u201d\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,\u201d Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n\u30106\u2020The Compass\u3011\u00a0is a full suite of resources to support BU\u2019s international community. Academic, community, housing, and career-related resources and information can be found on the Compass.\n\n\u30107\u2020First Class\u3011\u00a0is\u00a0an online noncredit pre-arrival course designed to prepare incoming international students for the transition to BU and the American classroom.\u00a0It is delivered on the edX platform Edge and is comprised of short videos, polls, and self-checks designed to be completed from anywhere on any device.\n\n\u201cIt [First Class] taught me how to prepare myself for academics and social life \u2013 and vocabulary that can be really helpful, like syllabus\u2026what it\u2019s for and how to use it,\u201d said Ariane Vigna (COM \u201822). \u201cIt was also helpful because it directed us to resources on campus, and it helped me transition to BU.\u201d\n\nThese resources, in conjunction with the IPM program, aim to support students in their first year at BU and deepen connections between students from many different backgrounds and lived experiences. It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about self-confidence,\u201d Samarasekera said. \u201cAt first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.\u201d\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## \u30108\u2020October 2021\u3011\n\n## \u30109\u2020December 2019\u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301010\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301011\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301012\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301013\u2020BU Calendar\u3011\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM \u301014\u2020Asian Students Support Group\u3011\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM \u301015\u2020Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus\u3011\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM \u301016\u2020BU Career Fair\u3011\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Boston University\u3011 \u301018\u2020Global Programs \u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Study Abroad\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020International Students & Scholars Office\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Center for English Language & Orientation Programs\u3011\n\n  *     * \u301022\u2020Notice of Nondiscrimination\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

The IPM program \u2013 originally conceived by the Office of Orientation \u2013 \u201cis designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,\u201d\u00a0according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director,\u00a0Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year\u2019s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920)\n\n\u201cAs an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,\u201d said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920). \u201cYou\u2019re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who\u2019s gone through that process is really important.\u201d\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,\u201d Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n\u30106\u2020The Compass\u3011\u00a0is a full suite of resources to support BU\u2019s international community. Academic, community, housing, and career-related resources and information can be found on the Compass.\n\n\u30107\u2020First Class\u3011\u00a0is\u00a0an online noncredit pre-arrival course designed to prepare incoming international students for the transition to BU and the American classroom.\u00a0It is delivered on the edX platform Edge and is comprised of short videos, polls, and self-checks designed to be completed from anywhere on any device.\n\n\u201cIt [First Class] taught me how to prepare myself for academics and social life \u2013 and vocabulary that can be really helpful, like syllabus\u2026what it\u2019s for and how to use it,\u201d said Ariane Vigna (COM \u201822). \u201cIt was also helpful because it directed us to resources on campus, and it helped me transition to BU.\u201d\n\nThese resources, in conjunction with the IPM program, aim to support students in their first year at BU and deepen connections between students from many different backgrounds and lived experiences. It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about self-confidence,\u201d Samarasekera said. \u201cAt first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.\u201d\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## \u30108\u2020October 2021\u3011\n\n## \u30109\u2020December 2019\u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301010\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301011\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301012\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301013\u2020BU Calendar\u3011\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM \u301014\u2020Asian Students Support Group\u3011\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM \u301015\u2020Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus\u3011\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM \u301016\u2020BU Career Fair\u3011\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Boston University\u3011 \u301018\u2020Global Programs \u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Study Abroad\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020International Students & Scholars Office\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Center for English Language & Orientation Programs\u3011\n\n  *     * \u301022\u2020Notice of Nondiscrimination\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

The IPM program \u2013 originally conceived by the Office of Orientation \u2013 \u201cis designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,\u201d\u00a0according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director,\u00a0Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year\u2019s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920)\n\n\u201cAs an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,\u201d said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920). \u201cYou\u2019re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who\u2019s gone through that process is really important.\u201d\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,\u201d Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n\u30106\u2020The Compass\u3011\u00a0is a full suite of resources to support BU\u2019s international community.

It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about self-confidence,\u201d Samarasekera said. \u201cAt first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.\u201d\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## \u30108\u2020October 2021\u3011\n\n## \u30109\u2020December 2019\u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301010\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301011\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301012\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301013\u2020BU Calendar\u3011\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM \u301014\u2020Asian Students Support Group\u3011\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM \u301015\u2020Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus\u3011\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM \u301016\u2020BU Career Fair\u3011\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Boston University\u3011 \u301018\u2020Global Programs \u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Study Abroad\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020International Students & Scholars Office\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Center for English Language & Orientation Programs\u3011\n\n  *     * \u301022\u2020Notice of Nondiscrimination\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

            "Boston University (BU) offers an **International Peer Mentor Program (IPMP)**, which is designed to support incoming international students as they transition to life at BU and in the U.S. The program connects new students with current BU students who act as mentors, providing guidance on academics, social life, and cultural adaptation. These mentors help international students adjust to the new environment by answering questions, offering a supportive ear, and introducing them to various resources across campus, such as the **Compass**, a resource hub for academic, housing, and career-related information.\n\nThe program begins before international students arrive, with mentors helping them navigate their new life from day one. The IPMP even includes a pre-arrival course called **First Class**, delivered online to help students prepare for academic life at BU.\n\nFor more details, you can check out the program on BU's website [here](https://www.bu.edu/globalprograms/2019/09/23/ipm-welcomes)\u301029\u2020source\u3011\u301030\u2020source\u3011."

The IPM program \u2013 originally conceived by the Office of Orientation \u2013 \u201cis designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,\u201d\u00a0according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director,\u00a0Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year\u2019s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920)\n\n\u201cAs an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,\u201d said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920). \u201cYou\u2019re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who\u2019s gone through that process is really important.\u201d\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,\u201d Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n\u30106\u2020The Compass\u3011\u00a0is a full suite of resources to support BU\u2019s international community. Academic, community, housing, and career-related resources and information can be found on the Compass.\n\n\u30107\u2020First Class\u3011\u00a0is\u00a0an online noncredit pre-arrival course designed to prepare incoming international students for the transition to BU and the American classroom.\u00a0It is delivered on the edX platform Edge and is comprised of short videos, polls, and self-checks designed to be completed from anywhere on any device.\n\n\u201cIt [First Class] taught me how to prepare myself for academics and social life \u2013 and vocabulary that can be really helpful, like syllabus\u2026what it\u2019s for and how to use it,\u201d said Ariane Vigna (COM \u201822). \u201cIt was also helpful because it directed us to resources on campus, and it helped me transition to BU.\u201d\n\nThese resources, in conjunction with the IPM program, aim to support students in their first year at BU and deepen connections between students from many different backgrounds and lived experiences. It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about self-confidence,\u201d Samarasekera said. \u201cAt first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.\u201d\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## \u30108\u2020October 2021\u3011\n\n## \u30109\u2020December 2019\u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301010\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301011\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301012\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301013\u2020BU Calendar\u3011\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM \u301014\u2020Asian Students Support Group\u3011\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM \u301015\u2020Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus\u3011\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM \u301016\u2020BU Career Fair\u3011\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Boston University\u3011 \u301018\u2020Global Programs \u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Study Abroad\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020International Students & Scholars Office\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Center for English Language & Orientation Programs\u3011\n\n  *     * \u301022\u2020Notice of Nondiscrimination\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%"

            "Yes, freshmen at Boston University can participate in the **International Peer Mentor Program (IPMP)** as mentees. This program is specifically designed to help new international students, including freshmen, adjust to life at BU and in the U.S. through peer support. The mentors are typically upperclassmen or experienced BU students who help guide new students through the transition process, offering insights on academics, social life, and navigating the campus.\n\nIf you're an international freshman, you can be matched with a mentor to help ease your transition. Later on, after gaining some experience at BU, you could even apply to become a mentor yourself.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the [IPMP program page](https://www.bu.edu/globalprograms/2019/09/23/ipm-welcomes)\u301029\u2020source\u3011\u301030\u2020source\u3011."

The IPM program \u2013 originally conceived by the Office of Orientation \u2013 \u201cis designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,\u201d\u00a0according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director,\u00a0Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year\u2019s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920)\n\n\u201cAs an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,\u201d said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920). \u201cYou\u2019re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who\u2019s gone through that process is really important.\u201d\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,\u201d Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n\u30106\u2020The Compass\u3011\u00a0is a full suite of resources to support BU\u2019s international community. Academic, community, housing, and career-related resources and information can be found on the Compass.\n\n\u30107\u2020First Class\u3011\u00a0is\u00a0an online noncredit pre-arrival course designed to prepare incoming international students for the transition to BU and the American classroom.\u00a0It is delivered on the edX platform Edge and is comprised of short videos, polls, and self-checks designed to be completed from anywhere on any device.\n\n\u201cIt [First Class] taught me how to prepare myself for academics and social life \u2013 and vocabulary that can be really helpful, like syllabus\u2026what it\u2019s for and how to use it,\u201d said Ariane Vigna (COM \u201822). \u201cIt was also helpful because it directed us to resources on campus, and it helped me transition to BU.\u201d\n\nThese resources, in conjunction with the IPM program, aim to support students in their first year at BU and deepen connections between students from many different backgrounds and lived experiences. It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about self-confidence,\u201d Samarasekera said. \u201cAt first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.\u201d\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## \u30108\u2020October 2021\u3011\n\n## \u30109\u2020December 2019\u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301010\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301011\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301012\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301013\u2020BU Calendar\u3011\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM \u301014\u2020Asian Students Support Group\u3011\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM \u301015\u2020Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus\u3011\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM \u301016\u2020BU Career Fair\u3011\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Boston University\u3011 \u301018\u2020Global Programs \u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Study Abroad\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020International Students & Scholars Office\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Center for English Language & Orientation Programs\u3011\n\n  *     * \u301022\u2020Notice of Nondiscrimination\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

To request a TTBU peer mentor, email ttbu@bu.edu.\n\nYour TTBU peer mentor can help you figure out where to eat, how to get your books, where to find your academic advisor, how to join a club, and more.\n\nTTBU also holds events to help transfer students make connections with each other and with continuing students. They can help you start to build your community at BU.\n\nYou can connect with TTBU through email, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSome schools and even some majors also have peer mentoring programs for transfer students. Ask your academic advisor or stop by your school\u2019s advising or student services office to learn about school-based opportunities.\n\nTTBU mentors say the following resources are especially helpful as you\u2019re getting started at BU:\n\n###### ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n  * \u301041\u2020Academic Advising Contacts for Transfer Students\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Educational Resource Center (ERC)\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Disability and Access Services\u3011\n\n###### HOUSING & RESIDENCE LIFE\n\n  * \u301044\u2020BU Housing\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020Your Res Life Office\u3011\n  * \u301046\u2020BU Faculty in Residence\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020Your Resident Assistant (RA)\u3011\n\n###### TUITION & FINANCIAL AID\n\n  * \u301048\u2020Financial Assistance Office\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Student Accounting Services\u3011\n  * \u301050\u2020University Service Center (USC)\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Student Employment and Quickie Job Listings\u3011\n\n###### FINDING COMMUNITY\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Howard Thurman Center (HTC)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Student Activities Office (SAO)\u3011\u301053\u2020 \u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020Community Service Center (CSC)\u3011\n\n###### PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Fitness & Recreation Center (FitRec)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Wellness and Prevention Services\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Student Health Services (SHS)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020Behavioral Medicine\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Services (SARP)\u3011\n\n##  Related to Peer Mentors and Student Life \n\n### \u301021\u2020For Students\u3011\n\n  * \u30102\u2020First-Year Students\u3011 \n  * \u30103\u2020Transfer Students\u3011 \n    * \u301060\u2020Meet Your Assistant Director of Transfer Success\u3011 \n    * \u301061\u2020Transfer Advising\u3011 \n    * \u301062\u2020Transferring Credits\u3011 \n    * \u301063\u2020Academic Requirements\u3011 \n    * \u301064\u2020Peer Mentors and Student Life\u3011 \n    * \u301065\u2020Get Involved\u3011 \n  * \u301022\u2020Connect with the Community\u3011 \n  * \u301023\u2020BU Campus Events\u3011 \n\n### Related Links\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Degree Advice\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Course Search\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020BU Bulletin\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020MyBU Student Portal\u2020student.bu.edu\u3011\n\n### \u301070\u2020Upcoming Events\u3011\n\n  * 10.15 \u301071\u2020Workshop: Manage Your Time and Productivity\u3011 \n  * 10.15 \u301072\u2020Goldwater Scholarship Information Session\u3011 \n  * 10.16 \u301073\u2020Workshop: Avoiding Plagiarism & Integrating Sources\u3011 \n  * 10.16 \u301074\u2020Writing Fellow Pop-Up\u3011 \n  * 10.17 \u301075\u2020Thursday Write-Togethers\u3011 \n\n  * \u301076\u2020Boston University Office of the Provost: Undergraduate Advising & Student Success\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Twitter\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u301078\u2020Instagram\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u301079\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301080\u2020Photography on this Site\u3011\n  * \u301081\u2020BU Hub\u3011\n\n\u00a9 Boston\u00a0University.

The IPM program \u2013 originally conceived by the Office of Orientation \u2013 \u201cis designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,\u201d\u00a0according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director,\u00a0Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year\u2019s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920)\n\n\u201cAs an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,\u201d said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG \u201920). \u201cYou\u2019re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who\u2019s gone through that process is really important.\u201d\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,\u201d Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n\u30106\u2020The Compass\u3011\u00a0is a full suite of resources to support BU\u2019s international community. Academic, community, housing, and career-related resources and information can be found on the Compass.\n\n\u30107\u2020First Class\u3011\u00a0is\u00a0an online noncredit pre-arrival course designed to prepare incoming international students for the transition to BU and the American classroom.\u00a0It is delivered on the edX platform Edge and is comprised of short videos, polls, and self-checks designed to be completed from anywhere on any device.\n\n\u201cIt [First Class] taught me how to prepare myself for academics and social life \u2013 and vocabulary that can be really helpful, like syllabus\u2026what it\u2019s for and how to use it,\u201d said Ariane Vigna (COM \u201822). \u201cIt was also helpful because it directed us to resources on campus, and it helped me transition to BU.\u201d\n\nThese resources, in conjunction with the IPM program, aim to support students in their first year at BU and deepen connections between students from many different backgrounds and lived experiences. It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about self-confidence,\u201d Samarasekera said. \u201cAt first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.\u201d\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## \u30108\u2020October 2021\u3011\n\n## \u30109\u2020December 2019\u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301010\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301011\u2020 \u3011\n\n## Global Feature\n\n\u301012\u2020 \u3011 \n\n## \u301013\u2020BU Calendar\u3011\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM \u301014\u2020Asian Students Support Group\u3011\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM \u301015\u2020Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus\u3011\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM \u301016\u2020BU Career Fair\u3011\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Boston University\u3011 \u301018\u2020Global Programs \u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Study Abroad\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020International Students & Scholars Office\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Center for English Language & Orientation Programs\u3011\n\n  *     * \u301022\u2020Notice of Nondiscrimination\u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%"

To request a TTBU peer mentor, email ttbu@bu.edu.\n\nYour TTBU peer mentor can help you figure out where to eat, how to get your books, where to find your academic advisor, how to join a club, and more.\n\nTTBU also holds events to help transfer students make connections with each other and with continuing students. They can help you start to build your community at BU.\n\nYou can connect with TTBU through email, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSome schools and even some majors also have peer mentoring programs for transfer students. Ask your academic advisor or stop by your school\u2019s advising or student services office to learn about school-based opportunities.\n\nTTBU mentors say the following resources are especially helpful as you\u2019re getting started at BU:\n\n###### ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n  * \u301041\u2020Academic Advising Contacts for Transfer Students\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Educational Resource Center (ERC)\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Disability and Access Services\u3011\n\n###### HOUSING & RESIDENCE LIFE\n\n  * \u301044\u2020BU Housing\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020Your Res Life Office\u3011\n  * \u301046\u2020BU Faculty in Residence\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020Your Resident Assistant (RA)\u3011\n\n###### TUITION & FINANCIAL AID\n\n  * \u301048\u2020Financial Assistance Office\u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020Student Accounting Services\u3011\n  * \u301050\u2020University Service Center (USC)\u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020Student Employment and Quickie Job Listings\u3011\n\n###### FINDING COMMUNITY\n\n  * \u301052\u2020Howard Thurman Center (HTC)\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Student Activities Office (SAO)\u3011\u301053\u2020 \u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020Community Service Center (CSC)\u3011\n\n###### PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Fitness & Recreation Center (FitRec)\u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020Wellness and Prevention Services\u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020Student Health Services (SHS)\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020Behavioral Medicine\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Services (SARP)\u3011\n\n##  Related to Peer Mentors and Student Life \n\n### \u301021\u2020For Students\u3011\n\n  * \u30102\u2020First-Year Students\u3011 \n  * \u30103\u2020Transfer Students\u3011 \n    * \u301060\u2020Meet Your Assistant Director of Transfer Success\u3011 \n    * \u301061\u2020Transfer Advising\u3011 \n    * \u301062\u2020Transferring Credits\u3011 \n    * \u301063\u2020Academic Requirements\u3011 \n    * \u301064\u2020Peer Mentors and Student Life\u3011 \n    * \u301065\u2020Get Involved\u3011 \n  * \u301022\u2020Connect with the Community\u3011 \n  * \u301023\u2020BU Campus Events\u3011 \n\n### Related Links\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Degree Advice\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Course Search\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020BU Bulletin\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020MyBU Student Portal\u2020student.bu.edu\u3011\n\n### \u301070\u2020Upcoming Events\u3011\n\n  * 10.15 \u301071\u2020Workshop: Manage Your Time and Productivity\u3011 \n  * 10.15 \u301072\u2020Goldwater Scholarship Information Session\u3011 \n  * 10.16 \u301073\u2020Workshop: Avoiding Plagiarism & Integrating Sources\u3011 \n  * 10.16 \u301074\u2020Writing Fellow Pop-Up\u3011 \n  * 10.17 \u301075\u2020Thursday Write-Togethers\u3011 \n\n  * \u301076\u2020Boston University Office of the Provost: Undergraduate Advising & Student Success\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Twitter\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n  * \u301078\u2020Instagram\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n  * \u301079\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301080\u2020Photography on this Site\u3011\n  * \u301081\u2020BU Hub\u3011\n\n\u00a9 Boston\u00a0University.
