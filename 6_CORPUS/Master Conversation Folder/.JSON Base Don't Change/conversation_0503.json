            "please rewrite in a concise format.  My goal here is to justify the decision I made since it was based on the most recent information that I had.  I want to emphasize that at that time I was giving away nothing and was hedging against a possible last minute price reduction before contract signing.  I was giving away a speculative win with a very low probability for the certainty of the agreement we already had: Summary - Phil was very concerned with the drop in DC long term strips as final contracts were being signed.\u00a0 He agreed to move forward with the project despite returns on his end at significant risk. They were slow walking the contract and I was concerned. Understanding\u00a0that this project was a January 2025 mobilization, and being told that 2024 MC was out of the question, I told him that it would be up to him as to whether he claimed 2024 based on what work was completed.\u00a0 I said that if he does that, then we would still keep our $/Watt at 2025 levels.\nDetails below:\nDuring final contact\u00a0review\u00a0you had said something along the lines of \"if any of you think we are getting this job done this year get that idea out of your heads.\"\u00a0 All install schedules had this starting in January.On October 8th, Phil Thompson and I had this text exchange.\u00a0 He was spooked by the recent\u00a0changes in the REC market due to a budget provision snuck in by the mayor in September that dropped REC demand by about 10%.\u00a0 Long term markets were adjusting strips to reflect uncertainty.\u00a0 I made some calls and verified this. \nI did not want to have this deal fall through at the 11th hour, so I told him that if he was comfortable claiming 2024 MC EOY based on the amount of progress made, we would still keep the $/Watt at 2025 levels even if he claimed as 2024\u00a0project.\u00a0 I made this decision based on the following:Based on everything I was told, this project was mobilizing in 2025, and if we were able to begin some kind of work\u00a0before, it would be up to him as to what degree of progress he was comfortable defining as \"mechanically complete\".\u00a0\u00a0I was giving nothing away.\u00a0 We valued this job at 2025 numbers and were making all of our decisions based on them.\u00a0 If I thought that 2024 was a reality for us I would have acted differently.I was proactively avoiding the potential future conversation involving a lower overall EPC for us which I saw as a real possibility.\u00a0\u00a0On Thursday, October 15th, they had asked for us to remove the bonus clause from the contract.\u00a0 I called Ryan and we discussed, where I was told that there was a potential path to prioritize this project.\u00a0 This was the first I had heard this.\u00a0 Changes were agreed to.EPCA was signed on 10/17.After signing, Phil and I exchanged the following texts:\n \nSince this had now become a reality I tried to take the moral frame and say 'I believe you were doing right by us and I wanted to reciprocate by doing right by you.\u00a0 If your situation improves due to our efforts, then it would be appropriate if our situation improved as well\".That is all the context that I can provide."

I maintained our 2025 $/Watt pricing to hedge against a potential price drop before contract signing, effectively swapping a speculative, low-probability win for the certainty of the current agreement.\n\n**Summary:**  \nPhil was very concerned about the recent drop in long-term DC REC strips as contracts were finalized, which put his project returns at risk. The client was slow-walking the contract, raising concerns about commitment. Given that the project\u2019s mobilization was set for January 2025, and the 2024 MC was off the table, I assured him he could claim 2024 if enough work was completed, while we would still adhere to 2025 pricing.\n\n**Supporting Details:**\n1. **Contract Timing and Project Start**: All schedules pointed to a January 2025 mobilization, reinforcing the 2025 valuation.\n  \n2. **Market Conditions**: On October 8, Phil expressed concerns over a 10% drop in REC demand due to a budget provision, impacting long-term market stability. After verifying these market shifts, I offered him the option to claim 2024 MC without altering our 2025 $/Watt pricing. This avoided last-minute negotiation risks without giving up value.\n\n3. **Bonus Clause Discussion**: On October 15, the client requested the removal of a bonus clause. After consulting with Ryan, who suggested a possible path to prioritize the project, we agreed to the changes, and the EPCA was signed on October 17.\n\n4. **Post-Signing Discussions**: After the signing, I emphasized that our commitment to the project was mutual. I stated that if our support improved their situation, a similar adjustment on our end would be fair.\n\nThis context explains my proactive decision-making, driven by a balance of certainty and strategic risk management."

Given the slow-walking of the contract, I was cautious about committing without assurance. Since the project mobilization was set for January 2025, and I was informed that 2024 MC was off the table, I clarified that any decision to claim 2024 project completion would be Phil\u2019s to make, depending on what level of work he was comfortable defining as \"mechanically complete.\" Our 2025 $/Watt pricing would hold, even if he chose to assume the risk of claiming it as a 2024 project.\n\n**Supporting Details:**\n1. **Contract Timing and Project Start**: All schedules confirmed a January 2025 mobilization, which set our valuation at 2025 levels. I based all decisions on this timeline.\n\n2. **Market Conditions and Client Concerns**: On October 8, Phil reached out, concerned over a 10% drop in REC demand, spurred by a recent budget provision. After verifying this market shift, I reassured him that any decision to claim 2024 completion would be his, based on the progress made and his comfort level with the risk. This arrangement secured our $/Watt pricing at 2025 rates, regardless of his choice.\n\n3. **Bonus Clause and EPCA**: On October 15, the client requested removal of the bonus clause. Following a discussion with Ryan, where I learned of a potential path to prioritize the project, we agreed to these contract changes. The EPCA was signed on October 17.\n\n4. **Post-Signing Discussions**: After signing, I reiterated that if Phil\u2019s situation improved due to prioritization, it would be fair to revisit our arrangement accordingly.\n\nThis context clarifies that any decision to claim 2024 completion was entirely Phil\u2019s, based on his risk tolerance, while I remained focused on safeguarding our position and maintaining stability with the 2025 agreement."

            "Here\u2019s a more detailed version, incorporating elements from your text exchanges to emphasize that Phil\u2019s decision to claim 2024 completion was at his discretion:\n\n---\n\nAt the time of my decision, I acted on the most recent information available, ensuring we secured the deal without risking last-minute changes. I maintained our 2025 $/Watt pricing to guard against potential price reductions before contract signing, effectively trading a speculative, low-probability win for the certainty of our current agreement.\n\n**Summary:**  \nPhil expressed concern about a recent drop in DC REC long-term strips due to market volatility as contracts were being finalized, which put his project returns at significant risk. The client was slow-walking the contract, heightening my concerns. Given that mobilization was set for January 2025, and I was informed that the 2024 MC was unrealistic, I explained to Phil that any decision to claim 2024 project completion was entirely his call, based on whatever level of work he was comfortable defining as \"mechanically complete.\" Our 2025 $/Watt rate would remain unchanged even if he chose to claim 2024\u2014a decision that placed all responsibility for this risk on him.\n\n**Supporting Details:**\n1. **Contract Timing and Project Start**: During the contract review, it was made clear that we\u2019d be mobilizing in January 2025. I remember stating something like, \"if anyone thinks this job is happening this year, they should get that idea out of their heads,\" which aligned with all install schedules pointing to a January start. Our valuation and decisions were firmly based on this timeline.\n\n2. **October 8 Text Exchange \u2013 Market Concerns**: Phil texted me, worried about a 10% drop in REC demand tied to a budget provision added by the mayor, which was impacting long-term market stability. After making some calls to confirm this, I texted back to reassure him, letting him know that the choice to claim 2024 completion would be his, depending on his comfort level with what qualified as \u201cmechanically complete.\u201d I explained that we\u2019d keep the 2025 pricing regardless. This approach kept our position stable while giving him flexibility to manage his own risk in claiming 2024.\n\n3. **October 15 Bonus Clause Discussion**: Phil\u2019s team requested the removal of the bonus clause from the contract on October 15. Following a discussion with Ryan, I learned there might be a pathway to prioritize the project, and we agreed to the requested contract changes. This was the first indication of a possible 2024 acceleration, but our expectations and pricing stayed consistent with 2025. The EPCA was signed on October 17.\n\n4. **Post-Signing Texts**: After signing, Phil and I exchanged messages in which I reinforced my commitment to acting in mutual good faith. I explained, \u201cI believe you were doing right by us, and I wanted to reciprocate by doing right by you. If your situation improves due to our prioritization efforts, it would be fair for our arrangement to reflect that.\u201d\n\nThis context clarifies that my decision to maintain the 2025 pricing framework was based on all available information at the time. Any choice to claim 2024 completion was fully Phil\u2019s, with the risk profile entirely his to evaluate."

By maintaining our 2025 $/Watt pricing, I was protecting our position, ensuring the stability of our current agreement while not conceding anything of value.

Since all plans and schedules pointed to a January 2025 mobilization\u2014and I was explicitly told that a 2024 timeline was not possible\u2014I assured Phil that claiming 2024 completion would be entirely his call, based on the level of work he considered \u201cmechanically complete.\u201d Our 2025 $/Watt pricing would stay intact regardless, which avoided the risk of a last-minute reduction. This decision allowed us to secure the certainty of our deal without giving anything away.\n\n**Supporting Details:**\n1. **Project Timing and Install Schedule**: During contract review, I was told unequivocally that a 2024 installation was off the table. I recall making it clear by saying something along the lines of, \u201cIf anyone thinks this job is happening this year, they should get that idea out of their heads.\u201d All schedules confirmed a January 2025 mobilization, and my actions were based on this assumption, ensuring our position was secured with no concessions.\n\n2. **October 8 Text Exchange \u2013 Market Volatility and REC Concerns**: On October 8, Phil reached out, alarmed by a 10% drop in REC demand due to a budget adjustment by the mayor, which significantly impacted the REC market. After verifying this, I texted Phil to clarify that he could claim 2024 if he felt progress met his standards for \u201cmechanically complete,\u201d but our 2025 pricing would remain unchanged. This structure protected our position while allowing Phil to manage his own risk based on his judgment of the project\u2019s timeline.\n\n3. **October 15 Bonus Clause Request**: On October 15, Phil\u2019s team asked to remove the bonus clause. During my conversation with Ryan, I was informed for the first time that there might be an internal pathway to prioritize this project. However, up until that point, all indications had been for a 2025 start. Despite this new information, our expectations and pricing still aligned with a January 2025 timeline. The EPCA was signed on October 17 with these understandings intact.\n\n4. **Post-Signing Texts and Good Faith**: After signing, I reiterated to Phil that my actions were rooted in mutual good faith, emphasizing that I was looking out for both parties. I messaged him to say, \u201cI believe you were doing right by us, so I wanted to reciprocate by doing right by you. If your situation improves due to our prioritization, it would be fair if our arrangement reflected that.\u201d\n\nThis context highlights that my decisions were based on the explicit understanding that a 2024 timeline was impossible.

By holding to our 2025 $/Watt pricing, I was protecting our position, ensuring the stability of our agreement without conceding anything of value.

If any internal priorities had shifted to fast-track the project for 2024, I was not made aware.\n\n**Detailed Context:**  \nPhil was highly concerned about a recent drop in DC REC long-term strips, which affected project returns as contracts were finalizing. The client\u2019s slow-walking of the contract raised further questions about their commitment. Given that all schedules pointed to January 2025 mobilization\u2014and that I was explicitly told 2024 was not an option\u2014I informed Phil that any choice"

            "**My Decision:**  \nI decided to maintain our 2025 $/Watt pricing based on the understanding that the project would mobilize in January 2025, with no chance of meeting a 2024 timeline. This approach protected our position by securing the current agreement without conceding any value. I was effectively trading a low-probability, speculative gain for the certainty of the agreement we already had. Any decision to claim 2024 project completion would be at Phil\u2019s discretion and risk, based on the progress he was comfortable considering \u201cmechanically complete.\u201d If there had been any internal shifts toward prioritizing a 2024 completion, I was not made aware.\n\n**Chronological Timeline:**\n\n1. **Initial Timeline and Assumptions (Contract Review):**  \n   During the final contract review, it was confirmed that the project would mobilize in January 2025. I recall stating, \u201cIf anyone thinks this job is happening this year, they should get that idea out of their heads,\u201d reflecting the clear directive that a 2024 installation was not feasible. All schedules aligned with this January 2025 timeline, and I based my decision-making on this understanding, ensuring our position was safeguarded with no concessions.\n\n2. **October 8 \u2013 Market Volatility and REC Concerns:**  \n   On October 8, Phil contacted me expressing concern over a recent 10% drop in REC demand, attributed to a budget provision added by the mayor. This market shift raised questions about the long-term REC strip prices and introduced uncertainty. After verifying this change with additional contacts, I reassured Phil that any decision to claim 2024 completion would be his, based on his comfort level with defining \u201cmechanically complete.\u201d I clarified that we would maintain the 2025 $/Watt pricing regardless of his decision. This approach allowed him flexibility to assume his own level of risk while securing our stable pricing.\n\n3. **October 15 \u2013 Bonus Clause Removal Request:**  \n   On October 15, Phil\u2019s team requested the removal of the bonus clause from the contract. During a conversation with Ryan about this, I was informed for the first time that there might be a potential path to prioritize the project for 2024. This was the first indication of any internal discussion about possibly accelerating the project. However, based on all previous information and schedules, I continued with our expectation of a January 2025 start. The EPCA was signed on October 17 with our 2025 pricing expectations intact.\n\n4. **Post-Signing Texts and Good Faith:**  \n   After the signing, I reiterated my commitment to a good-faith approach with Phil. I told him, \u201cI believe you were doing right by us, so I wanted to reciprocate by doing right by you. If your situation improves due to our prioritization, it would be fair if our arrangement reflected that.\u201d This reinforced that my actions were guided by protecting our agreement and allowing flexibility within the terms we had set.\n\nThis timeline illustrates that my decisions were rooted in the clear understanding that a 2024 completion was not feasible. If there were any internal priority shifts, I was not informed of them. My approach focused on securing our position, ensuring no concessions were made, and prioritizing the certainty of our existing agreement."
