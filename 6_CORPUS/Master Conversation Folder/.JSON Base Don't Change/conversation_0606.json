            "Yes, there are several **non-standard requirements** in the **Hazlet Township Public School District Solar PPA RFP** that go beyond typical solar PPA agreements. Here are the key ones:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Roof Work Cost Must Be Included in PPA Price Adder**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - The awarded contractor must evaluate and potentially **fund roof work** as part of the PPA.\n  - Costs for **roof repairs or replacements** required for solar installation **must be included as a price adder** to the PPA rate.  \n  - The district will evaluate whether to **extend the roof warranty through the life of the PPA** (specifically for **Raritan Valley Elementary School**).  \n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Typically, school districts handle roof maintenance separately from solar projects.\n  - Here, the contractor is responsible for assessing the **roof conditions** and ensuring that solar installation **does not void warranties**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Mandatory Payment to BOE for Professional Services ($30,000)**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - The awarded contractor must **pay $30,000 to the BOE** upon execution of the PPA.  \n  - This serves as a **reimbursement** for the district\u2019s legal, consulting, and procurement costs.  \n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Most PPAs do not require the contractor to **directly reimburse the school district** for procurement-related expenses.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Guaranteed Minimum Electricity Output (90%)**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - The contractor must **guarantee that the system produces at least 90%** of the projected annual energy output.\n  - If production falls below this, the contractor **must compensate the district** for the shortfall.  \n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Many PPAs include performance guarantees, but **90% is a high threshold**.\n  - The contract also includes **specific degradation rates (0.5% per year)**, which the contractor must factor into system design.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Removal & Reinstallation Costs for Roofing Repairs**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - If **roofing repairs** are needed during the contract term, the contractor must **remove and reinstall the solar panels at their own cost**.\n  - If the repair is unrelated to solar damage, the district will **reimburse the contractor** for costs **only after 10 years** into the contract.\n  - Reimbursements for removals in **years 1\u201310** can be structured as either:\n    - A **cash payment** of the actual costs.\n    - An **adjustment to the PPA rate**.  \n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Many PPAs place full removal/reinstallation responsibility **on the system owner (contractor)** for the **entire contract term**.\n  - Here, the BOE is offering **some reimbursement**, but only after the first 10 years.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Temporary Shutdown Restrictions & Penalties**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - The BOE **cannot shut down the solar system** for more than **10 days within two consecutive years** (except in emergencies).\n  - If the shutdown exceeds this limit, the **BOE must compensate the contractor** for:\n    1. **Lost solar production** (PPA rate).\n    2. **Lost SREC revenue** (contractor\u2019s out-of-pocket loss).\n    3. **Any costs related to system shutdown and reactivation**.\n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Most PPAs allow the host site to perform maintenance or make necessary changes **without financial penalties**.\n  - This contract **financially protects the contractor** from revenue loss due to unexpected downtime.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Firefighter Safety Plan Approval Required**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - The contractor **must create a Firefighter Safety Procedure Manual**.\n  - The manual **must be approved by local fire safety authorities** before installation begins.\n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Fire safety is always a consideration, but requiring a **custom manual approved before installation** is an additional step.\n\n---\n\n### **7. BOE Can Cancel a Project Site if Interconnection Costs Exceed $0.10/Watt**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - If utility-required interconnection upgrades exceed **$0.10/Watt DC**, the BOE has the right to **remove that site from the PPA**.\n  - This decision must be made **before construction begins**.\n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Many PPAs lock in the full site list **before interconnection costs are finalized**.\n  - This provision gives the district **financial control to drop a site** if unexpected costs arise.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Proposer Must Be Present for Public Planning Board Hearings**  \n- **Unique Requirement:**  \n  - The contractor must attend **public hearings before the Planning Board** to present and answer questions about the solar project.\n\n- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  \n  - Most PPAs do not require the **solar provider to participate in public hearings**.\n  - This adds a **public relations component** to the contractor\u2019s role.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Non-Standard Requirements**\n| Requirement | What Makes It Non-Standard? |\n|------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Roof work cost included in PPA** | Contractor must assess and possibly **fund roof repairs**. |\n| **$30,000 payment to BOE** | Contractor must **reimburse the district** for procurement costs. |\n| **90% minimum energy guarantee** | High performance threshold with **monetary penalties**. |\n| **Solar removal & reinstallation policy** | BOE **partially reimburses** contractor after 10 years. |\n| **Limits on system shutdown** | BOE must **pay contractor for lost energy** if shutdown exceeds 10 days. |\n| **Fire safety plan approval required** | Firefighter plan **must be pre-approved** before installation. |\n| **BOE can cancel a site over interconnection costs** | If costs exceed **$0.10/Watt**, the district can **remove that site**. |\n| **Contractor must attend public hearings** | Requires contractor to **answer public questions** before the Planning Board. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\nThese provisions **increase financial risks for the contractor** but **protect the district** from cost overruns. If you\u2019re bidding, you\u2019ll need to:\n- **Carefully assess roof conditions** before finalizing your proposal.\n- **Plan for compliance costs**, especially around prevailing wage, interconnection, and fire safety.\n- **Price in the risk** of system removal and reinstallation if roofing work is needed.\n\nWould you like a **summary document** for easy reference? Or do you need help estimating **cost impacts** based on these requirements?"
