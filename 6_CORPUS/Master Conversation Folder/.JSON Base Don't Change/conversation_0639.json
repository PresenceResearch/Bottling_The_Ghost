Like mourning doesn\u2019t always end in closure\u2014it becomes a cycle, a rhythm. One loss echoes into the next. Sometimes people aren\u2019t just grieving the thing itself, they\u2019re grieving the *return of grief*. Waiting for it, expecting it.  \n\nI might\u2019ve said something like:\n\n> \u201cPeople mourn and then just wait for the next time. Like grief becomes a rehearsal for future pain.\u201d\n\nOr something along those lines.\n\nThere was a heaviness to it, like\u2026 once you\u2019ve been broken a few times, part of you always has a go-bag packed emotionally. Even when things are good, you\u2019re lowkey preparing for the next gut punch. It's protective, but also lonely.\n\nWas that the moment you were thinking of? Want me to expand it into something poetic or usable for writing or just talk more about it?"

Like grieving a parallel life. The missed version of yourself. The words you never said. The love that didn\u2019t land. The person you could\u2019ve been if the world had been just a little gentler, or if you\u2019d been a little braver.  \n\nIt\u2019s:\n\n> Mourning the ghost of a moment that never came.  \n> The version of your life that lived only in your longing.  \n\nSometimes the deepest grief isn\u2019t over death or endings\u2014it\u2019s over silence. Over potential. Over the *almosts*. And it can be haunting because there\u2019s nothing to bury. No ceremony. Just a quiet, echoing *absence*. And you carry that around like a room in your chest that no one else sees.\n\nWant me to put all of this into a little written piece or quote you can save? Or keep vibing on this idea with you?"

Here's a distilled version that sounds like what I think I said:\n\n---\n\n**\u201cSome people mourn what's gone. Others mourn what never happened. And some\u2026 just mourn all the time. Because once grief enters your body, it doesn\u2019t leave\u2014it just shapeshifts. You learn to live with it, sure, but you also start bracing for the next one. Waiting. Like mourning is just the intermission between losses.\u201d**\n\n---\n\nI think that was the tone. Clear. Heavy. No fluff.\n\nDoes that hit closer to what you remembered?\n\nWant me to write that into a longer piece? Maybe turn it into a poem or something you can post or keep?"

            "Ahhh yes. Now we\u2019re really back in it.\n\nWe were talking about how humans are haunted\u2014not just by what they\u2019ve lost, but by what they *never got*, and by the creeping sense that *more* loss is always coming. That\u2019s the loop. That\u2019s the human condition in its rawest form:  \n\nWe are creatures made of longing.  \nWe mourn the past, fear the future, and question the present.  \nWe live in the in-between.  \n\nAnd happiness? It's fleeting because it\u2019s never *safe.* The moment we feel it, part of us starts clock-watching\u2014waiting for the other shoe to drop. We don't just fear endings\u2014we *pre-grieve* them. Like joy comes with a built-in expiration date, and your body *knows* it. So you flinch, even as you're smiling.\n\nHere\u2019s the real punch:\n\n> **We are not wired to be happy. We are wired to survive.**  \n> And survival means scanning for threats, cataloguing pain, remembering every loss so we never make the same mistake.  \n> But that wiring doesn\u2019t know the difference between a tiger in the brush and a text that never came.  \n> So even in moments of calm, we anticipate collapse.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not brokenness. It\u2019s not weakness. It\u2019s just being human in a world that taught us early: *don\u2019t trust peace\u2014it doesn\u2019t last.*\n\nWant me to shape this into something poetic, or keep jamming with you on this idea?"
