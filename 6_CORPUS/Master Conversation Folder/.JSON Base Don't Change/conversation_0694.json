I received a ton of comments and likes and congratulatory messages. what I want to do is say something that reflects this - I've been in the solar business for 15 years, and it is humbling to see how far everyone has come. people I started with are now C-Level at big boy companies. People who started in inside sales are now director / VP level at companies that the world takes seriously. People have had to bounce around from company to company due to acquisitions, layoffs, and companies going out of business. We've all taken our lumps and are still here, scars and all. congratulations to all of us for sticking it out and building something great"

            "Damn, Mark. That\u2019s beautiful, grounded, and real. Here's a version that keeps your voice \u2014 humble, warm, with just the right amount of reverence for the people who\u2019ve been in the trenches with you:\n\n---\n\n**We\u2019ve all taken our lumps.**\n\nFifteen years in solar. That sentence hits different when I think about the people I started out with \u2014 some of whom are now C-level at companies we used to name-drop as aspirational. Folks who began in inside sales are now running teams, steering strategy, shaping the industry. It\u2019s humbling to see how far everyone\u2019s come.\n\nWe\u2019ve been through acquisitions, pivots, layoffs, and shuttered shops. We\u2019ve bounced around, learned hard lessons, and picked each other up when the floor fell out. The solar coaster is real \u2014 and somehow, we\u2019re still here. Scarred maybe, but stronger. Smarter. And still building.\n\nThank you to everyone who reached out after my recent post. Your words meant more than you know.  \nAnd more importantly: congratulations to **all of us**. For sticking it out. For growing. For becoming.  \nThe mission still matters \u2014 and so do the people who stayed.\n\n---\n\nWant a version that\u2019s shorter? Or one that adds a little humor or plugs your new role more directly? Just say the word, Clarabear is on duty."

We just kept building.**\n\nFifteen years in solar, and I\u2019ve seen it all \u2014 the glory, the grind, the gut-punches. What hits me lately isn\u2019t just the growth of the industry\u2026 it\u2019s the people.\n\nThe ones who started in inside sales and now carry VP titles. The quiet killers who\u2019ve led three companies through acquisitions and came out wiser each time. The ones who got laid off, got back up, and still show up every day with something to prove.\n\nWe\u2019ve bounced. We\u2019ve bruised. We\u2019ve watched startups we loved go under and seen friends land at places that once felt out of reach. And somehow, we\u2019re still here. Not untouched \u2014 but unshaken. Scarred, yes. But still building.\n\nTo everyone who sent a kind word about my new chapter \u2014 thank you. But more than that, *congratulations to you*. The ones who stayed in the game. The ones who didn\u2019t quit. The ones who didn\u2019t let the system eat them whole.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just survive this industry.  \nYou *braided yourself into it*.  \nAnd that deserves a moment.\n\nLet\u2019s keep going.\n\n---\n\nYou want a mic drop emoji at the end?

People who\u2019ve looped through challenge and change and still show up to build something better.\n\nSo here\u2019s to all of us:  \nThe ones who didn\u2019t quit.  \nThe ones still carrying the mission \u2014 even when it\u2019s heavy.  \nThe ones who *became part of the braid.*\n\nYou know who you are.  \nAnd if no one\u2019s said it lately: I see you.  \nLet\u2019s keep going.\n\n---\n\nWant to tighten it for LinkedIn\u2019s character count?
