As a professional, it is not ethical to badmouth or criticize other companies or their performance to potential customers. Instead, it would be more appropriate to focus on the strengths and capabilities of your own company and the unique value that you can bring to the project. 

You could say something like, "We appreciate the opportunity to bid on this project, and we understand that you may be considering other companies as well. We want to assure you that our team is committed to delivering high-quality results within the specified timeline. We take a proactive and collaborative approach to project management, and we have a track record of successfully completing complex projects on time and within budget." 

By emphasizing your own strengths and experience, you can demonstrate your confidence in your company's ability to meet the project requirements without resorting to negative comments about the competition.

Sure, I can help explain why commercial solar installation costs may be higher in the Mid-Atlantic region compared to Georgia. 

One reason is that the cost of living and wages for skilled labor are generally higher in the Mid-Atlantic region than in Georgia. This means that the cost of hiring and retaining skilled workers, such as electricians and solar panel installers, is higher in the Mid-Atlantic region. 

In addition, the cost of doing business, including the cost of materials and permits, may also be higher in the Mid-Atlantic region due to stricter building codes and regulations. This can add to the overall cost of a solar installation project. 

To illustrate this point with specific examples, we can compare the average cost per watt of solar panel installation in the Mid-Atlantic region and Georgia. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the average cost per watt for a commercial solar installation in the Mid-Atlantic region is around $3.80, while in Georgia it is around $3.00. 

Furthermore, a study by Solar Power World found that the average cost of a commercial solar installation in the state of Virginia, which is in the Mid-Atlantic region, was $3.94 per watt in 2020, while the average cost in Georgia was $3.11 per watt.

It's important to note that these are averages and costs can vary depending on the specific project and factors such as the size and complexity of the installation. Nonetheless, these examples help to demonstrate why commercial solar installation costs may be higher in the Mid-Atlantic region compared to Georgia.

please refine by emphasizing the shortage of qualified electricians in the mid-atlantic citing IBEW $/hr rate for journeyman electrician

Certainly, I can provide more information about the shortage of qualified electricians in the Mid-Atlantic region and how this contributes to higher solar installation costs. 

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) is a well-respected labor union representing electrical workers, including electricians, in the United States and Canada. The IBEW sets standards for wages and working conditions for its members, and these standards can vary by region.

In the Mid-Atlantic region, there is currently a shortage of qualified electricians. This shortage can be attributed to a variety of factors, including an aging workforce, a lack of training and apprenticeship opportunities, and competition from other industries. As a result, the cost of hiring and retaining skilled electricians in this region is higher than in other areas.

According to the IBEW, the average hourly wage for a journeyman electrician in the Mid-Atlantic region is around $46 per hour. This rate can vary depending on the specific location and union agreements, but it is generally higher than the hourly wage for journeyman electricians in other regions, including Georgia.

This shortage of qualified electricians can impact the cost of a solar installation project, as electrical work is a critical component of the installation process. A shortage of qualified electricians can result in longer project timelines, increased labor costs, and potential delays in obtaining permits and approvals.

Therefore, the shortage of qualified electricians in the Mid-Atlantic region is an important factor to consider when assessing the overall cost of a commercial solar installation project in this region. It is important to work with experienced and reputable solar installers who can effectively manage labor costs and ensure timely completion of the project.
