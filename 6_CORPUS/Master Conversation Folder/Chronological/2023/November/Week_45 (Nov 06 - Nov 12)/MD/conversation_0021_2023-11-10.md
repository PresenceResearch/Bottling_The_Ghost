**Assistant:**

*2023-11-10 13:13:16*

Here are some quotes reflecting on the 2008 financial crisis:

1. Chrystia Freeland remarked on the lingering impact: "Sometimes, the aftermath is more devastating than the storm. That is the story of the 2008 financial crisis. It was disastrous at the time, but what has been worse is how long it has lingered"【22†source】.

2. Paul Samuelson highlighted the complexity and unknowns of the crisis: "What we know about the global financial crisis is that we don't know very much"【22†source】.

3. Barack Obama pointed to the root causes: "Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did"【22†source】.

These reflections underscore the multifaceted nature of the crisis and its long-term effects on society and the economy.

Certainly, here are additional quotes on the 2008 financial crisis:

4. John Kennedy stressed the public's memory of the bailouts: "I bet taxpayers remember providing more than $812 billion to Citigroup and Bank of America, two Wall Street banks, in 2009 to bail them out during the 2008 financial crisis. Taxpayers remember that generosity; big banks evidently don't"【22†source】.

5. George W. Bush cautioned against using the crisis as a pretext to increase taxes: "The financial crisis should not become an excuse to raise taxes, which would only undermine the economic growth required to regain our strength"【22†source】.

6. Paul Polman suggested the crisis revealed a moral deficit: "I believe that the financial crisis of 2008/9 exposed more a lack of ethics and morality - especially by the financial sector - rather than a problem of regulation or criminality"【22†source】.

7. Michael Spence talked about the prolonged recovery: "There is no question that the recovery from the global recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis has been unusually lengthy and anemic"【22†source】.

These insights provide a range of perspectives, from criticism of financial institutions and regulatory frameworks to reflections on the broader economic and moral implications of the crisis.

Here are some memorable quotes from the movie "Margin Call":

1. Will Emerson: "People wanna live like this with their cars and big f***in' houses they can't even pay for, then you're necessary... if all of this goes tits up they're gonna crucify us for being too reckless but if we're wrong, and everything gets back on track?... they're gonna laugh till they piss their pants"【36†source】.

2. John Tuld: "There are three ways to make a living in this business: be first, be smarter, or cheat"【36†source】.
