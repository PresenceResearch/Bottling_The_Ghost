You've shared an image of an old record label. It's from Banner Records, which was a popular label during the early part of the 20th century, often producing budget-priced records. The record is titled "Paddlin' Madelin' Home" by Eddie Peabody, with a banjo solo, vocal, and chorus by Arthur Hall. The Plaza Music Company in New York was involved in its production. This particular record looks like a 78 RPM, which was the standard for records at the time.

Banner Records was active during the 1920s and 1930s, and "Paddlin' Madelin' Home" is a song that dates from the mid-1920s. Since Eddie Peabody was known as a prominent banjo player during that era, it's likely that this record was released sometime in the 1920s. Without specific catalog numbers or additional records to cross-reference, it's difficult to give an exact year, but it's certainly from that period.
