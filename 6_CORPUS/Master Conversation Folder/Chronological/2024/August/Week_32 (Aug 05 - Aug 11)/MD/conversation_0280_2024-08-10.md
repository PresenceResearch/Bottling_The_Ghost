The best app for pulling all travel data together is often considered to be **TripIt**. TripIt excels at consolidating travel information from various sources, such as airlines, hotels, car rentals, and more, into a single, comprehensive itinerary. Here’s why TripIt is highly regarded:

### Key Features:
1. **Automatic Import of Travel Plans**: TripIt automatically imports travel details from your email confirmations and organizes them into a master itinerary.
   
2. **Centralized Itinerary**: All your travel details—flights, hotels, car rentals, and even restaurant reservations—are combined into one easy-to-read itinerary that you can access on your phone, tablet, or computer.

3. **Calendar Syncing**: TripIt can sync with your calendar (Google, Apple, Outlook, etc.), ensuring that your travel plans are integrated with your personal schedule.

4. **Proactive Alerts**: If you opt for TripIt Pro (a paid upgrade), you receive real-time alerts about flight delays, cancellations, gate changes, and even better seat availability.

5. **Team Sharing**: Easily share your itinerary with colleagues, family, or friends, making it ideal for business or group travel.

6. **Integration with Other Services**: TripIt integrates with apps like Uber, Lyft, Google Assistant, Slack, and more to streamline your travel experience.

7. **Maps and Directions**: Provides maps and directions for each segment of your trip, including airport terminal maps.

### Alternatives:
- **Google Trips (now integrated into Google Travel)**: Google’s travel service pulls together flights, hotel bookings, and activity suggestions but is more focused on trip planning and suggestions rather than detailed itinerary management.
  
- **Kayak**: Offers a similar service to TripIt but is more focused on price tracking and booking rather than organizing existing travel plans.

- **App in the Air**: Specializes in flight tracking but also organizes other travel details.

For most users, **TripIt** remains the go-to app for consolidating travel information from various sources into one streamlined and organized itinerary.
