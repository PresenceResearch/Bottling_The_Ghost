When you install a new eSIM on your phone, your Apple ID and iMessage/FaceTime services might not automatically associate with it. Here’s what you can do to ensure your Apple ID is associated with your new eSIM:

1. **Check Your Settings**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Cellular** (or **Mobile Data**) and make sure your eSIM is active.
   - Ensure that your eSIM is selected as the default line for data usage.

2. **Sign In to iMessage and FaceTime**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Messages** > **Send & Receive**. Here, make sure your phone number associated with the eSIM is checked.
   - If your new number is not listed, tap on **Use your Apple ID for iMessage** and sign in with your Apple ID.
   - Repeat the process for FaceTime under **Settings** > **FaceTime**.

3. **Restart Your Phone**:
   - Sometimes a simple restart can help your phone associate the Apple ID with the new eSIM.

4. **Apple ID Verification**:
   - Make sure you're signed in to your Apple ID in **Settings** > **[Your Name]** at the top. If you're signed in, your phone should automatically associate the Apple ID with the new eSIM.

If you continue to experience issues, you may need to sign out of your Apple ID and sign back in. This sometimes forces the phone to reconfigure its association with the new eSIM.

I am in Japan and I have a Verizon phone from the US. I have purchased and installed a Japanese eSIM. If I turn data roaming off on Verizon will I be using the eSIM data and not the Verizon data?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes, if you turn data roaming off for your Verizon line, your phone will use the data from the Japanese eSIM instead of Verizon's data.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Data Roaming Off**: When you turn off data roaming for your Verizon line, your phone will not use any data from Verizon's network, even if you are connected to their network for calls or texts.

2. **Using the Japanese eSIM for Data**:
   - Make sure your Japanese eSIM is set as the default line for data. To check this, go to **Settings** > **Cellular** (or **Mobile Data**) > **Cellular Data** and select the Japanese eSIM.
   - Your phone will now use the data from the Japanese eSIM whenever you're using mobile data.

3. **Verify Cellular Data Usage**:
   - You can also confirm that your phone is using the Japanese eSIM for data by checking the data usage in **Settings** > **Cellular** > **Cellular Data Usage**. It should reflect data usage under the Japanese eSIM.

By doing this, you ensure that you avoid incurring any unexpected data charges from Verizon while using your Japanese eSIM for mobile data.
