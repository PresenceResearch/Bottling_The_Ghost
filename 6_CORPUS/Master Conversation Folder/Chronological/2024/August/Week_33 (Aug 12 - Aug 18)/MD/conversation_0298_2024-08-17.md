Yes, in Japan, each university typically has its own entrance exam, especially for private universities. These exams are tailored to the specific requirements of each university and its departments. 

Public universities, particularly the national ones, often use a two-step process that includes the standardized national exam called the "Center Test" (or "Common Test" as it's now called) followed by the university's own specific entrance exam. Private universities generally rely on their own entrance exams without using the national exam.

The entrance exams can vary significantly in content and difficulty depending on the university and the faculty or department within the university. For example, the exams for medical schools are usually more challenging and specialized than those for other departments.

Students often prepare extensively for these exams by studying specific guides or textbooks like the ones in the image you provided.
