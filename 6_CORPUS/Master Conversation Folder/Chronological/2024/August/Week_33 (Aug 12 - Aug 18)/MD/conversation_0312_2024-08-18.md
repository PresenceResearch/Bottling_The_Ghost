---

**Assistant:**

The flags you see over the doors of restaurants in Japan are called **"のれん" (noren)**. Noren are traditional Japanese fabric dividers, typically hung in doorways or windows of shops, restaurants, and other establishments. They serve several purposes:

1. **Indicate that the shop is open**: When the noren is hung out, it usually signifies that the establishment is open for business. When the noren is taken down, it indicates that the shop is closed.

2. **Branding and decoration**: Noren often feature the shop's name, logo, or symbols related to the business, serving as a form of signage and branding. They also add to the aesthetic appeal of the entrance.

3. **Privacy and protection**: Noren provide a sense of privacy for customers inside the shop by partially shielding the interior from outside view. They also offer some protection from the elements, such as sun, wind, or dust.

4. **Cultural significance**: Noren have a deep cultural significance and are associated with the spirit of Japanese hospitality (おもてなし, omotenashi). They create a welcoming atmosphere and are part of the traditional Japanese approach to customer service.

Overall, noren are both practical and symbolic, contributing to the atmosphere and identity of the establishment.
