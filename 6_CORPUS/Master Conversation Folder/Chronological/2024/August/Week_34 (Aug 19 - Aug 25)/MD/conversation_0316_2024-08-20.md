**Shochu** (焼酎) is a traditional Japanese distilled spirit that is often compared to whiskey or vodka in terms of its production process and alcohol content. It is typically made from a variety of ingredients, including barley, sweet potatoes, rice, buckwheat, and even brown sugar. The base ingredient used often determines the flavor profile of the shochu.

Shochu is different from sake, which is a fermented rice wine. Shochu has a higher alcohol content, usually ranging between 25% and 45%, depending on the type and how it's distilled. It can be consumed in several ways, including straight, on the rocks, diluted with water, or mixed into cocktails.

There are two main types of shochu:

1. **Korui Shochu** (甲類焼酎): This is a more refined and purer form of shochu, often distilled multiple times, resulting in a cleaner taste. It's commonly used in mixed drinks and cocktails.

2. **Otsurui Shochu** (乙類焼酎): This type is single-distilled, which preserves more of the flavors of the base ingredients. It has a more complex taste and is often enjoyed neat or on the rocks.

Shochu is particularly popular in the southern regions of Japan, such as Kyushu, and is enjoyed both as a casual drink and in formal settings.
