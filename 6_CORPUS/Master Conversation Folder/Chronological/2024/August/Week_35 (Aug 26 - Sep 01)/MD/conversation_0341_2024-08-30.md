Bundling these services directly isn't typically an option since they are offered by different companies. However, here are some steps you can take to potentially save money or manage these subscriptions more efficiently:

### 1. **Review Available Bundles:**
   - **Apple One Premier:** You already have this, and it includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+, Apple Fitness+, and Apple News+. Since you already use Spotify, you could consider switching to Apple Music for a similar music service.
   - **Hulu Bundles:** Hulu offers bundles with Disney+ and ESPN+. While this doesn’t include your other subscriptions, it could offer savings if you’re interested in these services.
   - **Mobile Carrier Bundles:** Check with your mobile carrier (e.g., Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile) as they sometimes offer discounts or bundles on services like Netflix, Apple Music, Hulu, or even MAX.

### 2. **Credit Card or Bank Offers:**
   - Some credit cards offer cashback, discounts, or points for streaming services. Check if your card provides any such benefits.

### 3. **Manage Subscriptions Centrally:**
   - Use a subscription management app (like **Truebill** or **Mint**) to keep track of billing dates, find any additional savings opportunities, or get notifications about price increases.

### 4. **Annual Billing:**
   - Some services offer a discount for annual billing instead of monthly. Consider switching to annual billing for services you are certain you will use for a year.

### 5. **Family Sharing:**
   - Use family sharing options for Apple One and Spotify Family Premium to share costs with family or friends.

does option 4 contain ads?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-08-30 07:17:11*

Yes, the Hulu + HBO Max bundle can contain ads, depending on the Hulu plan you choose. 

- If you choose the **Hulu (ad-supported) plan** starting at $7.99 per month, you will have ads on Hulu content.
- If you opt for the **Hulu (No Ads) plan**, you will pay more, but Hulu content will be ad-free. However, the HBO Max portion of the bundle is ad-free at $14.99 per month, which is the ad-free version of HBO Max.

So, if you want a completely ad-free experience, you would need to select both the Hulu (No Ads) plan and the ad-free version of HBO Max.
