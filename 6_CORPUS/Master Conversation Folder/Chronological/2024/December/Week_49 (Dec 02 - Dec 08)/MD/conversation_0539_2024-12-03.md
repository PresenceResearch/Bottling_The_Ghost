This watch appears to be a vintage or custom-made piece styled to resemble a Rolex. Based on the design:

1. **Dial:** The dial is simple with large numerals and a small seconds subdial, which is atypical for modern Rolex watches but can be found in older or custom models.
2. **Movement:** The movement visible through the case back is ornately engraved, which is unusual for standard Rolex watches but is a feature sometimes found in modified or custom watches.
3. **Case Back:** The transparent case back showcasing the movement is uncommon for Rolex, as most genuine Rolex watches have solid case backs.

This could be:
- A vintage Rolex pocket watch movement repurposed into a wristwatch (a common practice).
- A homage or custom-built piece with a Rolex-style dial and branding but not a genuine Rolex.

If you're looking for authentication or appraisal, I recommend consulting a professional watchmaker or Rolex expert.

iturn0image0The watch in question is a vintage Rolex pocket watch that has been converted into a wristwatch—a practice known as a "marriage watch." This involves taking the movement and dial from an antique pocket watch and placing them into a newly crafted wristwatch case. This approach allows for the preservation and continued use of historical timepieces in a more contemporary and wearable form.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Movement:** The watch features a vintage Rolex movement, likely from the early 20th century, as indicated by the ornate engravings and design typical of that era.

- **Dial:** The dial maintains the classic aesthetic of vintage Rolex pocket watches, with large numerals and a small seconds subdial.

- **Case:** The new wristwatch case is designed to accommodate the original pocket watch movement and dial, often crafted to match the vintage style.

**Considerations:**

- **Authenticity:** While the movement and dial are genuine vintage Rolex components, the case is newly made. This means the watch is not an original Rolex wristwatch but a combination of authentic and custom-made parts.

- **Value:** The value of such converted watches can vary. Collectors may appreciate the historical aspects of the movement and dial, but the non-original case can affect the overall valuation.

- **Maintenance:** Servicing vintage movements can be more complex and may require a watchmaker experienced with antique timepieces.

If you're considering purchasing or valuing this watch, it's advisable to consult with a professional watchmaker or appraiser who specializes in vintage timepieces to get a comprehensive understanding of its authenticity, condition, and worth.
