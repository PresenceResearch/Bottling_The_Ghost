The UL (Underwriters Laboratories) requirement that addresses the removal of electronic equipment from solar modules typically relates to **UL 61730**, which governs the safety standards for photovoltaic (PV) modules. This standard focuses on the construction, durability, and electrical safety of solar modules.

Key points regarding the removal of electronic equipment from solar modules:

1. **Simplification for Certification**: Modules without embedded electronics, such as microinverters or power optimizers, are generally simpler to test and certify under UL 61730. Embedded electronics may require additional certifications, such as **UL 1741** for inverters or converters.

2. **Fire Safety Classification**: Modules with integrated electronics must meet stricter fire safety standards and testing. Removing electronics may streamline compliance with UL fire safety classifications.

3. **Electrical Isolation**: UL 61730 requires robust insulation and isolation to ensure safety. Removing embedded electronics eliminates potential points of electrical failure or short circuits.

4. **Durability and Weather Resistance**: Modules without electronics are tested as standalone devices under environmental conditions (e.g., hail, UV exposure, and thermal cycling). Embedded electronics require separate environmental testing.

5. **Maintenance and Repair**: By removing electronics, the modules avoid issues such as electronics degradation or failure, reducing maintenance complexity and ensuring compliance with UL standards for expected lifetime performance.

6. **Compatibility with External Systems**: The standard emphasizes compatibility with external systems (e.g., separate inverters), and separating electronics ensures that the modules focus solely on power generation.

If your goal is to understand specific UL requirements for modules with or without embedded electronics, I recommend reviewing the latest version of UL 61730 and related documents (like UL 1741) for precise compliance criteria.

To clarify the UL requirements regarding the removal of electronic equipment from solar modules, here’s a refined explanation:

---

### UL Standards Relevant to Solar Modules and Embedded Electronics:

1. **UL 61730: Safety for Photovoltaic (PV) Modules**  
   - This standard focuses on ensuring the safety of PV modules through testing their construction, electrical insulation, and durability against environmental conditions.
   - **Modules without embedded electronics** (like microinverters or power optimizers) have a simpler certification process under UL 61730 since the scope of testing is limited to the module itself.

2. **UL 1741: Standard for Inverters, Converters, Controllers, and Interconnection System Equipment**  
   - When electronic equipment is integrated into the module (e.g., microinverters or optimizers), UL 1741 certification applies. This involves additional testing for performance, reliability, and safety in power electronics.

---

### Benefits of Removing Embedded Electronics:

1. **Streamlined Compliance**:  
   - PV modules without electronics are tested only against the physical and electrical standards outlined in UL 61730, avoiding the additional requirements of UL 1741. This simplifies the compliance process.

2. **Fire Safety (UL 61730-2)**:  
   - Fire testing is more straightforward for modules without electronics. Integrated electronics require rigorous testing for thermal performance and fault scenarios.

3. **Environmental Durability**:  
   - Modules without embedded electronics are subject to standard environmental tests (e.g., thermal cycling, humidity, hail, UV exposure). Electronics embedded in modules require additional testing to ensure that they can withstand these same conditions.

4. **Maintenance and Longevity**:  
   - Removing electronics reduces failure points within the module, leading to improved reliability over the module’s lifespan. Failures in embedded electronics can be harder to diagnose and repair.

5. **Flexibility in System Design**:  
   - Modules without embedded electronics can pair with any compatible external inverter or optimizer. This provides system designers greater flexibility and simplifies inventory management.

---

### Key Considerations:

- If the removal of electronics is being considered for certification purposes, **UL 61730-1 and UL 61730-2** will remain the primary applicable standards.
- For modules already certified with embedded electronics, the removal of those components will likely require re-certification under the revised configuration.

The certification standard for photovoltaic (PV) modules **without embedded electronics** is **UL 61730**. This standard ensures the safety and performance of solar modules by focusing on their construction, materials, and operational integrity without considering additional embedded electronic components.

### Key Details of **UL 61730**:

1. **Scope**:  
   - Applies to PV modules without integrated electronics (e.g., microinverters, power optimizers).
   - Covers safety aspects such as electrical shock, fire hazards, and mechanical stability.

2. **Parts of the Standard**:  
   - **UL 61730-1**: Construction and materials safety.
   - **UL 61730-2**: Testing methods for module durability and environmental conditions.

3. **Focus Areas**:  
   - **Electrical Insulation**: Ensures adequate insulation to prevent electrical shock.
   - **Fire Resistance**: Verifies that the module can resist ignition and does not propagate flames.
   - **Durability Testing**: Includes thermal cycling, humidity-freeze, and hail impact tests.

4. **Fire Classification**:  
   - PV modules are classified under specific fire safety ratings, such as Type 1, 2, or 3, based on UL 61730-2 testing.

### Why **UL 61730** for Modules Without Electronics?

Modules without embedded electronics are solely assessed for their ability to generate and deliver power safely and reliably. They do not require additional standards like **UL 1741** (which applies to inverters, converters, and interconnection equipment) because they lack power electronics.

### Related Standards:

- **IEC 61730**: International equivalent to UL 61730, often required for global compliance.
- **UL 1703**: The predecessor to UL 61730, now largely replaced by the latter.

If you're certifying PV modules for North American markets, focus on compliance with **UL 61730**. If you're targeting international markets, ensure alignment with **IEC 61730** as well. Let me know if you'd like guidance on the certification process or specific testing requirements!
