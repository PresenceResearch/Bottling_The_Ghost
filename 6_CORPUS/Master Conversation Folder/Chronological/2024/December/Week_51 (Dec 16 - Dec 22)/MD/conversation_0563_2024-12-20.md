The original lyrics to "Maryland, My Maryland," written by James Ryder Randall in 1861, were inspired by the Civil War and are written from a Confederate perspective. The song was adopted as Maryland's state song in 1939 but was repealed as the state song in 2021 due to its controversial and divisive content.

Here is the text of the original lyrics:

---

**Maryland, My Maryland**  
The despot's heel is on thy shore,  
Maryland!  
His torch is at thy temple door,  
Maryland!  
Avenge the patriotic gore  
That flecked the streets of Baltimore,  
And be the battle queen of yore,  
Maryland! My Maryland!

Hark! 'Tis the watchman's honest cry,  
Maryland!  
From hill to hill, from vale to vale,  
Maryland!  
Virginia should not call in vain,  
Maryland!  
She meets her sisters on the plain—  
Sic semper! 'tis the proud refrain  
That baffles minions back amain,  
Maryland! My Maryland!

I see the blush upon thy cheek,  
Maryland!  
For thou wast ever bravely meek,  
Maryland!  
But lo! There surges forth a shriek  
From hill to hill, from creek to creek,  
Potomac calls to Chesapeake,  
Maryland! My Maryland!

Thou wilt not cower in the dust,  
Maryland!  
Thy beaming sword shall never rust,  
Maryland!  
Remember Carroll's sacred trust,  
Remember Howard's warlike thrust,—  
And all thy slumberers with the just,  
Maryland! My Maryland!

Come! 'tis the red dawn of the day,  
Maryland!  
Come with thy panoplied array,  
Maryland!  
With Ringgold's spirit for the fray,  
With Watson's blood at Monterey,  
With fearless Lowe and dashing May,  
Maryland! My Maryland!

Dear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain,  
Maryland!  
Virginia should not call in vain,  
Maryland!  
She meets her sisters on the plain—  
Sic semper! 'tis the proud refrain  
That baffles minions back amain,  
Maryland! My Maryland!

The song is set to the melody of "O Tannenbaum" and was controversial because of its explicit Confederate sympathies and use of language calling for resistance against the Union during the Civil War.
