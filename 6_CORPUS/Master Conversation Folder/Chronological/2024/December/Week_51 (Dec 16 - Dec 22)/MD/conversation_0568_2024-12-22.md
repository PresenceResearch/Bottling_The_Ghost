I’m mapping out a sales cycle for a commercial solar division. Right now the steps are pre discovery, discovery call, solutions call, sales process ongoing, LOI, and contract review. 

I’m struggling to determine how I should time these. In a perfect world I want to know what leads are being worked but not yet opportunities, how many discovery calls are scheduled; how many solutions calls are scheduled, and then what the sales cycle looks like after that. Sales process ongoing is too vague for
Me since the sales process can be a month or 6 months or a year. These are different deals as far as I’m concerned and I want to know which deals are fast tracked and what deals take a long time. Then I want to know how many deals are under LOI, and am not sure what percentage close rate I should use for them.  What is the best way to categorize them so I can get a good idea of what the pipeline looks like at a glance?

Mapping out your sales cycle to achieve pipeline clarity requires thoughtful structuring and well-defined stages. Here's a framework that can help you effectively organize and categorize your sales pipeline, along with strategies for timing and metrics.

---

### **Refined Sales Stages**
1. **Pre-Discovery (Lead Qualification)**
   - **Goal:** Qualify the lead before scheduling a discovery call.
   - **Activities:** Initial outreach, gathering preliminary information, and basic qualification.
   - **Pipeline Metrics:** Number of leads worked but not yet opportunities.
   - **Tracking Tool:** "Pre-Opportunity" or "Lead Qualification" bucket in your CRM.

2. **Discovery Call**
   - **Goal:** Assess the client’s needs, decision-making process, and project feasibility.
   - **Activities:** Initial consultation, MEDPICC framework application.
   - **Pipeline Metrics:** Number of discovery calls scheduled and completed.

3. **Solutions Call (Proposal Stage)**
   - **Goal:** Present tailored solutions and address objections.
   - **Activities:** Delivering a proposal, discussing pricing, and refining the project scope.
   - **Pipeline Metrics:** Number of proposals sent and number of solutions calls scheduled.

4. **Sales Process Ongoing (Segmented Based on Timeline)**
   - Break this vague stage into **specific subcategories**:
     - **Fast Track (<3 months):** Deals with immediate timelines or lower complexity.
     - **Mid-Cycle (3-6 months):** Medium complexity, financing discussions in progress.
     - **Long-Cycle (>6 months):** Larger, more complex deals requiring extensive approvals or permitting.
   - **Pipeline Metrics:** Number of deals in each timeline bucket and progression rate.

5. **LOI (Letter of Intent) Stage**
   - **Goal:** Formalize intent to proceed and align on terms.
   - **Activities:** Obtaining LOI, confirming preliminary financial commitments.
   - **Pipeline Metrics:** Number of LOIs signed and LOI-to-close conversion rates.
   - **Close Rate:** Typically 60-80%, but adjust based on historical data and industry norms.

6. **Contract Review and Close**
   - **Goal:** Finalize and sign the contract.
   - **Activities:** Negotiating final terms, preparing for execution.
   - **Pipeline Metrics:** Contracts under review, contracts signed, and time to close.

---

### **Best Categorization for Pipeline Visibility**
1. **Status-Based Categorization**
   - Leads: Pre-discovery, qualified but not yet opportunities.
   - Opportunities: Discovery → Proposal → Ongoing sales process.
   - Contracts: LOI → Contract review → Closed.

2. **Time-Based Categorization**
   - Short-Term (<3 months): Leads likely to close soon.
   - Mid-Term (3-6 months): Deals with moderate timelines.
   - Long-Term (>6 months): Deals with extensive timelines.

3. **Deal Type Categorization**
   - Based on complexity: Standard vs. Custom projects.
   - Based on size: Small (under X kW), Medium, Large.

---

### **Key Pipeline Metrics**
- **Pre-Discovery Metrics:** Number of new leads, lead qualification rate.
- **Discovery Metrics:** Discovery call rate, discovery-to-opportunity conversion.
- **Solutions Metrics:** Proposal volume, acceptance rate, time to solution.
- **Sales Process Metrics:** Deals by timeline (fast track, mid-cycle, long-cycle), stage velocity.
- **LOI Metrics:** LOIs obtained, LOI-to-close conversion rate.
- **Contract Metrics:** Deals under contract, close rate, time to close.

---

### **Using Tools for Pipeline Management**
1. **CRM Integration**
   - Use tools like Salesforce or HubSpot to visualize the pipeline by stage.
   - Add custom fields for "Projected Close Date," "Timeline Category," and "Deal Complexity."

2. **Automated Reporting**
   - Schedule weekly or monthly reports summarizing:
     - Lead counts by stage.
     - Average time spent in each stage.
     - Conversion rates between stages.

3. **Heatmap or Dashboard**
   - Create a dashboard showing:
     - Pipeline by stage (bar chart).
     - Deals by timeline (short, mid, long-term).
     - Conversion rates (funnel view).

---

### **Improving Close Rate Accuracy**
- Start with an average close rate (e.g., 60% for LOIs) but adjust based on:
  - Historical performance.
  - Lead quality (scored during discovery).
  - Deal type and complexity.

Regularly analyze won/lost data to refine your close rate assumptions over time.

---

By organizing your sales pipeline into well-defined stages and tracking metrics for each, you'll get a clear snapshot of deal status, timelines, and opportunities at a glance. This structure will also help you identify bottlenecks and forecast revenue with greater accuracy.

Should I be focused on discovery calls scheduled or completed?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-22 11:50:33*

You should focus on **both discovery calls scheduled and completed**, but for slightly different purposes:

---

### **Why Focus on Discovery Calls Scheduled?**
1. **Pipeline Health Indicator**:  
   - The number of scheduled calls reflects how actively your team is generating interest and qualifying leads.
   - It acts as an early warning system. If scheduled calls drop, your pipeline might dry up down the line.

2. **Forecasting Opportunities**:  
   - A steady flow of scheduled discovery calls indicates consistent lead generation efforts, which helps forecast future opportunities.

3. **Activity Management**:  
   - Monitoring scheduled calls ensures your team is prioritizing outreach and filling their calendars effectively.

---

### **Why Focus on Discovery Calls Completed?**
1. **Opportunity Conversion Rate**:  
   - Completed discovery calls are the true indicator of how many leads are actively being converted into opportunities.
   - A high drop-off rate between scheduled and completed calls could point to issues (e.g., poor lead quality, scheduling conflicts).

2. **Pipeline Quality**:  
   - Scheduled calls mean nothing if they don’t happen. Completed calls show real engagement and the potential for deals.

3. **Sales Team Effectiveness**:  
   - Tracking completion rates helps assess whether your team is effectively engaging prospects and minimizing no-shows.

---

### **How to Balance the Focus?**
1. **Use Scheduled Calls as a Leading Metric**:  
   - Regularly track how many discovery calls are on the calendar. If this number dips, it signals a need for more prospecting.

2. **Use Completed Calls as a Lagging Metric**:  
   - Completed calls are a better indicator of pipeline quality and progress. Compare them against scheduled calls to measure efficiency.

---

### **Key Metrics to Track**
1. **Scheduled-to-Completed Rate**:  
   - Aim for 70-90% completion, depending on your industry and typical prospect behavior.
   - If the rate is low, investigate:
     - Lead qualification.
     - Scheduling practices.
     - Prospect engagement.

2. **Discovery-to-Opportunity Conversion Rate**:  
   - What percentage of completed calls turn into active opportunities? Use this to refine your lead qualification and focus.

---

### **Pro Tip**: Automate Follow-Ups
- Use tools like Calendly, HubSpot, or Salesforce to send reminders and confirmations to minimize no-shows.
- Add flexibility for rescheduling to ensure calls happen even if there’s a conflict.

Focusing on both scheduled and completed calls will give you a full picture of your pipeline health and sales team's performance. Prioritize **scheduled calls for forecasting** and **completed calls for results**.

   - Breaking "sales process ongoing" into timeline buckets gives you insight into deal velocity and complexity.  

2. **Metrics at Every Stage**:  
   - By assigning KPIs to each step, you’ll have better visibility into bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

3. **Adaptability**:  
   - If one segment (e.g., discovery → solutions) underperforms, you can tweak your process or training to fix it.

4. **Forecasting**:  
   - This structure makes it easier to predict revenue by analyzing deals in various stages and timelines.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Implement in CRM**:  
   - Set up these stages as pipeline categories in your CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.).  
   - Include custom fields for "timeline category" and "probability of close."  

2. **Weekly Review**:  
   - Analyze metrics for each stage in regular pipeline reviews with your team.

3. **Refine Over Time**:  
   - Track historical performance and adjust stages, timelines, and metrics as your process evolves.

This framework will provide a crystal-clear view of your pipeline, ensuring you can prioritize and manage deals effectively while accurately forecasting revenue.
