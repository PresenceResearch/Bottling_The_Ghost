My wife bit her bottom lip this morning and it started to slightly swell. She took valtrex, alleve, Benadryl and ibuprofen, hoping to fend off a herpes outbreak and swelling. Her entire bottom lip is fully swollen at this point. What happened?

It sounds like your wife’s lip swelling could be due to a combination of trauma (from biting her lip) and a possible allergic reaction or inflammatory response. Here are some possibilities to consider:

1. **Trauma and Inflammation**: 
   - When she bit her lip, it may have caused localized trauma, which can lead to swelling as the body initiates a healing response.

2. **Allergic Reaction**:
   - Taking multiple medications (Valtrex, Aleve, Benadryl, and ibuprofen) might have triggered an allergic or adverse reaction, especially if she has a sensitivity to any of these.

3. **Herpes Outbreak**:
   - If she has a history of oral herpes (cold sores), the trauma from biting her lip might have triggered an outbreak, causing the area to swell. However, Valtrex should help suppress this.

4. **Infection**:
   - A bite on the lip can introduce bacteria, potentially leading to an infection. Rapid swelling could indicate an early stage of cellulitis or another bacterial infection.

5. **Angioedema**:
   - Benadryl usually helps with allergic reactions, but sometimes a more severe form of swelling, called angioedema, can occur, possibly as a side effect of one of the medications or from the bite.

### What to Do Next:
- **Apply a Cold Compress**: This can reduce swelling and provide some relief.
- **Monitor Breathing**: If she has any difficulty breathing, swelling in other areas (like the tongue or throat), or feels faint, **seek emergency medical attention immediately**.
- **Avoid Additional Medications**: Adding more medications without guidance could worsen the situation. 
- **Consult a Doctor**: If the swelling persists or worsens, call her doctor. They may prescribe a stronger anti-inflammatory, antihistamine, or antibiotic if an infection is suspected.

If there’s a history of severe allergic reactions, have her keep an epinephrine auto-injector (like an EpiPen) nearby, just in case.
