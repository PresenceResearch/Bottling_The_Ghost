The solar accelerated depreciation schedule is indeed changing. Previously, businesses could depreciate 100% of the cost basis in the first year for property acquired after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. However, starting from 2023, this benefit began to decrease by 20% each year, reaching 60% in 2024. This trend will continue, dropping to 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and eventually phasing out to 0% by 2027. Despite this step-down, businesses can still depreciate the full cost basis, but the amount exceeding the first-year accelerated depreciation will follow the five-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) schedule【5†source】【7†source】.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law on August 16, 2022, did not directly impact the bonus depreciation but did introduce changes that will affect accelerated depreciation deductions for large corporations through the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). The bonus depreciation percentage allowed for businesses to write off qualified equipment costs in the year it is placed into service is scheduled to decrease annually, aligning with the phase-out of the accelerated depreciation schedule【6†source】.

Commercial solar installations benefit significantly from these tax incentives, including the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC) and accelerated depreciation. For example, in 2024, businesses can take advantage of 60% bonus depreciation in the first year at the federal level for commercial solar systems, with the remaining balance following the five-year MACRS schedule. State-level depreciation benefits will also follow the standard five-year MACRS schedule. This schedule facilitates substantial tax savings and promotes shorter payback periods and higher returns on investment for businesses investing in solar energy【7†source】.

Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and/or software purchased or financed during the tax year, essentially enabling businesses to lower their taxable income by the cost of the acquired assets. For the taxable year 2024, the limit for Section 179 deductions has been set at $1,220,000, with the phase-out threshold starting at $3,050,000 in equipment purchases. This means that the full deduction is available up to the specified limit, beyond which it begins to reduce dollar-for-dollar, eliminating completely once equipment purchases exceed the phase-out threshold【13†source】.

Furthermore, there have been discussions and proposals aimed at expanding and adjusting various tax provisions, including Section 179. One notable development includes proposals to extend and modify deductions and credits relevant to businesses. For instance, there's a proposal to extend 100% bonus depreciation for property placed in service through 2025, with the phase-down schedule to begin in 2026 as planned previously. This change aims to encourage more immediate capital investment by allowing businesses to fully expense qualifying property in the year it's placed in service【15†source】.

Additionally, changes are being considered for the deductibility of research and experimentation (R&E) expenses and business interest expenses under Sections 174 and 163(j), respectively. These adjustments are intended to provide relief and flexibility for businesses in managing their taxable income and deductions. For example, the proposal suggests allowing immediate deduction of domestic R&E expenses through 2025, with foreign R&E expenses continuing to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years【15†source】.

Overall, these potential changes under consideration aim to encourage investment and innovation by providing tax incentives for businesses to invest in equipment, property, and research activities. Businesses interested in taking advantage of these deductions should closely monitor legislative developments and consult with tax professionals to understand how these changes may affect their tax planning and financial decisions.

would this apply to solar panels

The eligibility of solar panels for deductions under Section 179 or the bonus depreciation provisions depends on whether they are considered "qualifying property" under the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, solar panels and other renewable energy equipment can qualify for both Section 179 deductions and bonus depreciation if they are used for business purposes.

Under Section 179, businesses are allowed to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment, which may include solar panels, up to a certain limit. This provision is designed to encourage businesses to invest in equipment, including energy-efficient or renewable energy systems, by offering an immediate expense deduction that can reduce taxable income.

Bonus depreciation rules, which have been modified over time, allow businesses to deduct a significant portion of the purchase price of new property that is placed in service during the tax year. Solar panels could qualify for bonus depreciation, allowing businesses to accelerate the depreciation deductions, thus reducing taxable income more significantly in the year the solar panels are installed.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and subsequent legislation have expanded and extended the applicability of these deductions, including for renewable energy investments. For solar panels and related equipment, this means businesses can potentially recover costs more quickly through these tax incentives.

However, specific rules about limits, phase-outs, and eligibility criteria can change, so it's crucial for businesses considering investing in solar panels or other renewable energy sources to consult with a tax professional. This ensures they fully understand the current tax implications, how to maximize potential tax benefits, and comply with all IRS requirements.

Given the details provided about Section 179 and bonus depreciation changes, it is advisable to review the latest IRS guidelines or consult with a tax advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date advice regarding the tax treatment of solar panel installations for your business.
