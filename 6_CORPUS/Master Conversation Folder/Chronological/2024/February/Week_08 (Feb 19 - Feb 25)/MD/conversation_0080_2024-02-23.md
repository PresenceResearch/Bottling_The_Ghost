The text on the sweatshirt is Arabic, and it says "عيد أضحى مبارك" which translates to "Blessed Eid al-Adha". Eid al-Adha is an Islamic festival to commemorate the willingness of Ibrahim (also known as Abraham) to follow Allah's (God's) command to sacrifice his son. Muslims around the world observe this event.
