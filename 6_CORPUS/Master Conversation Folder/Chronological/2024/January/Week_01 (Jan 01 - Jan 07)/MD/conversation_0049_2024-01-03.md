"Pitch Anything" by Oren Klaff presents a method for delivering effective pitches, particularly in high-stakes business settings. Key methodologies and concepts in the book include:

1. **The STRONG Method:** This is an acronym that stands for Setting the Frame, Telling the Story, Revealing the Intrigue, Offering the Prize, Nailing the Hookpoint, and Getting a Decision. This structure is designed to create and maintain interest throughout the pitch.

2. **Framing:** Klaff emphasizes the importance of 'frame control' in pitches. A 'frame' is the perspective through which a situation is viewed. He explains how different frames (e.g., power frame, time frame, intrigue frame) impact interactions and negotiations, and how to establish a dominant frame.

3. **Creating Intrigue:** Klaff suggests making the pitch intriguing by including elements of mystery or challenge, which can capture and hold the audience's attention.

4. **The Prize:** This concept revolves around positioning oneself or one's proposal as a prize to be won by the audience, rather than appearing too eager or needy.

5. **The Hookpoint:** This refers to a crucial part of the pitch where the audience becomes genuinely interested and engaged. Klaff suggests building the pitch up to this point skillfully.

6. **Neuroeconomics:** Klaff integrates principles from neuroeconomics to explain how different parts of the brain (the 'croc brain,' the mid-brain, and the neocortex) respond to pitches. He advises tailoring the pitch to first appeal to the primal 'croc brain' which is responsible for initial filtering of new information.

7. **Status:** Klaff emphasizes the importance of maintaining high status in the eyes of the audience to be persuasive.

8. **Narrative Structure:** The use of stories and narratives to make pitches more engaging and memorable.

9. **Getting a Decision:** Klaff underlines the importance of driving the pitch towards a clear decision, ensuring that it doesn't end with ambiguity or a simple 'we'll think about it'.

Overall, Klaff's approach combines aspects of psychology, sales strategy, and storytelling to create a compelling method for pitching ideas, projects, or products effectively.
