According to the Solar Site Lease Agreement, the responsibility for the removal of the solar panels falls on the lessee. Specifically, within 180 days after the expiration of the lease term or earlier termination of the lease, the lessee is required to decommission and remove the solar facility at their own cost and expense. This includes removing any remaining debris and equipment from the site and the property following the removal. If the lessee fails to commence or continue efforts to remove the solar facility within the specified period, the solar facility is deemed abandoned. In this case, the lessor has the right to either assume title to the solar facility or remove it at the lessee's expense【9†source】.
