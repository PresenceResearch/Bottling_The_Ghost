However, some situations require that a refuse disposal authorization be obtained in advance. Visit the drop-off facilities overview to view an accepted materials list, as well as detailed County disposal regulations.\n\n## Criteria for Authorization Requirement \n\nIf any of the following conditions apply, the County resident must obtain a refuse disposal authorization in advance. If an authorization is not obtained, the resident will be charged a prorated fee of $100 per ton of material. A refuse disposal authorization must be obtained if:\n\n  * A resident wishes to use a vehicle other than a car, van or \"standard\" pick-up (pick-up bed of four by eight feet or less).\n  * A resident wishes to deliver waste which could be construed to be commercial, whether from a business establishment or from \"odd-jobbing\" or \"handyman\" operations.\n  * A resident has a relative or friend who will be hauling the waste on behalf of the resident and at no cost to the resident.\n  * A resident wishes to deliver more than two loads in any size vehicle within a week, or more than six loads in a calendar year.\n  * A resident wishes to deliver an item that is \"Restricted Waste\" (for example, non-metallic boats or campers).\n  * A resident wishes to use a commercially marked vehicle. Please note that a disposal authorization is not automatically needed if a resident uses a pick-up sized or style truck rented from U-Haul or a hardware store (these are the only exceptions); however, other conditions that require a refuse disposal authorization (such as number of loads or type of material) still apply.\n\nA refuse disposal authorization must be requested at least 14 working days before the date you wish to dispose of your material. Have information available about the type of material you'll be bringing, the number of loads you anticipate, and the vehicle you will be delivering it in. For further information, please view our solid waste regulations.\n\n## Request a Refuse Disposal Authorization \n\n  1. Verify That You Meet the Criteria\n\nPrior to applying for a disposal authorization, please verify that:\n\n    * You are the owner of the property where the material is being generated.\n    * The property is your primary residence (rentals are considered commercial).\n    * You are disposing of this material yourself (i.e., not paying someone else to do it for you).\n\n  2. Email the Required Information\n\nIf the above conditions are met, you may email the following information to \u301017\u2020solidwaste@baltimorecountymd.gov\u2020mailto:solidwaste@baltimorecountymd.gov\u3011:\n\n    * Resident\u2019s name \n    * Resident\u2019s address \n    * Resident\u2019s phone numbers \n    * Reason for the disposal authorization request \n    * Type of material being disposed of (building materials, household materials, yard materials)\n    * Description of vehicle being used to transport material, including year, make and model, color, any commercial markings (if applicable) and trailer size (if applicable)\n    * Number of trips requested to dispose of the material (maximum 10 loads permitted; a trailer may count as multiple loads in a single visit)\n    * Name of the driver (if other than the applicant) who will be transporting the material, as well as the driver\u2019s relationship to the applicant \n\nResidents may also call \u301018\u2020410-887-2000\u2020tel:410-887-2000\u3011 with the above information to apply over the phone.\n\n  3. Wait to Hear from Staff After Applying\n\nAfter the Bureau receives the request information, an on-site inspection of the materials may need to be performed by a collection supervisor before authorization is granted or denied.\n\nSubmitting an application does not guarantee that an authorization will be granted. It may take up to 14 business days for an authorization request to be processed.\n\n## Explore Solid Waste Management\n\n  * \u301019\u2020Find Your Collection Schedule\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Collection Set-Out Guide\u3011\n  * \u301021\u2020Items Accepted for Recycling\u3011\n  * \u301022\u2020Bulk Item Collection\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Yard Materials Collection\u3011\n  * \u301024\u2020Drop-Off Centers\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Accepted Materials Directory\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Community Clean-up Program\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Disposal Regulations, Guidelines and Procedures\u3011\n\n## Contact Us\n\n### Bureau of Solid Waste Management\n\n111 West Chesapeake Avenue  \nSuite 211  \nTowson, Maryland 21204 \n\n### Hours:\n\nMonday through Friday   \n7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n### Email:\n\n\u301028\u2020solidwaste@baltimorecountymd.gov\u2020mailto:solidwaste@baltimorecountymd.gov\u3011\n\n### Phone:\n\n\u301018\u2020410-887-2000\u2020tel:410-887-2000\u3011\n\n### BALTCOGO311\n\n\u301029\u2020Report a problem\u3011.\n\n### Bureau Chief:\n\nNicholas Rodricks\n\n## Follow for Updates\n\n### Twitter\n\n\u301030\u2020Follow @BaltCoDPWT\u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n\n### Facebook\n\n\u301031\u2020Follow @BaltCoDPWT\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \n\n[Image 1: Image of the Baltimore County Seal] \n\nBaltimore County Government\n\n\u301032\u2020400 Washington Avenue, Towson Maryland 21204\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\n[Image 2: BaltCoGo 311 Logo]\n\nDownload now on:\n\n  * \u301033\u2020 App Store \u2020itunes.apple.com\u3011\n  * \u301034\u2020 Google Play \u2020play.google.com\u3011\n\n### Find Information\n\n  * \u30101\u2020Find a County Service \u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Phone Numbers \u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020Report a Problem \u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Directions \u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\n### Policies\n\n  * \u301037\u2020User Terms \u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Privacy \u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Reasonable Accommodation \u3011\n\n### Connect With Us\n\n### Translate\n\n  * \u30107\u2020Espa\u00f1ol \u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Fran\u00e7ais \u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \u3011\n  ",

            "In Baltimore County, there are three main waste drop-off centers where residents can take residential trash and recyclables, and they should be accessible for a U-Haul truck:\n\n1. **Eastern Sanitary Landfill Solid Waste Management Facility in White Marsh**\n   - Address: 6259 Days Cove Road, White Marsh, Maryland 21162\n   - Hours: Monday to Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.\n   - Contact: 410-887-2000\n\n2. **Central Acceptance Facility (CAF) in Cockeysville**\n   - Address: 201 West Warren Road, Cockeysville, Maryland 21030\n   - Hours: Monday to Saturday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n   - Contact: 410-887-2000\n\n3. **Western Acceptance Facility (WAF) in Halethorpe**\n   - Address: 3310 Transway Road, Halethorpe, Maryland 21227\n   - Hours: Monday to Saturday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n   - Contact: 410-887-2000\n\nResidents can typically dispose of trash at these facilities without charge, provided they have proof of residence. However, if you're using a vehicle that's larger than a standard pickup truck, like a U-Haul truck, you may need to obtain a refuse disposal authorization in advance. If you don't get this authorization, you might be charged a prorated fee of $100 per ton of material. The authorization is also required if you're delivering waste that could be construed as commercial, or if you're making more than two loads in any size vehicle within a week, or more than six loads in a calendar year.\n\nTo request a refuse disposal authorization, you should contact the Bureau of Solid Waste Management with information about the type of material you're disposing of, the number of loads you anticipate, and the details of the vehicle you'll be using. This can be done via email to solidwaste@baltimorecountymd.gov or by phone at 410-887-2000. The process may take up to 14 business days, so it's advisable to plan ahead.\n\nFor more detailed information and specific directions to these facilities, you can visit the Baltimore County website."
