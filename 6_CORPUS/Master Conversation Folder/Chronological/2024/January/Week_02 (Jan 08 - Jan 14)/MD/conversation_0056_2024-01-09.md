PEPCO's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) requirements for Distributed Energy Resources (DER), as outlined in their stakeholder meeting presentation, include various technical and operational criteria:

1. **Technical Conditions and Criteria Limits**: These criteria are designed to prevent detrimental technical conditions that could impact power quality at the customer level or the reliability of the distribution system. They include managing high- and low-voltage conditions, voltage fluctuations, frequency deviations, harmonic distortions, overcurrent (overload and excessive fault current), impacts on the reliable service life of regulating equipment, reactive power issues (power factor variations), reverse power flow on equipment not designed for it, protection and coordination issues, impacts on the transmission system, and impacts on other customers【10†source】.

2. **Small System Application Review (50kW and Below)**: Systems 10 kW and below have an expedited review process, which is extended to 25 kW systems. For expedited review, the application must meet specific conditions such as not being served by a restricted or network feeder, having an IEEE/UL certified inverter, and the total kW of PV Arrays not exceeding the transformer rating. Applications that do not qualify for expedited review or are between 25kW and 50kW receive a full review by multiple engineering groups【11†source】.

3. **Engineering Screens for Systems Over 250 kW**: These screens require a high-level power flow analysis. The screening criteria include voltage fluctuation not exceeding specific limits, reverse power-generation not exceeding a certain percentage of the daytime minimum load, and ensuring DER does not cause high voltage anywhere on the circuit【12†source】.

4. **Engineering Advanced Study**: Required if the application does not pass the high-level screening process. It includes a time series power flow analysis and uses AMI data to gather customer-specific load data. Types of advanced studies include phase balancing, capacitor controls, lowering load tap changer voltage, and distribution automation operation【13†source】.

5. **Aggregate Limits for Large Generators**: There are specified limits for large (250 kW and over) generators running in parallel with a single existing distribution circuit. These limits vary based on the voltage level of the circuit【14†source】.

6. **Control Scheme for DER Systems Over 50 kW**: Systems over 50 kW must install a monitoring system and inverters that can receive a control signal to maintain the target level of import or export on each phase. The system must provide a web link for utility access, send alerts for defined limit breaches, and have a trip signal for inverters【15†source】.

7. **Criteria for Synchronous Generation**: Synchronous generation must not cause high voltage or adverse impact on automatic line equipment. Criteria include total short circuit current in relation to duty ratings of equipment, the ratio of generation to minimum load in a protected section, and coordination of fuses and reclosers【16†source】.

8. **Energy Storage Evaluation**: The evaluation of energy storage systems follows a similar review/screening/study process as DER generation but with additional considerations depending on whether the energy storage shares an inverter with the generation, has a separate inverter, is used for frequency regulation, or is used only for backup purposes【17†source】. 

These requirements highlight PEPCO's focus on maintaining system reliability and power quality while integrating DERs into the distribution system.
