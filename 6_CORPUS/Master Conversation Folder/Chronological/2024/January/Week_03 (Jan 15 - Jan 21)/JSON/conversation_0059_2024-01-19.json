Acknowledging weakness doesn\u2019t make a leader less effective. Everybody in your organization benefits when you delegate responsibilities that fall outside your core competency.

            "While searching for your quote, I found several insightful quotes about effective leadership, delegation, and the importance of focusing on one's strengths while delegating other tasks. However, I did not find the exact quote you're looking for. Here are a few related quotes that echo the sentiment of maximizing efficiency by focusing on one's strengths and delegating other tasks:\n\n1. Andy Stanley: \"Don\u2019t strive to be a well-rounded leader. Instead, discover your zone and stay there. Then delegate everything else... Thoughtful delegation will allow someone else in your organization to shine\"\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n   \n2. Timothy Ferriss: \"Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined\"\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. Richard Branson: \"From a young age, I learned to focus on the things I was good at and delegate to others what I was not good at. That\u2019s how Virgin is run\"\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. Frederick W. Smith: \"A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can\"\u30106\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. Peter Drucker: \"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things\"\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThese quotes emphasize the importance of recognizing one's unique skills and delegating other tasks to ensure organizational efficiency and effectiveness. The concept you are referring to is often associated with the economic principle of \"comparative advantage,\" where individuals and entities are encouraged to engage in tasks where they have the most skill or least opportunity cost, and delegate or trade for others."

                "text": "\n> \u201cHere\u2019s what I know: Time must be explicitly managed, like money. You can always change your plan, but only if you have one. Ask yourself: Are you spending your time on the right things? Develop a good filing system. Rethink the telephone. Delegate. Take a time out. Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.\u201d \n> \n> Randy Pausch, \u301012\u2020The Last Lecture\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n\n### 2. Andy Stanley \n\n> Don\u2019t strive to be a well-rounded leader. Instead, discover your zone and stay there. Then delegate everything else. Admitting a weakness is a sign of strength. Acknowledging weakness doesn\u2019t make a leader less effective. Everybody in your organization benefits when you delegate responsibilities that fall outside your core competency. Thoughtful delegation will allow someone else in your organization to shine. Your weakness is someone\u2019s opportunity. Leadership is not always about getting things done \u201cright.\u201d Leadership is about getting things done through other people.\n> \n> Andy Stanle y\n\n### 3. Tim Ferriss\n\n> Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else\u2019s time instead of your own, which now wastes your hard-earned cash. How\u2019s that for incentive to be effective and efficient?\n> \n> T imothy Ferriss, \u301013\u2020The 4-Hour Workweek\u2020www.goodreads.com\u3011\n\n### 4. Douglas McGregor\n\n> Delegation means that he will concern himself with the results of their activities and not with the details of their day-to-day performance. This requires a degree of confidence in them which enables him to accept certain risks. Unless he takes these risks there will be no delegation.\n> \n> Douglas McGregor\n\n### 5. James D. Mooney \n\n> Failure to delegate causes managers to be crushed and fail under the weight of accumulated duties that they do not know and have not learned to delegate.\n> \n> James D. Mooney \n\n### 6. Richard Branson \n\n> From a young age, I learned to focus on the things I was good at and delegate to others what I was not good at. That\u2019s how Virgin is run. Fantastic people throughout the Virgin Group run our businesses, allowing me to think creatively and strategically.\n> \n> Richard Branson\n\n### 7. Oprah Winfrey\n\n> Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher.\n> \n> Oprah Winfrey\n\n### 8. James Altucher\n\n> I find that many entrepreneurs are trying to do everything when it would be cheaper and more time-efficient to delegate, even if there are monetary costs associated with that.\n> \n> James Altucher\n\n### 9. Jessica Jackley \n\n> As all entrepreneurs know, you live and die by your ability to prioritize. You must focus on the most important, mission-critical tasks each day and night, and then share, delegate, delay or skip the rest.\n> \n> Jessica Jackley\n\n### 10. Anthea Turner\n\n> The first rule of management is delegation. Don\u2019t try and do everything yourself because you can\u2019t.\n> \n> Anthea Turner\n\n## How Do You Know When To Delegate?\n\nTry to delegate the non-technical and non-specialized things that take the most time and mental effort. For example, email management, scheduling, expense reporting, travel booking, todo list and task management, and employee onboarding are all non-technical tasks that take a lot of time. These are \u301014\u2020common things people delegate\u3011. However, your specific list is going to depend on your unique situation.\n\n### Delegate Responsibility, Responsibly\n\n\u301015\u2020What you can delegate\u3011 is dependent on the skill-level of the assistant you\u2019ve hired. Some assistants are great problem solvers and have the organizational skills needed to manage entire teams in pursuit of your strategic goals. Others require lots of hand-holding and micromanagement, and even step-by-step instructions. This is why it\u2019s important for you to get clear on what your needs are, so you can choose what level of assistant you need.\n\n## How To Create A Delegation Task List\n\n### 1. Perform a calendar audit.\n\nGo to your \u301016\u2020weekly calendar\u3011 and write out all the different things you do in a given work week. Next to each item write out how long each task takes.\n\n### 2. Cross out the things that only you can do.\n\nGo through your list, item by item, and ask yourself whether you\u2019re the only person who can do the task. If the task is particularly technical or requires knowledge that only you have, cross it out.\n\n### 3. Delegate the most time consuming tasks that someone else can do.\n\nAfter you\u2019re left with a list of tasks that someone else can do, order them according to how much time they require and delegate the most time-consuming ones first. Frame success in clear terms, and spell out any tricky parts of the task, what to do if they run into problem areas, and your ultimate objectives.\n\n## How Do Executive Assistants Add Value?\n\nExecutive Assistants add value by freeing up time for the team and business people they support. From managing email to scheduling meetings, the right assistant with eliminate distractions and let you focus on your business (or your personal life). The \u301017\u2020best executive assistants\u3011 can automate many common tasks, as well, which can open up many new possibilities. \n\nOne of the main reasons entrepreneurs make the mistake of hesitating to hire an assistant is because they\u2019re afraid of the costs. But delegating time consuming and mentally draining tasks to an assistant is often the difference between startup success and failure. \n\nWe only have so much time and mental energy each day. The question is not \u201chow expensive is an executive assistant?\u201d, but \u201chow expensive is it for me to not have an executive assistant?\u201d.\n\n## How Do You Find Good Executive Assistants?\n\nGreat assistants are detail oriented, reliable, clear communicators, and great at problem solving. \u301018\u2020Finding assistants\u3011 who are all these things is hard. You can post jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards in search of someone who fits this description. Or you can look on a site like Upwork or Fiverr. But the most reliable way to find a great assistant is by using an executive assistant service like Persona.\n\n## What Kinds Of Tasks Can An Executive Assistant Automate?\n\nThe tasks that assistants can automate are as varied as the industries they operate in.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of what\u2019s possible:\n\n  * Email management\n  * Calendar management\n  * Scheduling\n  * Appointment setting\n  * Expense reporting\n  * Expense tracking\n  * Bookkeeping\n  * Project management\n  * Social media management\n  * Social media content creation\n  * File management and organization\n  * Online purchases\n  * Travel planning\n  * Shopify, Amazon, and e-commerce\n  * Booking flights and hotels\n  * Market research and analysis\n  * Lead generation\n  * Cold outreach\n  * Email list management\n  * Posting ads on Facebook\n  * Posting ads on Google\n  * Posting ads on TikTok\n  * Posting ads on YouTube\n  * Note taking\n  * Meeting minutes\n  * Event planning\n  * Transcription\n  * Content writing\n  * Report writing\n  * Workflow management\n  * Data entry\n  * Data management\n\nThe list goes on and on. \n\n## Does Every CEO Need An Executive Assistant?\n\nYes. Every \u301019\u2020CEO\u3011 that values their time and the success of their organization need to hire an executive assistant. Hiring a competent assistant is key to focusing on your strengths and working on the most important, strategic projects for your business.\n\n### Great Business Leaders Master The Art Of Delegation\n\nThe right executive assistant will help you figure out what to delegate, and what you should do yourself. The goal of every executive assistant is helping their executive focus on the most important, mission-critical tasks each day.\n\nOne of the main reasons people fail at delegation is because they don\u2019t hire someone qualified to delegate to. You can\u2019t just hire any virtual assistant or personal assistant. You need someone who\u2019s smart, detail oriented, professional, responsible, reliable, and a great communicator.\n\nSuccessful companies and managers get buried in new tasks and to-dos faster than they can do them. Delegation is a necessary skill. If you don\u2019t delegate, you won\u2019t have enough time to focus on what matters and build a great product, company, or startup. Hiring an assistant can be the difference between \u301020\u2020startup success\u3011 and failure.\n\n### Delegation Is The First Rule Of Management For A Reason\n\nRichard Branson discovered what a powerful thing delegation was at an early age. And he credits his success in business to understanding that great \u301021\u2020leaders delegate accordingly\u3011 so they can focus on the key skills that drive business growth.\n\nWhen done correctly, delegation can be a powerful tool for leaders. It allows them to focus on the crucial tasks and projects that only they can do, and it empowers other team members to grow and take on more responsibility. Delegation is the simple act of giving someone else responsibility over a task, so you can free up your time to work on something else.\n\nDelegation doesn\u2019t mean abdicating responsibility and assigning all your work to others. The key to successful delegation is to pick the right tasks, assign them to the right people, and to give them the appropriate level of responsibility.\n\n### Delegating to an executive assistant can be the difference between a good entrepreneur and a great one.\n\nEvery great leader knows that they can\u2019t do everything themselves, and delegation is one of a few small things that separates a great business leader from a bad one.

Ask yourself: Are you spending your time on the right things? Develop a good filing system. Rethink the telephone. Delegate. Take a time out. Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.\u201d \n> \n> Randy Pausch, \u301012\u2020The Last Lecture\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011\n\n### 2. Andy Stanley \n\n> Don\u2019t strive to be a well-rounded leader. Instead, discover your zone and stay there. Then delegate everything else. Admitting a weakness is a sign of strength. Acknowledging weakness doesn\u2019t make a leader less effective. Everybody in your organization benefits when you delegate responsibilities that fall outside your core competency. Thoughtful delegation will allow someone else in your organization to shine. Your weakness is someone\u2019s opportunity. Leadership is not always about getting things done \u201cright.\u201d Leadership is about getting things done through other people.\n> \n> Andy Stanle y\n\n### 3.

Douglas McGregor\n\n> Delegation means that he will concern himself with the results of their activities and not with the details of their day-to-day performance. This requires a degree of confidence in them which enables him to accept certain risks. Unless he takes these risks there will be no delegation.\n> \n> Douglas McGregor\n\n### 5. James D. Mooney \n\n> Failure to delegate causes managers to be crushed and fail under the weight of accumulated duties that they do not know and have not learned to delegate.\n> \n> James D. Mooney \n\n### 6. Richard Branson \n\n> From a young age, I learned to focus on the things I was good at and delegate to others what I was not good at. That\u2019s how Virgin is run. Fantastic people throughout the Virgin Group run our businesses, allowing me to think creatively and strategically.\n> \n> Richard Branson\n\n### 7.

Anthea Turner\n\n> The first rule of management is delegation. Don\u2019t try and do everything yourself because you can\u2019t.\n> \n> Anthea Turner\n\n## How Do You Know When To Delegate?\n\nTry to delegate the non-technical and non-specialized things that take the most time and mental effort. For example, email management, scheduling, expense reporting, travel booking, todo list and task management, and employee onboarding are all non-technical tasks that take a lot of time. These are \u301014\u2020common things people delegate\u3011. However, your specific list is going to depend on your unique situation.\n\n### Delegate Responsibility, Responsibly\n\n\u301015\u2020What you can delegate\u3011 is dependent on the skill-level of the assistant you\u2019ve hired. Some assistants are great problem solvers and have the organizational skills needed to manage entire teams in pursuit of your strategic goals. Others require lots of hand-holding and micromanagement, and even step-by-step instructions. This is why it\u2019s important for you to get clear on what your needs are, so you can choose what level of assistant you need.\n\n## How To Create A Delegation Task List\n\n### 1. Perform a calendar audit.\n\nGo to your \u301016\u2020weekly calendar\u3011 and write out all the different things you do in a given work week. Next to each item write out how long each task takes.\n\n### 2. Cross out the things that only you can do.\n\nGo through your list, item by item, and ask yourself whether you\u2019re the only person who can do the task. If the task is particularly technical or requires knowledge that only you have, cross it out.\n\n### 3. Delegate the most time consuming tasks that someone else can do.\n\nAfter you\u2019re left with a list of tasks that someone else can do, order them according to how much time they require and delegate the most time-consuming ones first. Frame success in clear terms, and spell out any tricky parts of the task, what to do if they run into problem areas, and your ultimate objectives.\n\n## How Do Executive Assistants Add Value?\n\nExecutive Assistants add value by freeing up time for the team and business people they support. From managing email to scheduling meetings, the right assistant with eliminate distractions and let you focus on your business (or your personal life). The \u301017\u2020best executive assistants\u3011 can automate many common tasks, as well, which can open up many new possibilities. \n\nOne of the main reasons entrepreneurs make the mistake of hesitating to hire an assistant is because they\u2019re afraid of the costs. But delegating time consuming and mentally draining tasks to an assistant is often the difference between startup success and failure. \n\nWe only have so much time and mental energy each day.

Stephen Covey\n\n> Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; \u301084\u2020leadership\u3011 determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.\n\n### 2. Paul Hawken\n\n> Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them.\n\n### 3. Peter Drucker\n\n> A manager sets objectives, organizes, motivates, and communicates, sets yardsticks, and measures develops people.\n\n### 4. Liz Brenner\n\n> Great managers fight for their people.\n\n### 5. Jack Welch\n\n> One of the jobs of a manager is to instill confidence, pump confidence into your people. And when you've got somebody who's raring to go, and you can smell it and feel it, give 'em that shot.\n\n### 6. Brian Tracy\n\n> Achieving the highest possible return on human capital must be every manager's goal.\n\n### 7. Steve Jobs\n\n> Management is about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things they never thought they could.\n\n### 8. Lee Iacocca\n\n> If I had to sum up in a word what makes a good manager, I'd say decisiveness. You can use the fanciest computers to gather the numbers, but in the end you have to set a timetable and act.\n\n### 9. Frederick W. Smith\n\n> A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can.\n\n### 10. Earl Weaver\n\n> A manager's job is simple. For one hundred sixty-two games, you try not to screw up all that smart stuff your organization did last December.\n\n### 11.

Patton\n\n> Don't tell people how to do things; tell them what to do and let them surprise you.\n\n### 15. Robert Townsend\n\n> One of the most important tasks of a manager is to eliminate his people\u2019s excuse for failure.\n\n### 16. James Cook\n\n> To be a good manager of people requires both fairness and bluntness.\n\n### 17. Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\n\n> If you want to build a ship, don\u2019t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\n\n### 18. Nelson Mandela\n\n> It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.\n\n### 19. Marissa Mayer\n\n> Find the smartest people you can and surround yourself with them.\n\n### 20. Helen McCabe\n\n> One bad day from one member of my staff doesn\u2019t mean they are not really good at their jobs the rest of the time. I play a long game in terms of management.\n\n### 21. Casey Stengel\n\n> The key to being a good manager is keeping the people who hate me away from those who are still undecided.\n\n### 22.

Jim Rohn\n\n> The challenge of leadership is to be strong, but not rude; be kind, but not weak; be bold, but not bully; be thoughtful, but not lazy; be humble, but not timid; be proud, but not arrogant; have humor but without folly.\n\n### 26. Ben Horowitz\n\n> If I have one skill as a manager, I can make things extremely clear.\n\n### 27. Denis Waitley\n\n> Don't be a time manager, be a priority manager. Cut your major goals into bite-sized pieces. Each small priority or requirement on the way to ultimate goal becomes a mini goal in itself.\n\n### 28. Mike Huckabee\n\n> A leader is the one who can outline the broad vision and the direction and say, here's where we are going to go, here's why we need to go there, and here's how we are going to get there. A manager is the one who actually gets up under the hood and tunes the carburetor.\n\n### 29. Bob Nelson\n\n> An employee's motivation is a direct result of the sum of interactions with his or her manager.\n\n### 30. Mark Hughes\n\n> Sometimes the manager actually is the glue that holds everything together, and when you take that manager out, sometimes that's when things start to go really wrong.\n\n### 31. Edin Dz\n\n> I think, for every player, it is important he knows the manager believes in him, and it is important he has the confidence of the manager. That helps you to find the best form.\n\n### 32. Charles Murray\n\n> You can learn a lot about good management by working under someone who is a bad manager.\n\n### 33.

Don't accept [any engagements] if you can't justify them as benefiting your users or your company.\" \u2014 Mark Pincus, co-founder and CEO of Zynga\n\n\u201cIf you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you\u2019ll never get it done.\u201d\u2014 Bruce Lee, iconic martial artist and actor\n\n\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin, inventor, diplomat and a Founding Father of the United States\n\n\u201cI think the hardest part of aging really is recognizing the time that you wasted and the things that you worried about that really didn\u2019t matter\u2026. That\u2019s really the only regret that I have.\u201d \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, talk show host, entrepreneur and wealthiest woman of African descent in the world\n\n\u201cThe essence of self-discipline is to do the important thing rather than the urgent thing.\u201d \u2013 Barry Werner, sportscaster\n\n\"It's very easy to get distracted by your inbox or phone.

I just dig in and get it done.\" \u2014 Koel Thomae, co-founder of Noosa Yoghurt\n\n\u201cTime = life; therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life.\u201d \u2014 Alan Lakein, author of How to Get Control of Your Time\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?\u201d \u2014 Henry David Thoreau, American essayist, poet and philosopher\n\nAs these quotes demonstrate, not all successful people speak or think the same way about time. Some believe in making rigid plans. Others believe in thinking ahead but not necessarily committing to a certain action. Some believe that devoting time to daydreaming, resting or sleeping are key to their success. \n\nBut what all of these people clearly understand is that, no matter how you choose to use your time, you cannot afford to be careless about it. Time, \u301018\u2020like money\u3011, can be spent in very different ways, but it needs to be used thoughtfully.\n\nNeed even more inspiration?
