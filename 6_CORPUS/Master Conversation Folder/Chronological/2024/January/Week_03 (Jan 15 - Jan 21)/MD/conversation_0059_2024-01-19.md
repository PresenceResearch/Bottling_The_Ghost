While searching for your quote, I found several insightful quotes about effective leadership, delegation, and the importance of focusing on one's strengths while delegating other tasks. However, I did not find the exact quote you're looking for. Here are a few related quotes that echo the sentiment of maximizing efficiency by focusing on one's strengths and delegating other tasks:

1. Andy Stanley: "Don’t strive to be a well-rounded leader. Instead, discover your zone and stay there. Then delegate everything else... Thoughtful delegation will allow someone else in your organization to shine"【5†source】.
   
2. Timothy Ferriss: "Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined"【5†source】.

3. Richard Branson: "From a young age, I learned to focus on the things I was good at and delegate to others what I was not good at. That’s how Virgin is run"【5†source】.

4. Frederick W. Smith: "A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can"【6†source】.

5. Peter Drucker: "Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things"【7†source】.

These quotes emphasize the importance of recognizing one's unique skills and delegating other tasks to ensure organizational efficiency and effectiveness. The concept you are referring to is often associated with the economic principle of "comparative advantage," where individuals and entities are encouraged to engage in tasks where they have the most skill or least opportunity cost, and delegate or trade for others.
