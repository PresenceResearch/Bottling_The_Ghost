            "The label in the image reads: \n\n**John Weitz**\n**Tailored in U.S.A. for**\n**The Coach House Pittsburgh**\n\n**John Weitz**: John Weitz was a renowned fashion designer, author, and historian. He was known for his men's sportswear and his influence on American fashion during the mid-20th century. Weitz's designs were characterized by their blend of traditional tailoring with modern, casual styles, making them popular among American men in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n**Tailored in U.S.A.**: This indicates that the garment was made in the United States, which was a mark of quality and craftsmanship during the time it was produced. In the mid-20th century, American-made clothing was often seen as superior in terms of materials and construction.\n\n**The Coach House Pittsburgh**: The Coach House was a prominent high-end men's clothing store located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was known for offering quality, tailored clothing from prestigious designers. Stores like The Coach House played a significant role in bringing designer fashion to local markets, making high-end fashion more accessible to the American public.\n\nThe combination of John Weitz's design with The Coach House's reputation for quality suggests that this garment was a premium item, likely marketed towards affluent customers seeking stylish yet well-made clothing. This label represents a period when American fashion was gaining prominence and quality craftsmanship was highly valued."

          "text": "\n### Writer[\u301090\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nFrom 1970 to the 1990s, Weitz wrote both fiction and historical non-fiction, much centered on Nazi-era Germany. He also wrote frequent magazine articles on a variety of subjects, including his hobby as a race car driver.[23] Weitz raced at \u301091\u2020Sebring International Raceway\u3011 from 1955 to 1957,[12] as well as the Bahamas Grand Prix Circuit.[6]\n\nWhile spending time on Long Island, Weitz was encouraged by the writer \u301092\u2020John Steinbeck\u3011 to write. His early novels were bestsellers.[24] While his early novels were semi-autobiographical, including focuses on style, the fashion business, and his experiences in Germany, his latter non-fiction books were serious biographies of \u301093\u2020Joachim von Ribbentrop\u3011,[25] Foreign Minister of \u301094\u2020Third Reich\u3011, and \u301095\u2020Hjalmar Schacht\u3011,[26] President of the \u301096\u2020Reichsbank\u3011 and Minister of Economics.[24]\n\n## Personal life[\u301097\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nWeitz was married three times. His first marriage, from 1944 to 1953, was to Sally Blauner Gould.[27] He had married Blauner when he was 20 years old. Blauner was from \u301098\u2020Philadelphia\u3011, \u301099\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011, and her family owned the Blauner's department store chain.[18] He had a daughter and son with Gould, Karen Weitz Curtis and Robert Weitz. In 1964, Weitz separated from his second wife, Eve Orton, who was a fashion editor.[28]\n\nIn 1964, Weitz met actress \u301051\u2020Susan Kohner\u3011 in \u3010100\u2020Palm Beach\u3011, \u3010101\u2020Florida\u3011. Kohner's father was a well known talent agent named \u301055\u2020Paul Kohner\u3011; her mother was actress \u301054\u2020Lupita Tovar\u3011.[7] Weitz married Kohner in 1964.[29] They had two sons, directors \u301052\u2020Paul Weitz\u3011 and \u301053\u2020Chris Weitz\u3011.[3]\n\nIn addition to his race car driving hobby, Weitz enjoyed boating, and was a member of yacht clubs in Palm Beach, East Hampton, Sag Harbor, as well as part of the US Naval Academy Sailing Squadron.[21]\n\n## Awards[\u3010102\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * 1959: \u3010103\u2020Sports Illustrated\u3011 award[30]\n  * 1960: NBC \u3010104\u2020Today Show\u3011 award\n  * 1964-1967: \u3010105\u2020Caswell-Massey Awards\u3011[19]\n  * 1966: \u3010106\u2020Harper's Bazaar\u3011 Medallion\n  * 1967: Moscow Diploma\n  * 1974: \u3010107\u2020Coty American Fashion Critics' Award\u3011\n  * 1975: Brilliant Pen Award (MFI)\n  * 1981: Cartier Award for Design Excellence\n  * 1986: Cutty Sark Menswear Award\n  * 1986: Mayor's Liberty Award\n  * 1988: \u3010108\u2020Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\u3011\n  * 1990: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n  * 1990: Dallas Menswear Mart award\n  * 1990: Fashion Institute of Technology President's award\n  * 1992: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n\n## Works and publications[\u3010110\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * Weitz, John.

                "text": "\n### Writer[\u301090\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nFrom 1970 to the 1990s, Weitz wrote both fiction and historical non-fiction, much centered on Nazi-era Germany. He also wrote frequent magazine articles on a variety of subjects, including his hobby as a race car driver.[23] Weitz raced at \u301091\u2020Sebring International Raceway\u3011 from 1955 to 1957,[12] as well as the Bahamas Grand Prix Circuit.[6]\n\nWhile spending time on Long Island, Weitz was encouraged by the writer \u301092\u2020John Steinbeck\u3011 to write. His early novels were bestsellers.[24] While his early novels were semi-autobiographical, including focuses on style, the fashion business, and his experiences in Germany, his latter non-fiction books were serious biographies of \u301093\u2020Joachim von Ribbentrop\u3011,[25] Foreign Minister of \u301094\u2020Third Reich\u3011, and \u301095\u2020Hjalmar Schacht\u3011,[26] President of the \u301096\u2020Reichsbank\u3011 and Minister of Economics.[24]\n\n## Personal life[\u301097\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nWeitz was married three times. His first marriage, from 1944 to 1953, was to Sally Blauner Gould.[27] He had married Blauner when he was 20 years old. Blauner was from \u301098\u2020Philadelphia\u3011, \u301099\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011, and her family owned the Blauner's department store chain.[18] He had a daughter and son with Gould, Karen Weitz Curtis and Robert Weitz. In 1964, Weitz separated from his second wife, Eve Orton, who was a fashion editor.[28]\n\nIn 1964, Weitz met actress \u301051\u2020Susan Kohner\u3011 in \u3010100\u2020Palm Beach\u3011, \u3010101\u2020Florida\u3011. Kohner's father was a well known talent agent named \u301055\u2020Paul Kohner\u3011; her mother was actress \u301054\u2020Lupita Tovar\u3011.[7] Weitz married Kohner in 1964.[29] They had two sons, directors \u301052\u2020Paul Weitz\u3011 and \u301053\u2020Chris Weitz\u3011.[3]\n\nIn addition to his race car driving hobby, Weitz enjoyed boating, and was a member of yacht clubs in Palm Beach, East Hampton, Sag Harbor, as well as part of the US Naval Academy Sailing Squadron.[21]\n\n## Awards[\u3010102\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * 1959: \u3010103\u2020Sports Illustrated\u3011 award[30]\n  * 1960: NBC \u3010104\u2020Today Show\u3011 award\n  * 1964-1967: \u3010105\u2020Caswell-Massey Awards\u3011[19]\n  * 1966: \u3010106\u2020Harper's Bazaar\u3011 Medallion\n  * 1967: Moscow Diploma\n  * 1974: \u3010107\u2020Coty American Fashion Critics' Award\u3011\n  * 1975: Brilliant Pen Award (MFI)\n  * 1981: Cartier Award for Design Excellence\n  * 1986: Cutty Sark Menswear Award\n  * 1986: Mayor's Liberty Award\n  * 1988: \u3010108\u2020Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\u3011\n  * 1990: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n  * 1990: Dallas Menswear Mart award\n  * 1990: Fashion Institute of Technology President's award\n  * 1992: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n\n## Works and publications[\u3010110\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * Weitz, John.

The last thing I want is to be controlled by fashion.\" No one would say\u2014and certainly no one would dare say in his presence\u2014that Weitz is controlled by fashion. Rather he has treated fashion as a chosen field, one among many. He abandoned the competitive field of womenswear for a mannerly, self-invented calling in menswear. Even there, he stayed slightly aloof, choosing to be the debonair gentleman rather than fashion victim/victimizer. He has two rare personalities\u2014a late New York intellectual and a natural aristocrat who has seen aristocracies disintegrate, but who persists in imagining new ones.\n\nSince the 1940s, Weitz has spoken a gentlemanly common sense about fashion for men and women. First encouraged by Dorothy Shaver of Lord & Taylor in the 1940s to pursue women's sportswear with his demanding sense of a contemporary postwar lifestyle, Weitz carried his marrow of American practicality within the genteel spirit of his own European and English cultivation. As much a man of letters and ideas as of fashion, once an adventurer who drove race cars and was solicited to portray James Bond, Weitz is a consummate gentleman in the sometimes less than genteel world of fashion.\n\nWhile his great achievements in apparel in the 1950s were of women's sportswear, he became one of the first men's fashion designers in the early 1960s, shifting his emphasis to this field for its capability to fulfill his interest in classic looks, utmost practicality, and no-nonsense durability. Until \u301025\u2020Giorgio Armani\u3011 and \u301026\u2020Ralph Lauren\u3011 in the late 1970s and 1980s, no designer was as faithful as Weitz to menswear. In personal style as well as his design, Weitz exemplified the refined but unpretentious good taste that comes of humane attention to what is important in life, with clothing following as a consequence of those values. Even in the extreme years of menswear in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Weitz's vision was always tempered.\n\nIf Weitz was first a visionary of the disciplines of sportswear for women in America, he transferred his allegiance to menswear in the early 1960s when a number of designers were testing the waters of menswear, among them Geoffrey Beene and \u301027\u2020Bill Blass\u3011 in America, Hardy Amies in \u301028\u2020England\u3011, and \u301029\u2020Pierre Cardin\u3011 in \u301030\u2020France\u3011. Weitz alone gave his primary attention to menswear, a field where his own principal ideas had first come from observing the Duke of Windsor. Long before absorbing and ultimately creating the ethos of sportswear, Weitz had been an assistant to Molyneux in London. There, he was a part of fashion that was fastidious, client-driven, and rich in protocol and money.\n\nWhen asked in Interview (March 1983) if he considered himself a couturier, Weitz replied, \"Good God, no. I'm a modern-day creature that emerged from an old couture assistant into a sort of inventive concept, which I don't mind at all.\" His acumen for business and licensing has enabled Weitz to build an empire in menswear with a minimum of participation from the designer. His own engaging and cosmopolitan charm establishes only the guidelines for product development. In many ways, Weitz was the first to be such a designer\u2014god-like then thereafter far removed from the world of his own creation. Weitz makes a point, however, of wearing his own clothes; this is a matter of honor for a man of Boy Scoutish, even knightly, integrity.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century Weitz still offered a graceful conceptual model of a fashion designer, though he had significantly segued into other professions as well. As an author of several books, both novels and historical biographies, the designer had been spending more time writing than sketching\n\n\"Dress is a form of tribalism,\" Weitz commented to Forbes (5 May 1997), \"People wear what their tribe wears\u2014executives, blue-collar workers, undertakers, accountants. They want to feel tribally appropriate. Distinguishing yourself within your tribe is a matter of style, not fashion.\"\n\n\"\u2026I never planned on being a great couturier,\" says Weitz, who switched to menswear in 1964. \"To me fashion is not an art but a craft\u2026.\" told People (Oct 26, 1992) While Weitz himself is a longtime member of internationally best-dressed Hall of Fame, his long wool coats still sell as do his tailored men's shirts, socks, and a host of other accessories.\n\n\u2014Richard Martin\n\nContemporary Fashion\n\n\u00d7\n\nCite this article    \nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\n  * MLA\n  * Chicago\n  * APA\n\n\"\u301031\u2020Weitz, John .\u3011\" Contemporary Fashion. .

The last thing I want is to be controlled by fashion.\" No one would say\u2014and certainly no one would dare say in his presence\u2014that Weitz is controlled by fashion. Rather he has treated fashion as a chosen field, one among many. He abandoned the competitive field of womenswear for a mannerly, self-invented calling in menswear. Even there, he stayed slightly aloof, choosing to be the debonair gentleman rather than fashion victim/victimizer. He has two rare personalities\u2014a late New York intellectual and a natural aristocrat who has seen aristocracies disintegrate, but who persists in imagining new ones.\n\nSince the 1940s, Weitz has spoken a gentlemanly common sense about fashion for men and women. First encouraged by Dorothy Shaver of Lord & Taylor in the 1940s to pursue women's sportswear with his demanding sense of a contemporary postwar lifestyle, Weitz carried his marrow of American practicality within the genteel spirit of his own European and English cultivation. As much a man of letters and ideas as of fashion, once an adventurer who drove race cars and was solicited to portray James Bond, Weitz is a consummate gentleman in the sometimes less than genteel world of fashion.\n\nWhile his great achievements in apparel in the 1950s were of women's sportswear, he became one of the first men's fashion designers in the early 1960s, shifting his emphasis to this field for its capability to fulfill his interest in classic looks, utmost practicality, and no-nonsense durability. Until \u301025\u2020Giorgio Armani\u3011 and \u301026\u2020Ralph Lauren\u3011 in the late 1970s and 1980s, no designer was as faithful as Weitz to menswear. In personal style as well as his design, Weitz exemplified the refined but unpretentious good taste that comes of humane attention to what is important in life, with clothing following as a consequence of those values. Even in the extreme years of menswear in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Weitz's vision was always tempered.\n\nIf Weitz was first a visionary of the disciplines of sportswear for women in America, he transferred his allegiance to menswear in the early 1960s when a number of designers were testing the waters of menswear, among them Geoffrey Beene and \u301027\u2020Bill Blass\u3011 in America, Hardy Amies in \u301028\u2020England\u3011, and \u301029\u2020Pierre Cardin\u3011 in \u301030\u2020France\u3011. Weitz alone gave his primary attention to menswear, a field where his own principal ideas had first come from observing the Duke of Windsor. Long before absorbing and ultimately creating the ethos of sportswear, Weitz had been an assistant to Molyneux in London. There, he was a part of fashion that was fastidious, client-driven, and rich in protocol and money.\n\nWhen asked in Interview (March 1983) if he considered himself a couturier, Weitz replied, \"Good God, no. I'm a modern-day creature that emerged from an old couture assistant into a sort of inventive concept, which I don't mind at all.\" His acumen for business and licensing has enabled Weitz to build an empire in menswear with a minimum of participation from the designer. His own engaging and cosmopolitan charm establishes only the guidelines for product development. In many ways, Weitz was the first to be such a designer\u2014god-like then thereafter far removed from the world of his own creation. Weitz makes a point, however, of wearing his own clothes; this is a matter of honor for a man of Boy Scoutish, even knightly, integrity.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century Weitz still offered a graceful conceptual model of a fashion designer, though he had significantly segued into other professions as well. As an author of several books, both novels and historical biographies, the designer had been spending more time writing than sketching\n\n\"Dress is a form of tribalism,\" Weitz commented to Forbes (5 May 1997), \"People wear what their tribe wears\u2014executives, blue-collar workers, undertakers, accountants. They want to feel tribally appropriate. Distinguishing yourself within your tribe is a matter of style, not fashion.\"\n\n\"\u2026I never planned on being a great couturier,\" says Weitz, who switched to menswear in 1964. \"To me fashion is not an art but a craft\u2026.\" told People (Oct 26, 1992) While Weitz himself is a longtime member of internationally best-dressed Hall of Fame, his long wool coats still sell as do his tailored men's shirts, socks, and a host of other accessories.\n\n\u2014Richard Martin\n\nContemporary Fashion\n\n\u00d7\n\nCite this article    \nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\n  * MLA\n  * Chicago\n  * APA\n\n\"\u301031\u2020Weitz, John .\u3011\" Contemporary Fashion. .

            "The coat with the label \"John Weitz Tailored in U.S.A. for The Coach House Pittsburgh\" was likely produced during the peak years of John Weitz's influence in the menswear industry, which spanned from the 1960s to the 1980s. John Weitz transitioned from women's sportswear to men's fashion in the early 1960s, and his designs became a staple of stylish yet practical menswear during that time\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe Coach House in Pittsburgh was known for offering high-quality tailored clothing, and garments tailored for such specialty stores often reflect the fashion trends and quality standards of the era they were produced in. Given the prominence of John Weitz and the association with The Coach House, it is reasonable to place this coat's manufacture in the 1970s or 1980s, aligning with Weitz's most active and influential period in menswear design."

                "text": "\n### Writer[\u301090\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nFrom 1970 to the 1990s, Weitz wrote both fiction and historical non-fiction, much centered on Nazi-era Germany. He also wrote frequent magazine articles on a variety of subjects, including his hobby as a race car driver.[23] Weitz raced at \u301091\u2020Sebring International Raceway\u3011 from 1955 to 1957,[12] as well as the Bahamas Grand Prix Circuit.[6]\n\nWhile spending time on Long Island, Weitz was encouraged by the writer \u301092\u2020John Steinbeck\u3011 to write. His early novels were bestsellers.[24] While his early novels were semi-autobiographical, including focuses on style, the fashion business, and his experiences in Germany, his latter non-fiction books were serious biographies of \u301093\u2020Joachim von Ribbentrop\u3011,[25] Foreign Minister of \u301094\u2020Third Reich\u3011, and \u301095\u2020Hjalmar Schacht\u3011,[26] President of the \u301096\u2020Reichsbank\u3011 and Minister of Economics.[24]\n\n## Personal life[\u301097\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nWeitz was married three times. His first marriage, from 1944 to 1953, was to Sally Blauner Gould.[27] He had married Blauner when he was 20 years old. Blauner was from \u301098\u2020Philadelphia\u3011, \u301099\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011, and her family owned the Blauner's department store chain.[18] He had a daughter and son with Gould, Karen Weitz Curtis and Robert Weitz. In 1964, Weitz separated from his second wife, Eve Orton, who was a fashion editor.[28]\n\nIn 1964, Weitz met actress \u301051\u2020Susan Kohner\u3011 in \u3010100\u2020Palm Beach\u3011, \u3010101\u2020Florida\u3011. Kohner's father was a well known talent agent named \u301055\u2020Paul Kohner\u3011; her mother was actress \u301054\u2020Lupita Tovar\u3011.[7] Weitz married Kohner in 1964.[29] They had two sons, directors \u301052\u2020Paul Weitz\u3011 and \u301053\u2020Chris Weitz\u3011.[3]\n\nIn addition to his race car driving hobby, Weitz enjoyed boating, and was a member of yacht clubs in Palm Beach, East Hampton, Sag Harbor, as well as part of the US Naval Academy Sailing Squadron.[21]\n\n## Awards[\u3010102\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * 1959: \u3010103\u2020Sports Illustrated\u3011 award[30]\n  * 1960: NBC \u3010104\u2020Today Show\u3011 award\n  * 1964-1967: \u3010105\u2020Caswell-Massey Awards\u3011[19]\n  * 1966: \u3010106\u2020Harper's Bazaar\u3011 Medallion\n  * 1967: Moscow Diploma\n  * 1974: \u3010107\u2020Coty American Fashion Critics' Award\u3011\n  * 1975: Brilliant Pen Award (MFI)\n  * 1981: Cartier Award for Design Excellence\n  * 1986: Cutty Sark Menswear Award\n  * 1986: Mayor's Liberty Award\n  * 1988: \u3010108\u2020Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\u3011\n  * 1990: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n  * 1990: Dallas Menswear Mart award\n  * 1990: Fashion Institute of Technology President's award\n  * 1992: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n\n## Works and publications[\u3010110\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * Weitz, John.

The last thing I want is to be controlled by fashion.\" No one would say\u2014and certainly no one would dare say in his presence\u2014that Weitz is controlled by fashion. Rather he has treated fashion as a chosen field, one among many. He abandoned the competitive field of womenswear for a mannerly, self-invented calling in menswear. Even there, he stayed slightly aloof, choosing to be the debonair gentleman rather than fashion victim/victimizer. He has two rare personalities\u2014a late New York intellectual and a natural aristocrat who has seen aristocracies disintegrate, but who persists in imagining new ones.\n\nSince the 1940s, Weitz has spoken a gentlemanly common sense about fashion for men and women. First encouraged by Dorothy Shaver of Lord & Taylor in the 1940s to pursue women's sportswear with his demanding sense of a contemporary postwar lifestyle, Weitz carried his marrow of American practicality within the genteel spirit of his own European and English cultivation. As much a man of letters and ideas as of fashion, once an adventurer who drove race cars and was solicited to portray James Bond, Weitz is a consummate gentleman in the sometimes less than genteel world of fashion.\n\nWhile his great achievements in apparel in the 1950s were of women's sportswear, he became one of the first men's fashion designers in the early 1960s, shifting his emphasis to this field for its capability to fulfill his interest in classic looks, utmost practicality, and no-nonsense durability. Until \u301025\u2020Giorgio Armani\u3011 and \u301026\u2020Ralph Lauren\u3011 in the late 1970s and 1980s, no designer was as faithful as Weitz to menswear. In personal style as well as his design, Weitz exemplified the refined but unpretentious good taste that comes of humane attention to what is important in life, with clothing following as a consequence of those values. Even in the extreme years of menswear in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Weitz's vision was always tempered.\n\nIf Weitz was first a visionary of the disciplines of sportswear for women in America, he transferred his allegiance to menswear in the early 1960s when a number of designers were testing the waters of menswear, among them Geoffrey Beene and \u301027\u2020Bill Blass\u3011 in America, Hardy Amies in \u301028\u2020England\u3011, and \u301029\u2020Pierre Cardin\u3011 in \u301030\u2020France\u3011. Weitz alone gave his primary attention to menswear, a field where his own principal ideas had first come from observing the Duke of Windsor. Long before absorbing and ultimately creating the ethos of sportswear, Weitz had been an assistant to Molyneux in London. There, he was a part of fashion that was fastidious, client-driven, and rich in protocol and money.\n\nWhen asked in Interview (March 1983) if he considered himself a couturier, Weitz replied, \"Good God, no. I'm a modern-day creature that emerged from an old couture assistant into a sort of inventive concept, which I don't mind at all.\" His acumen for business and licensing has enabled Weitz to build an empire in menswear with a minimum of participation from the designer. His own engaging and cosmopolitan charm establishes only the guidelines for product development. In many ways, Weitz was the first to be such a designer\u2014god-like then thereafter far removed from the world of his own creation. Weitz makes a point, however, of wearing his own clothes; this is a matter of honor for a man of Boy Scoutish, even knightly, integrity.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century Weitz still offered a graceful conceptual model of a fashion designer, though he had significantly segued into other professions as well. As an author of several books, both novels and historical biographies, the designer had been spending more time writing than sketching\n\n\"Dress is a form of tribalism,\" Weitz commented to Forbes (5 May 1997), \"People wear what their tribe wears\u2014executives, blue-collar workers, undertakers, accountants. They want to feel tribally appropriate. Distinguishing yourself within your tribe is a matter of style, not fashion.\"\n\n\"\u2026I never planned on being a great couturier,\" says Weitz, who switched to menswear in 1964. \"To me fashion is not an art but a craft\u2026.\" told People (Oct 26, 1992) While Weitz himself is a longtime member of internationally best-dressed Hall of Fame, his long wool coats still sell as do his tailored men's shirts, socks, and a host of other accessories.\n\n\u2014Richard Martin\n\nContemporary Fashion\n\n\u00d7\n\nCite this article    \nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\n  * MLA\n  * Chicago\n  * APA\n\n\"\u301031\u2020Weitz, John .\u3011\" Contemporary Fashion. .

              "snippet": "\n### Writer[\u301090\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nFrom 1970 to the 1990s, Weitz wrote both fiction and historical non-fiction, much centered on Nazi-era Germany. He also wrote frequent magazine articles on a variety of subjects, including his hobby as a race car driver.[23] Weitz raced at \u301091\u2020Sebring International Raceway\u3011 from 1955 to 1957,[12] as well as the Bahamas Grand Prix Circuit.[6]\n\nWhile spending time on Long Island, Weitz was encouraged by the writer \u301092\u2020John Steinbeck\u3011 to write. His early novels were bestsellers.[24] While his early novels were semi-autobiographical, including focuses on style, the fashion business, and his experiences in Germany, his latter non-fiction books were serious biographies of \u301093\u2020Joachim von Ribbentrop\u3011,[25] Foreign Minister of \u301094\u2020Third Reich\u3011, and \u301095\u2020Hjalmar Schacht\u3011,[26] President of the \u301096\u2020Reichsbank\u3011 and Minister of Economics.[24]\n\n## Personal life[\u301097\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nWeitz was married three times. His first marriage, from 1944 to 1953, was to Sally Blauner Gould.[27] He had married Blauner when he was 20 years old. Blauner was from \u301098\u2020Philadelphia\u3011, \u301099\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011, and her family owned the Blauner's department store chain.[18] He had a daughter and son with Gould, Karen Weitz Curtis and Robert Weitz. In 1964, Weitz separated from his second wife, Eve Orton, who was a fashion editor.[28]\n\nIn 1964, Weitz met actress \u301051\u2020Susan Kohner\u3011 in \u3010100\u2020Palm Beach\u3011, \u3010101\u2020Florida\u3011. Kohner's father was a well known talent agent named \u301055\u2020Paul Kohner\u3011; her mother was actress \u301054\u2020Lupita Tovar\u3011.[7] Weitz married Kohner in 1964.[29] They had two sons, directors \u301052\u2020Paul Weitz\u3011 and \u301053\u2020Chris Weitz\u3011.[3]\n\nIn addition to his race car driving hobby, Weitz enjoyed boating, and was a member of yacht clubs in Palm Beach, East Hampton, Sag Harbor, as well as part of the US Naval Academy Sailing Squadron.[21]\n\n## Awards[\u3010102\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * 1959: \u3010103\u2020Sports Illustrated\u3011 award[30]\n  * 1960: NBC \u3010104\u2020Today Show\u3011 award\n  * 1964-1967: \u3010105\u2020Caswell-Massey Awards\u3011[19]\n  * 1966: \u3010106\u2020Harper's Bazaar\u3011 Medallion\n  * 1967: Moscow Diploma\n  * 1974: \u3010107\u2020Coty American Fashion Critics' Award\u3011\n  * 1975: Brilliant Pen Award (MFI)\n  * 1981: Cartier Award for Design Excellence\n  * 1986: Cutty Sark Menswear Award\n  * 1986: Mayor's Liberty Award\n  * 1988: \u3010108\u2020Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\u3011\n  * 1990: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n  * 1990: Dallas Menswear Mart award\n  * 1990: Fashion Institute of Technology President's award\n  * 1992: \u3010109\u2020Ellis Island Medal of Honor\u3011\n\n## Works and publications[\u3010110\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * Weitz, John.

The last thing I want is to be controlled by fashion.\" No one would say\u2014and certainly no one would dare say in his presence\u2014that Weitz is controlled by fashion. Rather he has treated fashion as a chosen field, one among many. He abandoned the competitive field of womenswear for a mannerly, self-invented calling in menswear. Even there, he stayed slightly aloof, choosing to be the debonair gentleman rather than fashion victim/victimizer. He has two rare personalities\u2014a late New York intellectual and a natural aristocrat who has seen aristocracies disintegrate, but who persists in imagining new ones.\n\nSince the 1940s, Weitz has spoken a gentlemanly common sense about fashion for men and women. First encouraged by Dorothy Shaver of Lord & Taylor in the 1940s to pursue women's sportswear with his demanding sense of a contemporary postwar lifestyle, Weitz carried his marrow of American practicality within the genteel spirit of his own European and English cultivation. As much a man of letters and ideas as of fashion, once an adventurer who drove race cars and was solicited to portray James Bond, Weitz is a consummate gentleman in the sometimes less than genteel world of fashion.\n\nWhile his great achievements in apparel in the 1950s were of women's sportswear, he became one of the first men's fashion designers in the early 1960s, shifting his emphasis to this field for its capability to fulfill his interest in classic looks, utmost practicality, and no-nonsense durability. Until \u301025\u2020Giorgio Armani\u3011 and \u301026\u2020Ralph Lauren\u3011 in the late 1970s and 1980s, no designer was as faithful as Weitz to menswear. In personal style as well as his design, Weitz exemplified the refined but unpretentious good taste that comes of humane attention to what is important in life, with clothing following as a consequence of those values. Even in the extreme years of menswear in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Weitz's vision was always tempered.\n\nIf Weitz was first a visionary of the disciplines of sportswear for women in America, he transferred his allegiance to menswear in the early 1960s when a number of designers were testing the waters of menswear, among them Geoffrey Beene and \u301027\u2020Bill Blass\u3011 in America, Hardy Amies in \u301028\u2020England\u3011, and \u301029\u2020Pierre Cardin\u3011 in \u301030\u2020France\u3011. Weitz alone gave his primary attention to menswear, a field where his own principal ideas had first come from observing the Duke of Windsor. Long before absorbing and ultimately creating the ethos of sportswear, Weitz had been an assistant to Molyneux in London. There, he was a part of fashion that was fastidious, client-driven, and rich in protocol and money.\n\nWhen asked in Interview (March 1983) if he considered himself a couturier, Weitz replied, \"Good God, no. I'm a modern-day creature that emerged from an old couture assistant into a sort of inventive concept, which I don't mind at all.\" His acumen for business and licensing has enabled Weitz to build an empire in menswear with a minimum of participation from the designer. His own engaging and cosmopolitan charm establishes only the guidelines for product development. In many ways, Weitz was the first to be such a designer\u2014god-like then thereafter far removed from the world of his own creation. Weitz makes a point, however, of wearing his own clothes; this is a matter of honor for a man of Boy Scoutish, even knightly, integrity.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century Weitz still offered a graceful conceptual model of a fashion designer, though he had significantly segued into other professions as well. As an author of several books, both novels and historical biographies, the designer had been spending more time writing than sketching\n\n\"Dress is a form of tribalism,\" Weitz commented to Forbes (5 May 1997), \"People wear what their tribe wears\u2014executives, blue-collar workers, undertakers, accountants. They want to feel tribally appropriate. Distinguishing yourself within your tribe is a matter of style, not fashion.\"\n\n\"\u2026I never planned on being a great couturier,\" says Weitz, who switched to menswear in 1964. \"To me fashion is not an art but a craft\u2026.\" told People (Oct 26, 1992) While Weitz himself is a longtime member of internationally best-dressed Hall of Fame, his long wool coats still sell as do his tailored men's shirts, socks, and a host of other accessories.\n\n\u2014Richard Martin\n\nContemporary Fashion\n\n\u00d7\n\nCite this article    \nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\n  * MLA\n  * Chicago\n  * APA\n\n\"\u301031\u2020Weitz, John .\u3011\" Contemporary Fashion. .
