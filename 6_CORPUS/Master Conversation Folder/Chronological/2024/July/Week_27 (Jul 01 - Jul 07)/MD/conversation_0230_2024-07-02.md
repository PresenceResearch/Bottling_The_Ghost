The part where it is specified that the client does not need to be informed of minor changes is located in Section 15 (Submittals) of the contract:

> If any design Work requires delivery of any submittal to the Customer, then the Customer shall make reasonable efforts to review such submittal and provide comments (or approvals) to Lumina within a reasonable time, not to exceed five (5) business days after delivery by Lumina provided that the notice by Lumina indicates that the proposal would be deemed approved if no objection is made to Lumina within five (5) business days. If Customer has not responded within such five (5) business day period, then every day of delay shall be deemed a delay by Customer and shall extend, day by day, the period for completion of the Project under this Contract. Lumina shall undertake to rectify the design materials and documents and resubmit for the Customer’s review, comment and approval, as appropriate (determined by Lumina in its discretion), giving due consideration to such comments and making reasonable changes or corrections as may be required or requested by the Customer; provided, however, that Lumina shall be under no obligation to accommodate any comment, request or requirement that is not consistent with applicable standards, good industry practices, or applicable Law【7:0†source】.

This section effectively implies that minor changes which do not significantly deviate from industry standards or applicable laws might not require explicit approval from the client.

The contract specifies changes in size and how they should be handled in Section 18 (Change Orders):

> 18. Change Orders. Any and all changes to the Work shall be agreed upon bilaterally via addendum or amendment to this Contract. The occurrence of any event or occurrence under this Section 18 shall be a basis for a change to the Work for which the Customer is responsible to adjust the costs and or timeline for completion of the Work. Any cost relief to which Lumina is entitled shall be net of insurance proceeds actually received, to be accounted in arrears.

Further, it specifies details about system design components and panel count in Section 5:

> 5. System Design Components. Exhibit B sets forth an initial list of module count and inverter sizing for the Project as intended to be installed at Project Location on the Property. Each party will agree to panel count after the physical site and electrical survey has been completed and thereafter engineering documents have been designed.

These sections indicate that changes in size and other significant alterations require bilateral agreement and may involve adjusting costs or timelines accordingly  .

The contract specifies the following changes do not need to be explicitly approved by the customer:

1. **Submittals**:
   - If the customer does not respond to a design submittal within five (5) business days, the submittal is deemed approved【7:0†source】.

2. **Discretionary Design Adjustments**:
   - Lumina is not obligated to accommodate comments or requests that are not consistent with applicable standards, good industry practices, or applicable laws【7:0†source】.

In general, minor changes or adjustments that fall within the industry standards, good practices, and legal compliance do not require explicit customer approval if the customer does not object within the specified timeframe.

In the contract, interconnection efforts are mentioned, and it states that the customer shall reasonably and timely assist Lumina in performance of the work, which includes interconnection efforts. Here are the relevant sections:

- **Customer Obligations**:
  - "Customer shall reasonably and timely assist Lumina in performance of the Work (e.g., assist with permit applications, interconnection efforts, access to the Property, etc.)" .

- **Included Services**:
  - "Apply for interconnection, and facilitate interconnection, of the Projects with the applicable utility company and schedule meter replacement services, as may be required" .

While these sections specify that the customer needs to assist with interconnection efforts, there is no explicit mention that minor changes to interconnection do not require customer approval. However, general minor changes that fall within the industry standards, good practices, and legal compliance may not require explicit customer approval if the customer does not object within the specified timeframe as indicated in the general conditions of the contract.
