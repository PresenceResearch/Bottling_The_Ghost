In Maryland, you can typically drive a newly purchased car using the insurance from your existing car for a short period, often 30 days, to allow you time to add the new vehicle to your policy. However, it's important to check with your insurance company to confirm their specific requirements and ensure you have the appropriate coverage for your new car.

The 2012 Kia Forte EX has had several recalls over the years. Here are some key recalls you should be aware of:

1. **Engine Compartment Fire Risk**: This recall affects a significant number of Kia vehicles, including the 2012 Forte. The issue involves a risk of an engine compartment fire while the car is parked or driving, increasing the risk of injury【13†source】【14†source】.

2. **Brake Pedal Stopper Pad Deterioration**: The brake pedal stopper pad may deteriorate, causing the brake lights to stay on even when the brake pedal is not pressed. This can also allow the shift lever to be moved without depressing the brake pedal, increasing the risk of a crash. Kia dealers will replace the brake pedal stopper pad for free【14†source】.

3. **Engine Damage Leading to Fire**: Another recall involves potential engine damage that could lead to a fire, affecting a large number of vehicles. This recall was announced in December 2020 and involves inspecting and repairing the engine as necessary to prevent this risk【13†source】.

For detailed information and to check if your specific vehicle is affected, you can visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website and enter your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to see all applicable recalls. It's also a good idea to contact a Kia dealer to ensure all necessary repairs are completed.
