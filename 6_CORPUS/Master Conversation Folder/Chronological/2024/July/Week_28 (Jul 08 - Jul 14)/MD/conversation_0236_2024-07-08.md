Analyzing PEPCO commercial electricity prices in the District of Columbia over the last 15 years shows a trend of periodic increases and adjustments reflective of market conditions and regulatory decisions. Historical data from the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) reveals that Pepco's Standard Offer Service (SOS) rates for electricity have seen fluctuations, with a mix of rate hikes and reductions over this period. Notably, Pepco announced significant price increases for 2023-2024, with commercial customers expected to see their rates jump by at least 66% compared to the previous year【6†source】【7†source】.

Future projections for the next ten years indicate that commercial electricity rates will likely continue to rise. The DCPSC has approved a multi-year rate plan for Pepco, authorizing the utility to recover $108.6 million through higher rates, translating to continued increases in electricity costs for consumers【8†source】【9†source】.

In terms of approved rate increases over the next few years, the DCPSC has already sanctioned a structured increase in Pepco's rates. These adjustments are part of a broader plan to enhance service reliability and fund critical infrastructure projects. For instance, there are planned average monthly increases of $3.66 in 2022 and another $1.54 in 2023【9†source】.

For a detailed and up-to-date understanding of current and future electricity rates, it is advisable to refer to the DCPSC's official releases and Pepco's announcements, as they provide comprehensive insights into approved rate changes and the factors influencing them.
