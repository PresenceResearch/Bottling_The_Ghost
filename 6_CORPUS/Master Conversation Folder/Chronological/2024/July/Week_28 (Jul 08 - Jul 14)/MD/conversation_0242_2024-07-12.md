please make this more concise Oleg - thanks for passing along.  My thoughts below:
The only problem I have with the family next door is that the kids are really loud.  This has gotten better but it still happens, and as far as I'm concerned there's nothing we can do here.  I think the kids are very sweet and love talking with them, my guess is that they are just bored in the house and are letting off some steam.  It's annoying and sometimes it's disruptive but at the end of the day I"m not really sure about what anyone can do about it.  As far as I'm concerned this is not an issue we can solve so I don't want to waste my time talking about it.  
Here are the issues the landlord can control:Mice/rats: I have mice in my house, I have seen them and have seen their droppings.  This is the first time I have ever had mice and have lived here for 4 years and given the scratching I can sometimes hear coming from the wall adjacent to this house I'm assuming that they are in there too.  I suppose this can't be proven but the evidence is pretty strong.  We can ask that the landlord to take some sort of measures to alleviate this problem - have an exterminator come and shore up the entry points, traps etc.  This should have a positive effect on both your house and mine.Back yard - the landlord can either landscape or remove the weeds that are overgrowing into your yard.  It looks terrible and is invading your space.  This is his responsibility so he should fix it.Front yard - same thing.  Trim or remove the overgrown weeds/bushes that are starting to cover my house.  It's ugly and makes my house look bad, and is his responsibility to remedy.Overall appearance of the front - The shingles are literally falling off of the front of the house and it looks terrible and it is frankly embarrassing.  Simply replacing a few shingles is actually going to make it look worse and more shingles will continue to fall, so frankly it needs a whole replacement.  
So to review - my specific asks would be:Eliminate the mice / shore up entry pointsclean / landscape back yard where it abuts your fenceclean / landscape front yard, removing weeds/tree that are crossing onto my propertyReplace roof or significantly repair so that the shingle issues are permanently resolved.  Let me know if I can do anything to help here,

Oleg, thanks for passing this along. My thoughts:

The main issue with the family next door is their loud kids. While it has improved, it still happens and there's little we can do. The kids are sweet and just bored, so while it's annoying, it's not something we can solve. I don't want to waste time discussing it further.

Here are the issues the landlord can address:

1. **Mice/Rats**: I've seen mice and their droppings in my house for the first time in four years. Given the scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor's house, it's likely they have them too. The landlord should hire an exterminator to address this, which will benefit both houses.

2. **Back Yard**: The landlord needs to landscape or remove the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. It's his responsibility to fix this.

3. **Front Yard**: The landlord should trim or remove the overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house. It's ugly and his responsibility to remedy.

4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles are falling off the front of the house, making it look terrible. Simply replacing a few shingles will make it worse, so the entire roof needs replacement.

To review, my specific requests are:
- Eliminate the mice and shore up entry points.
- Clean/landscape the back yard where it abuts your fence.
- Clean/landscape the front yard, removing weeds/trees crossing onto my property.
- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues.

Let me know if I can help with anything.

**Assistant:**

Oleg, thanks for passing this along. Here are my concerns:

The primary issue with the family next door is the noise from their children. While it has somewhat improved, it remains a problem. The children are simply bored and trying to entertain themselves. Though it can be disruptive, this is not something within our control, and further discussion on this matter is not productive.

Here are the actionable issues the landlord must address:

1. **Mice/Rats**: I have observed mice and their droppings in my house, a first in my four years of residence. Additionally, I hear scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor’s house, suggesting an infestation there as well. The landlord must take immediate action by hiring an exterminator to eliminate this problem and secure entry points. This will mitigate the issue for both properties.

2. **Back Yard**: The landlord is responsible for landscaping and removing the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. This must be addressed promptly as it infringes on your property.

3. **Front Yard**: The overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house are unsightly and unacceptable. The landlord must trim or remove them to maintain the property’s appearance.

4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles are falling off the front of the house, creating an eyesore and potential hazard. A mere patch job will not suffice; the entire roof requires replacement to prevent further deterioration.

To summarize, my specific demands are:
- Eliminate the mice and secure entry points.
- Clean and landscape the back yard, especially where it abuts your fence.
- Clean and landscape the front yard, removing any weeds or trees encroaching on my property.
- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues permanently.

I expect prompt action on these matters. Please inform me if there are any steps I can take to facilitate these resolutions.

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-12 17:11:16*

Oleg, thanks for passing this along. Here are my demands:

The main issue with the family next door is the incessant noise from their children. Although there has been some improvement, it remains a disturbance. While I understand that the children are bored and trying to entertain themselves, this disruption cannot continue, and any further discussion on this matter is pointless.

The following are the landlord's responsibilities that must be addressed immediately:

1. **Mice/Rats**: I have found mice and their droppings in my house for the first time in four years. The scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor's house suggest an infestation there as well. The landlord must hire an exterminator to eradicate this issue and secure entry points. Failure to act will result in further complaints and potential legal action.

2. **Back Yard**: The landlord must address the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. This is an infringement on your property and must be resolved immediately.

3. **Front Yard**: The overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house are unsightly and unacceptable. The landlord must trim or remove them to maintain the property's appearance and avoid further degradation.

4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles falling off the front of the house are an eyesore and pose a potential hazard. A patch job will not suffice; the entire roof requires replacement to prevent further issues. If not addressed, this will lead to further action.

To summarize, my demands are:
- Eliminate the mice and secure entry points immediately.
- Clean and landscape the back yard where it abuts your fence without delay.
- Clean and landscape the front yard, removing weeds and trees encroaching on my property immediately.
- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues permanently.

Immediate action is expected on these matters. Failure to comply will result in escalation and potential legal action. Let me know if I can assist in ensuring these issues are resolved promptly.

Oleg, thanks for passing this along. Here are my thoughts and demands:

The primary issue with the family next door is the noise from their children. While there has been some improvement, it remains a problem. The children are very sweet and friendly, and I understand they are simply bored and trying to entertain themselves. Though it can be disruptive, this is not something within our control, and further discussion on this matter is not productive.

However, there are several serious issues that the landlord must address immediately, as they pertain to the health, safety, and overall well-being of the tenants:

1. **Mice/Rats**: I have observed mice and their droppings in my house, which is a first in my four years of residence here. Additionally, I hear scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor’s house, suggesting an infestation there as well. According to Baltimore County Code § 13-7-112, landlords are required to maintain their properties in a habitable condition, which includes ensuring the premises are free from rodents and other pests. Failure to address this issue constitutes a violation of this code and presents a serious health hazard to tenants. The presence of mice and their droppings is not only unsanitary but also poses risks of disease. The landlord must hire an exterminator immediately to eliminate this problem and secure all entry points. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in fines and further legal action.

2. **Back Yard**: The landlord is responsible for maintaining the property, including landscaping and removing the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. This overgrowth infringes on your property and must be addressed promptly.

3. **Front Yard**: The overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house are unsightly and unacceptable. According to Baltimore County regulations, property owners must keep their properties in a condition that does not adversely affect neighboring properties. The landlord must trim or remove these overgrowths to maintain the property’s appearance and prevent further degradation.

4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles falling off the front of the house are creating an eyesore and potential hazard. This situation also falls under the maintenance obligations of the landlord, as stipulated in Baltimore County Code § 13-7-112, which requires landlords to keep the exterior of the property in good repair. A mere patch job will not suffice; the entire roof requires replacement to prevent further deterioration.

To summarize, my specific demands are:
- Eliminate the mice and secure all entry points immediately. Failure to do so will result in filing complaints with Baltimore County authorities and pursuing further legal action.
- Clean and landscape the back yard, especially where it abuts your fence.
- Clean and landscape the front yard, removing any weeds or trees encroaching on my property.
- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues permanently.

Immediate action is expected on these matters. Non-compliance will result in further complaints to Baltimore County Code Enforcement and legal action to enforce these requirements. Please inform me if there are any steps I can take to facilitate these resolutions.
