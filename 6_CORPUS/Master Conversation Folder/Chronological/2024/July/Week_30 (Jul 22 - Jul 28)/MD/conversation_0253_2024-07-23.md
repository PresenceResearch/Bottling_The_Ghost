Given that this portrait is hanging in a house in Lee, Massachusetts, it's possible that the person depicted could be a historical figure or an ancestor related to the region. Lee, Massachusetts, has a rich history dating back to its founding in 1777.

Here are a few steps you could take to potentially identify the man in the portrait:

1. **Local Historical Society**: Contact the Lee Historical Society. They may have records or archives that could help identify the person.

2. **Family History**: If the house has been in a family for a long time, family records or genealogy could provide clues.

3. **Library Archives**: Check local libraries for historical documents, old photographs, or town records.

4. **Online Databases**: Use online ancestry or historical photo databases. Websites like Ancestry.com or FamilySearch.org could have similar images or records.

5. **Town Hall Records**: Local town halls often keep historical records that might include portraits of notable figures in the community.

If you have any additional details about the house or the family associated with it, that might provide further clues.
