The Carby Musk fragrance, part of Drake's Better World Fragrance House, has garnered attention for its unique scent profile and high-quality composition. Described as a luxurious blend, it features top notes of floral scents, mid notes of amber, and a dry down of musk. The fragrance is available both as a candle and a perfume oil.

Reviewers highlight its sophisticated and lingering aroma, which combines velvet, powdery musks with soft floral, amber, and marine undertones. This makes it a versatile and appealing scent that leaves a lasting impression【6†source】【8†source】【9†source】.
