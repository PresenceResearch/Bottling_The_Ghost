The WTMD Board of Directors is part of Baltimore Public Media, which also operates WYPR. Information about the board and its meetings is available on the Baltimore Public Media website. The board has recently undergone significant changes, with most members resigning following the dismissal of a long-time general manager. This has led to a reconstitution of the board by Towson University Public Media【6†source】【7†source】【8†source】【9†source】.
