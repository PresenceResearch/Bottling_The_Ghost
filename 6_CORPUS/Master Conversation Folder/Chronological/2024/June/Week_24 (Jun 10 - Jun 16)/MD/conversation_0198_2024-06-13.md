A good starter bike for someone who wants to start riding for exercise should be comfortable, reliable, and easy to use. Here are a few recommendations:

1. **Hybrid Bikes**: These bikes combine features of road and mountain bikes, making them versatile for various terrains. They are generally comfortable and have a more upright riding position, which is good for beginners. 
   - Example: **Trek FX 1** or **Giant Escape 3**.

2. **Road Bikes**: If you plan to ride primarily on paved roads and are interested in longer distances or higher speeds, a road bike might be suitable. Look for entry-level models that offer a balance of performance and comfort.
   - Example: **Specialized Allez** or **Cannondale Synapse**.

3. **Mountain Bikes**: If you prefer off-road trails and rugged terrain, a mountain bike is a great choice. Entry-level models are durable and can handle rougher paths.
   - Example: **Trek Marlin 5** or **Giant Talon 3**.

4. **Comfort Bikes**: These are designed specifically for casual riding and comfort. They often feature wider seats, cushioned saddles, and an upright riding position.
   - Example: **Schwinn Discover** or **Electra Townie 7D**.

5. **Electric Bikes**: If you want some assistance with pedaling, especially on hills, an electric bike can be a great option. They provide a boost when needed and can make riding more enjoyable for beginners.
   - Example: **Rad Power RadCity** or **Specialized Turbo Vado**.

When choosing a bike, it's important to consider factors such as the type of riding you'll be doing, your budget, and ensuring the bike fits you properly. Many bike shops offer test rides, which can help you find the best fit and style for your needs.
