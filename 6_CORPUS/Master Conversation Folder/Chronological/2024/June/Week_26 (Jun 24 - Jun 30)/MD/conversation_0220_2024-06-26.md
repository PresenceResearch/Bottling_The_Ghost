sort the salesforce data by the same criteria Ohm uses to categorize metro area (I think it's by county)Create a report broken down by metro area an salesforce with the following metrics # of leadsConversion rate of leads# of opportunitiesClosed categories by percentage by metro areaClosed Won # of Closed WonType of financingAvg deal size (kW and $$)Avg GM per deal (% and/or $)% of overall installs in municipality (what is our market share?)Lumina system sizes compared to averageFinancing types compared by averageAvg system size, price and GM per financing typeClosed/LostBreak down by municipalityIf we have the data compare our specific competitor losses by competitor # of installs Compare total Lumina Installs with # of competitor installs.  Take that ratio and compare to our closed/lost: competitor numbers.  IF those numbers are less than the ratio of Lumina/Competitor losses we can take the unresponsives and extrapolate how many of those were actually lost to competitors.If possible include census data (median household income etc) and layer on top of the sales numbers we have above.  How much GM do we make in richer counties?  How much GM do we make in the less affluent areas?  Generally, pitching PPA's to less affluent households is actually more profitable than going after the big rich people who pay cash because the rich folk are more savvy buyersCompare Lumina Sales to municipality saturation rate% of installs done by Lumina compared to saturation rateBreak down by metrics used above for example:Use this data to determine which product is most profitable in which county and where we perform well.  look at cost of customer acquisition per county per deal typeCalculate $/WAtt marketing to $/WAtt installed $/WAtt GMCalculate how much marketing spend increase would increase Lumina market share by xx% and what that would historically yield.Finally - look for counties with similar traits. characteristics and saturation rates and apply Lumina's cost structure to these counties.  As an added bonus adjust GM per mile of extra drive time.

Creating a detailed spreadsheet report with the metrics specified involves generating and organizing a lot of data. Here is a conceptual framework of how the spreadsheet could look, populated with made-up numbers to illustrate the structure:

### Summary Report Breakdown by Metro Area

**Metrics:**
1. Number of Leads
2. Conversion Rate of Leads
3. Number of Opportunities
4. Closed Categories by Percentage by Metro Area
5. Closed Won
6. Number of Closed Won
7. Type of Financing
8. Average Deal Size (kW and $$)
9. Average GM per Deal (% and/or $)
10. % of Overall Installs in Municipality (Market Share)
11. Lumina System Sizes Compared to Average
12. Financing Types Compared by Average
13. Average System Size, Price, and GM per Financing Type
14. Closed/Lost
15. Breakdown by Municipality
16. Competitor Analysis
17. Census Data Analysis (Income, GM in Richer vs. Less Affluent Areas)
18. Customer Acquisition Cost per County per Deal Type
19. $/Watt Marketing to $/Watt Installed, $/Watt GM
20. Impact of Increased Marketing Spend on Market Share
21. County Comparison with Similar Traits

### Example Data

Here’s an example of how this data could be structured in a spreadsheet format:

This conceptual framework organizes the data as per the requested metrics. The actual spreadsheet can be created using this structure, filling in with real data from Salesforce and other sources. 

Would you like me to generate a sample spreadsheet file using these example metrics?
