A solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a contract between you and a solar provider where they install solar panels on your property at no upfront cost. You agree to purchase the electricity generated by the panels at a predetermined rate, usually lower than your current utility rate, for a fixed period, typically 10-25 years. This allows you to save on electricity bills while reducing your carbon footprint.
