            "An SREC, or Solar Renewable Energy Certificate, is a tradable credit that represents the environmental benefits of generating one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity from a solar energy system. SRECs are used in several states in the U.S. to help meet Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) or similar regulatory requirements, which mandate that a certain percentage of the electricity sold by utilities come from renewable sources.\n\n### Key Points about SRECs:\n- **Generation**: SRECs are generated by solar energy systems based on the amount of electricity they produce. For example, a solar system that generates 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity will earn one SREC.\n- **Trading**: SRECs can be bought and sold on the open market. Solar system owners can sell their SRECs to utilities or other entities that need to meet renewable energy requirements.\n- **Value**: The value of an SREC can vary widely depending on the supply and demand dynamics in the market, as well as state-specific regulations and incentives.\n- **Revenue Stream**: For solar system owners, SRECs can provide an additional revenue stream on top of savings from reduced electricity bills.\n- **Compliance**: Utilities and other electricity suppliers buy SRECs to comply with state RPS requirements, which helps drive demand for these certificates.\n\nIn summary, SRECs incentivize the generation of solar energy by providing a financial mechanism for recognizing and trading the environmental benefits of solar power."
