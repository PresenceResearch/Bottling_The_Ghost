It looks like there was an issue generating the chart. Let's refine the request and try again. How about a "chart depicting rapid solar growth in the US over the next decade"? Does that sound good?

It looks like we're still experiencing some technical difficulties. Let's break down the request further. I'll create a "chart showing solar growth trends in the US over the next 10 years." Does that work for you?

**You:**

yes

**Assistant:**

It seems we're still having trouble generating the design. Let's try one last time with a simpler approach. I'll request a "solar growth chart for the US." This should help narrow it down. Does that sound okay?

**You:**

*2024-05-19 20:31:33*

ok
