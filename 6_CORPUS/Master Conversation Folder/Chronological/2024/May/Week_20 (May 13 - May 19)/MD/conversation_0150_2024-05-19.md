  "prompt": "A detailed illustration showing how solar net metering works. The image includes a house with solar panels on the roof, a utility meter, and an electric grid connection. The solar panels are shown generating electricity which flows into the house. Part of the electricity is used by the house, and the excess electricity flows through the utility meter back into the electric grid. Arrows and labels are used to indicate the direction of electricity flow and the key components: solar panels, inverter, utility meter, and the electric grid. The background includes a sunny sky and a few clouds, emphasizing the use of solar energy.",
