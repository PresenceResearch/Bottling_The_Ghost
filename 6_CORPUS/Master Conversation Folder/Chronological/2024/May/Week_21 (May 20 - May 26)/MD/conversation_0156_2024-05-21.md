Potomac Edison, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp, has received approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) for a $28 million rate adjustment. This change, effective from October 18, 2023, aims to support ongoing service reliability improvements, such as tree trimming, equipment inspections, and maintenance to prevent power outages during severe weather conditions. 

For commercial customers in Washington County, this rate adjustment will result in an overall increase of 3.5% in their electric bills starting in early 2024. This increase is somewhat mitigated by a decrease in the Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS). Despite these changes, Potomac Edison customers will continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies【6†source】【7†source】.
