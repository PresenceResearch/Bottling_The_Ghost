Certainly! To calculate the 60% bonus depreciation for a solar panel system over 5 years, accounting for the 30% federal tax credit, you can follow these steps in Excel. Let's assume the cost of the solar panel system is in cell `A1`.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation**: Subtract the 30% federal tax credit.
2. **Bonus Depreciation Calculation**: Apply the 60% bonus depreciation.
3. **Remaining Depreciation Calculation**: Depreciate the remaining amount over the remaining years.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Cost after Tax Credit**:
   ```excel
   =A1 * (1 - 0.30)
   ```
   This formula calculates the cost of the solar panel system after applying the 30% federal tax credit.

2. **Bonus Depreciation**:
   ```excel
   =B1 * 0.60
   ```
   This formula calculates the 60% bonus depreciation based on the cost after the tax credit.

3. **Remaining Amount after Bonus Depreciation**:
   ```excel
   =B1 - C1
   ```
   This formula calculates the remaining amount after applying the bonus depreciation.

4. **Annual Depreciation for Remaining Amount (over 5 years)**:
   ```excel
   =D1 / 5
   ```
   This formula calculates the annual depreciation for the remaining amount over 5 years.

Let's put it all together in an Excel sheet. Assume `A1` contains the initial cost of the solar panel system.

- **A1**: Initial Cost of Solar Panel System
- **B1**: Cost after 30% Federal Tax Credit
- **C1**: 60% Bonus Depreciation
- **D1**: Remaining Amount after Bonus Depreciation
- **E1**: Annual Depreciation (for 5 years)

Here are the formulas:

- **A1**: `Initial Cost of Solar Panel System` (Enter this value manually)
- **B1**: `=A1 * (1 - 0.30)`
- **C1**: `=B1 * 0.60`
- **D1**: `=B1 - C1`
- **E1**: `=D1 / 5`

If you want to see the depreciation schedule over 5 years, you can set up additional rows:

- **F1**: Year
- **G1**: Depreciation Amount

In cells F2 to F6 (for years 1 to 5), and G2 to G6 (for annual depreciation):

- **F2 to F6**: Enter `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` respectively.
- **G2**: `=$E$1` (Drag this formula down to G6 to apply the same annual depreciation for each year)

The final Excel sheet would look something like this:

|   A   |       B       |      C       |       D        |       E        |   F   |        G         |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------|------------------|
| 10000 | =A1 * 0.7     | =B1 * 0.60   | =B1 - C1       | =D1 / 5        | Year  | Depreciation Amt |
|       |               |              |                |                | 1     | =$E$1            |
|       |               |              |                |                | 2     | =$E$1            |
|       |               |              |                |                | 3     | =$E$1            |
|       |               |              |                |                | 4     | =$E$1            |
|       |               |              |                |                | 5     | =$E$1            |

This setup will help you calculate and see the depreciation over 5 years after accounting for the federal tax credit and bonus depreciation.
