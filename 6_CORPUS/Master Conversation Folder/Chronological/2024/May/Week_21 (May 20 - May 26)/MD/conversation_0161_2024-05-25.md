To clean and stop sap bleeding through the wood on your deck, follow these steps:

### Cleaning the Sap
1. **Gather Materials**:
   - Mineral spirits or rubbing alcohol
   - Clean cloths or paper towels
   - Soap and water
   - Sandpaper (optional, for stubborn spots)

2. **Apply Mineral Spirits or Rubbing Alcohol**:
   - Dampen a cloth with mineral spirits or rubbing alcohol.
   - Gently rub the sap spot, allowing the solvent to dissolve the sap.
   - Wipe away the dissolved sap with a clean cloth.

3. **Wash the Area**:
   - After removing the sap, wash the area with soap and water to remove any residue from the solvent.
   - Rinse thoroughly and let it dry completely.

4. **Sand if Necessary**:
   - If the sap stain is stubborn, lightly sand the area with fine-grit sandpaper.
   - Clean off the dust and debris after sanding.

### Preventing Sap Bleeding
1. **Seal the Wood**:
   - Apply a high-quality exterior wood sealer or stain to the deck. Look for products specifically designed to block sap.
   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times.

2. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Regularly check the deck for any new sap spots and clean them promptly.
   - Reapply the wood sealer as recommended, typically every 1-3 years, to maintain protection.

These steps should help in cleaning the existing sap and reducing the chances of future sap bleeding through the wood.
