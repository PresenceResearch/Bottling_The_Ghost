I want to plan a trip from march 15-21 2025.  It will be two adults and an 18 year old boy and a 14 year old girl.  I would like it to be somewhere warm, but not the traditional trip to cancun, jamaica etc.  I would like the opportunity to spend some time on the beach relaxing and also doing some interesting activities either in a city or in nature.  I would like to try to go to central America or a place in Mexico that is not very touristy.  And just for fun tell me about a trip to vietnam

Ah, I can feel the warm breeze and smell the salty sea air already! Let’s dive into some exciting destinations that offer the perfect balance of relaxation and adventure, away from the usual tourist crowds.

### Central America or Non-Touristy Mexico

#### 1. **Huatulco, Mexico**
   - **Why it’s perfect**: Huatulco, located in Oaxaca, Mexico, is a hidden gem with stunning beaches along the Pacific coast and rich biodiversity in its surroundings. It's far less touristy than Cancun but still offers beautiful beaches with crystal-clear water.
   - **Beaches**: The Bahías de Huatulco has nine breathtaking bays, many of which are undeveloped and tranquil, perfect for beach days.
   - **Adventure**: You could explore the nearby Huatulco National Park, where lush jungle trails lead to waterfalls and swimming spots. A boat trip to see dolphins or even a scuba dive around the coral reefs can add a thrill.
   - **Culture and Nature**: Visit La Crucecita, a small town in Huatulco, to experience local markets, taste mezcal, and enjoy the warm hospitality of Oaxacan locals. There are also coffee plantation tours in the nearby mountains.
   
#### 2. **Lake Atitlán, Guatemala**
   - **Why it’s perfect**: Lake Atitlán is a stunning volcanic lake surrounded by Mayan villages, offering a blend of culture, nature, and relaxation.
   - **Beaches**: While not a traditional beach, the lakeshore has sandy spots ideal for lounging, with a backdrop of volcanic peaks and azure waters.
   - **Adventure**: You could kayak on the lake, hike up the San Pedro Volcano, or take a cultural tour of the indigenous villages. The family can learn about Mayan culture, try weaving, or shop for traditional crafts.
   - **Culture and City Fun**: The lakeside towns, especially Panajachel, are full of colorful markets, cozy cafés, and local restaurants. You could even visit the bustling town of Antigua (a short trip away) for some time in a historic city with cobblestone streets and old Spanish colonial charm.

#### 3. **Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica**
   - **Why it’s perfect**: This region of Costa Rica is known for its beaches, rainforests, and eco-tourism, and it's less crowded than the tourist-heavy areas.
   - **Beaches**: Tamarindo or Santa Teresa have lovely, relatively uncrowded beaches where you can relax, swim, or try surfing.
   - **Adventure**: Nicoya offers a blend of marine life encounters and land adventures. Try snorkeling or diving in the crystal-clear waters, take a canopy tour through the jungle, or explore the Curu Wildlife Refuge to spot capuchin monkeys and exotic birds.
   - **Local Vibes**: Towns like Montezuma offer an off-the-beaten-path vibe with art galleries, street vendors, and local cuisine. 

### Now, Just for Fun: A Trip to Vietnam!

Vietnam is a feast for the senses with a delightful mix of history, culture, natural wonders, and exciting cities. Here’s how your adventure in Vietnam could unfold:

- **Hanoi**: Begin in the bustling capital, Hanoi, where ancient temples like the Temple of Literature sit beside French colonial architecture. Wander through the Old Quarter, try authentic street food like pho and banh mi, and watch a traditional water puppet show.

- **Halong Bay**: From Hanoi, head to Halong Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its emerald waters and towering limestone islands. You can take a boat cruise through the bay, explore hidden caves, or kayak through scenic lagoons.

- **Hoi An**: Moving down the coast, Hoi An is a charming ancient town with lantern-lit streets, riverside markets, and a lively atmosphere. This town is famous for custom-tailored clothing, delightful local dishes like cao lau, and nearby beaches for a relaxing day by the sea.

- **Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)**: For a taste of city life, end your trip in Ho Chi Minh City. The city offers a look into Vietnam's modern vibrancy alongside its history, with sites like the War Remnants Museum and the Mekong Delta nearby. Explore the Cu Chi Tunnels or take a river cruise to see the lush greenery and floating markets.

Each of these destinations promises a unique experience, from tranquil beach days and vibrant local encounters to adrenaline-filled jungle explorations. Let me know if you’d like any additional details on any specific activity or planning assistance! 🌎

Flying internationally from Baltimore gives you a few good options for departure airports, each with its pros and cons, especially when considering New York as an alternative.

### 1. **Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)** – Your Closest Option
   - **Pros**: BWI is close to home and has a few direct international flights to Asia, though you might still need a layover for Vietnam. It’s convenient and easy to navigate, plus you save on travel time and any additional costs for getting to the airport.
   - **Cons**: Limited direct flight options to Asia, which may increase the layover times.

   **Typical Flights**: You may find options with one stop through cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, or even via East Coast hubs (like JFK or Dulles).

### 2. **Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington, D.C.** – Nearby Option with More International Flights
   - **Pros**: IAD is just about an hour from Baltimore and often has a wider selection of international flights, including options on airlines like ANA, Korean Air, and Emirates, which offer smoother connections to Vietnam through Asian hubs.
   - **Cons**: Slightly farther than BWI, and Dulles can be busy, which means you might need to arrive a bit earlier to navigate check-in and security.

   **Typical Flights**: With IAD, you might find better one-stop options, typically through Tokyo, Seoul, or other Asian hubs.

### 3. **John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York** – Best for Flight Variety and Deals
   - **Pros**: JFK is the largest airport for international flights in your vicinity, meaning it often has the best flight deals and a range of airlines heading to Asia (like Vietnam Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and Singapore Airlines). JFK could also give you more options for nonstop flights to major Asian hubs, which then connect to Vietnam.
   - **Cons**: It's a drive from Baltimore (about 3.5–4 hours), so you’d need to factor in the drive or parking costs if you leave your car.

   **Typical Flights**: From JFK, you could find one-stop flights through Tokyo, Seoul, or Taipei, as well as sometimes more affordable fares due to competition among airlines.

### **Recommendation**
- **Best for Convenience**: BWI is the easiest if you prefer the most straightforward journey, but you may need a layover and slightly longer travel time.
- **Best for Options and Potential Deals**: JFK will likely offer the most flights, competitive pricing, and smooth one-stop itineraries, though it does require the drive or additional transportation to get there.
- **Balanced Choice**: IAD offers a middle ground, with a decent selection of flights and a reasonable distance from Baltimore.
