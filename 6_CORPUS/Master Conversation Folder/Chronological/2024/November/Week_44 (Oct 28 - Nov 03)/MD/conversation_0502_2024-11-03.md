If you’ve forgotten which email you used for your TikTok account, you can try these methods to help you recover it:

### 1. **Try Logging In with Your Phone Number**
   - If you linked a phone number to your TikTok account, you can use it to log in directly:
   - **Open TikTok** > **Profile Icon** > **Log In** > **Use Phone/Email/Username** > **Phone Number**.
   - TikTok will send you a code to verify. Once logged in, you can check the email linked to your account in the settings.

### 2. **Search Your Email Accounts**
   - If you have multiple email addresses, search for past TikTok emails. Look for keywords like "TikTok" or "Welcome to TikTok" to identify which email you used for sign-up.

### 3. **Use Social Media Login**
   - If you linked TikTok to another platform like Google, Facebook, or Twitter, try logging in with that platform. Once logged in, go to **Profile** > **Settings** > **Account Information** to see which email is associated.

### 4. **Check Your Password Manager**
   - If you use a password manager (like LastPass or iCloud Keychain), check there for your TikTok login information. It might list the email used along with your saved password.

### 5. **Contact TikTok Support**
   - If none of the above work, reach out to TikTok support for help:
     - Visit [TikTok’s Feedback Form](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback).
     - Describe your issue and include as much detail as you can about your account (username, phone number, approximate creation date).
     - TikTok support can help identify your account and guide you through the recovery steps.

Following one of these should get you back into your account!
