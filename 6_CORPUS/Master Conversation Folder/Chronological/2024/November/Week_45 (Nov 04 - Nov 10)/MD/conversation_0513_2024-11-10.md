Please provide a bible quote that would convince someone to buy solar panels. Preferably New Testament Jesus quote

While the New Testament doesn't specifically mention solar panels, Jesus' teachings emphasize stewardship and care for God's creation. For instance, in the Parable of the Talents, Jesus illustrates the importance of responsibly managing the resources entrusted to us:

*"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'"* citeturn0search1

This parable underscores the value of wisely utilizing and preserving the resources we have. Investing in solar panels aligns with this principle by harnessing renewable energy, reducing environmental impact, and demonstrating responsible stewardship of the earth's resources.
