create a theme song for a childrens show called "Camp Funshine".  The Tagline for Camp Funshine is "Where you just show up!".  Please write lyrics about a fun camp for senior citizens where they have all kinds of fun activities.  The activities are naps, field trips to Talbots, Baltimore Tea and Coffee, and Geppi Nuts.  Another activity is for Russ to arrange the furniture to make his special reading corner, Carol watching TV very loudly, and reading books before you fall asleep and Russ washing dishes.   Talk about how Mark, Sheila, Caroline and Cookie are all looking forward to seeing them.  Write the bridge about Sister Boney Face.  Sister Boney Face waits all year for the campers to arrive so she can scare them.  She scare them in the shower, in their rooms, and in the kitchen.   Make the chorus talk about how much fun camp sunshine is and the tagline is "Where you just show up!"

**[Intro]**  
Camp Funshine’s here, come one, come all!  
For naps, for fun, big laughs, big halls!  

**[Verse 1]**  
We’re off to Talbots for a shopping spree,  
Baltimore Tea and Coffee for a cup (or three)!  
Geppi Nuts for snacks that crunch,  
Then back to camp for a lazy lunch!  

Russ is setting up his cozy reading zone,  
While Carol’s TV blares a friendly tone!  
Books are stacked, naps await,  
Camp Funshine – it's never too late!

**[Chorus]**  
Camp Funshine! Where you just show up!  
A place for laughs, for naps, for cups raised up!  
Mark, Sheila, Caroline, and Cookie too,  
They’re all here, waiting just for you!

**[Verse 2]**  
Reading till you drift to sleep,  
Russ in the kitchen, dishes to keep.  
Every day’s a little treat,  
With friends so warm and laughter sweet!

**[Chorus]**  
Camp Funshine! Where you just show up!  
From morning tea to a nap-filled cup!  
Mark, Sheila, Caroline, and Cookie too,  
They can’t wait to hang with you!

**[Bridge]**  
Then there’s Sister Boney Face, lurking in the night,  
Waiting all year to give campers a fright!  
In the showers, rooms, and the kitchen too,  
A “BOO!” here, a “YIKES!” just for you!

**[Chorus]**  
Camp Funshine! Where you just show up!  
It’s naps and friends and fun non-stop!  
With hugs, good food, and tea on tap,  
Camp Funshine – your perfect nap map!  

**[Outro]**  
So pack your bags, the fun’s begun,  
Camp Funshine – welcome, everyone!
