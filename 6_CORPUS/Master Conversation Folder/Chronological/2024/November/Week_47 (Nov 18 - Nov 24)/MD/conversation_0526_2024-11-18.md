To determine if a product qualifies for a domestic content adder under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), it needs to meet specific criteria for domestic manufacturing of components or materials. Based on the ClearVue Solar Facade brochure, here are key points to consider:

1. **Component Manufacturing Location**: The brochure does not explicitly mention where the individual components (e.g., glass, PVB layers, silicon solar cells, or junction boxes) are manufactured. For domestic content qualification, components like the solar cells and other significant materials must be sourced or manufactured in the U.S.

2. **Assembly**: It is unclear if the assembly of the product takes place in the U.S., which is another requirement for domestic content eligibility.

3. **Certifications**: The product includes international certifications and compliance, but there’s no indication of specific alignment with U.S. domestic content requirements under the IRA.

4. **Potential for Qualification**: If ClearVue has a manufacturing presence or partnerships in the U.S. for its key components, the product might qualify. Additional documentation from ClearVue or its suppliers would be required to verify compliance.

You may need to contact ClearVue directly or obtain detailed manufacturing and sourcing documentation to confirm eligibility for the domestic content adder.
