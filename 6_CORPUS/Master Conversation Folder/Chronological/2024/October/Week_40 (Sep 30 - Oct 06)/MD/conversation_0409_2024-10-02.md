A "self-assigned IP" on your Mac Mini means that the system has not successfully obtained an IP address from your router through the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). When this happens, the Mac assigns itself an IP address, but it cannot communicate with the internet or other devices on the network.

Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check Ethernet Connection:**
   - Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely plugged into both the Mac Mini and the router.
   - Try using a different Ethernet cable or a different port on the router if available to rule out a hardware issue.

### 2. **Renew DHCP Lease:**
   - Go to **System Settings** on your Mac Mini.
   - Click on **Network** and select **Ethernet** in the list on the left.
   - Click on **Details** next to Ethernet, then go to the **TCP/IP** tab.
   - Click on **Renew DHCP Lease**. This will ask the router to assign a new IP address to your Mac Mini.

### 3. **Set Ethernet as Primary:**
   - Under **System Settings > Network**, drag **Ethernet** to the top of the list on the left (above Wi-Fi) to make it the primary connection.

### 4. **Restart Devices:**
   - Restart both your Mac Mini and your router to reset the connection and allow the router to assign the proper IP address.

### 5. **Check Router Settings:**
   - Log into your router (usually by typing its IP address into a browser, typically something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).
   - Ensure that the router's DHCP settings are enabled and there are enough IP addresses available in the pool to assign to your Mac Mini.

If the issue persists after following these steps, let me know, and we can explore further troubleshooting options.
