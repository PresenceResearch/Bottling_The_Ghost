In the context of National Park Service (NPS) reservations, a "transferred reservation" typically refers to situations where a reservation can be modified or transferred to a different set of dates or campsites within the same facility, rather than being canceled outright. However, there are restrictions; such modifications must be done before the cut-off window, and there are sometimes change fees associated with it. Additionally, many NPS reservations are not transferable to other individuals, meaning the person who made the reservation must be the one to use it【6†source】【9†source】.

If you need to adjust the reservation, it is often handled through the Recreation.gov platform, where users can modify dates or locations, but these changes depend on availability and specific rules of the park.

In the context of real estate, particularly involving National Park Service (NPS) properties or federally controlled lands, a "transferred reservation" generally refers to the legal transfer of the use or ownership rights of a specific parcel of land from one entity to another. This often occurs under programs such as the Federal Lands to Parks (FLP) program, where the NPS may transfer surplus federal real estate to local governments or other agencies for public use, typically as parks or recreational areas.

The transfer often includes restrictions or covenants that ensure the land is used for its intended public purpose in perpetuity. This can involve specific legal agreements to preserve the land's conservation or historic value. Such transferred reservations are not sold but transferred under strict conditions that bind the new owners to continue using the land for the public benefit【6†source】【8†source】.
