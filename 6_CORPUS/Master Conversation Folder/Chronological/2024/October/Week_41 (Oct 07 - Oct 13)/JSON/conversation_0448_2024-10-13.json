She has a lot of experiences in founding and closing companies and working at her family\u2019s real estate business, The Tower Cos., founded by grandfather Albert Abramson and the builder of Washington Square and White Flint Mall. \n\n[Image 4: marnie abramson lights][Image 5: marnie abramson lights]BRINGING IN THE LIGHT: Marnie Abramson started her career in a family-owned real-estate company providing green, ecologically friendly solutions. In her new company, NextGen, she is focusing on efficient ways of lighting up our living rooms and offices.\n\nShe admits that, as perhaps for any leader in a growing business, her main challenge in life is finding the right balance. \u201cWhen you start a new business, it\u2019s literally all about the job,\u201d Marnie explained to Washington Business Journal. \u201cI went from working for my family in a very established real estate company for 10 years to starting my own business. And it is literally like turning your whole world upside down on its ear! It\u2019s disorienting but it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nBut it that is nothing new to the successful CEO.\n\n## Work smarter not harder!\n\n\u201cMy work environment has always been very hectic, with millions of things that were always going on at any given time. In the past, I found I\u00a0could get very caught up in that madness. If you have twenty things going on in your head and there\u2019s no way to organize that, it feels very frenetic, and I spent a lot of energy for a very little bit of output\u2026\u201d Marnie Abramson says.\n\nHer secret for keeping her cool amidst all this turbulence?

In her new company, NextGen, she is focusing on efficient ways of lighting up our living rooms and offices.\n\nShe admits that, as perhaps for any leader in a growing business, her main challenge in life is finding the right balance. \u201cWhen you start a new business, it\u2019s literally all about the job,\u201d Marnie explained to Washington Business Journal. \u201cI went from working for my family in a very established real estate company for 10 years to starting my own business. And it is literally like turning your whole world upside down on its ear! It\u2019s disorienting but it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nBut it that is nothing new to the successful CEO.\n\n## Work smarter not harder!\n\n\u201cMy work environment has always been very hectic, with millions of things that were always going on at any given time. In the past, I found I\u00a0could get very caught up in that madness. If you have twenty things going on in your head and there\u2019s no way to organize that, it feels very frenetic, and I spent a lot of energy for a very little bit of output\u2026\u201d Marnie Abramson says.\n\nHer secret for keeping her cool amidst all this turbulence?

In the past, I found I\u00a0could get very caught up in that madness. If you have twenty things going on in your head and there\u2019s no way to organize that, it feels very frenetic, and I spent a lot of energy for a very little bit of output.\n\nThere were many people within the Tower Companies who had been doing the TM technique for a long time and were very positive about their experiences, so I decided to try it.\n\nWhat I really needed\u00a0was a way\u00a0to\u00a0come back into myself, quiet my mind a little bit so that I could focus. TM practice settles me down and helps me be more organized. There\u2019s a famous business phrase \u2018Work smarter not harder.\u2019 I think that is really what the Transcendental Meditation program has done for me.\n\nI would say that arranging a TM course for your employees is probably the fastest, easiest, and least expensive way of getting more out of your workers than you could ever imagine.\n\n#### Biography \n\nMarnie Abramson is the President of Green Lumens Mid-Atlantic, LLC. Previously she was a principal of The Tower Companies, the largest green real estate developer in the Washington DC area. In 2008, Ms. Abramson received the prestigious Women Who Mean Business award from the Washington Business Journal and was named one of the 35 most influential people under 35 by the DC publication Bisnow Real Estate. With a background in investment banking, a BA in communications, and an MBA in finance, Ms. Abramson focuses specifically on the costs and benefits of green buildings. She is an active public speaker, educating businesses, brokers, government groups, and others about eco-progressive real estate. She participates in local, national, and international expert panels, and has provided public testimony for green building legislation in Maryland and the District of Columbia.\n\n[Image 15][Image 16]\n\n###### Martha Batorski \n\n# Martha Batorski \n\n#### Statement \n\nI learned to meditate at age 17. From the first day, I noticed tangible benefits\u2014greater inner silence, calmness, focus, improved clarity and intuition, broader comprehension. Today I enjoy these same values to an even greater extent while balancing family life with running a growing management consulting practice, teaching at a university, executive coaching, and public speaking. In 2012 I completed doctoral research on leadership resilience, exploring the development of cognitive capacity in leaders to improve executive judgment and decision making under stress. My study explored the impact of the TM technique on situation awareness capacity of emerging leaders at Norwich University in Vermont. The study showed that those who practiced the TM technique had statistically significant improvement. These findings are being applied in the development of resilience programs that incorporate the use of the TM program to improve situation awareness capacity in professionals (nurses, doctors, emergency medical responders, law enforcement, military) who are operating in high demand settings. Adding the TM practice twice a day to my daily routine continues to result in greater resilience to stress and more inner and outer fulfillment.\n\n#### Biography \n\nMartha Batorski, EdD, a former Associate Partner with Accenture\u2019s Business Architecture practice, is currently CEO of Batorski Stevens & Associates, Inc., a nationally recognized management consulting firm launched in 2003. In 2004 her firm was the winner of the Emerging Business of the Year Award from the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO). She has helped over 15 Fortune 1000 companies with large-scale, enterprise-wide improvement initiatives resulting in high performance. She has consulted for 25 years across multiple industry sectors including government, electronics and high tech, healthcare, utilities, entertainment, retail, and financial services. Inspired by her experience with the Transcendental Meditation program, she completed a doctorate in Organization Change at Pepperdine University, focusing on the role of development of consciousness (situation awareness capacity) in executive decision making under uncertainty and stress. Dr. Batorski serves as Adjunct Faculty in the MBA program at Roseman University of Health Sciences, Las Vegas, NV. She is also a keynote speaker in the areas of executive judgment and decision making under stress and women in leadership.\n\n### Doctors\n\n[Image 17][Image 18]\n\n###### Dr. Lourdes Garcia Mollinedo \n\n# Dr. Lourdes Garcia Mollinedo \n\n#### Statement \n\nTM restores cellular physiology, awakens the main organizers of the body and ensures order and correct functioning of cells.  \nThe practical implication of this mechanism is to lower arterial pressure, reduce glucose and lipid levels, decrease cardiovascular risks and death from cardiovascular problems.  \nTM is a cost-effective and cost-saving health intervention with positive economic impact for the individual, for society and for healthcare systems\n\n#### Biography \n\nDr. Lourdes Garcia Mollinedo graduated as a cardiologist from the Cardiology Hospital of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI in Mexico City.

Her company, NextGen Partners -- which advises companies on energy-saving lighting -- has grown into a $10 million business and is poised for further growth.\u00a0\n\nIn this interview with EIX's Dave Feldman, Abramson talks about how her experiences in her family's real estate company helped shape her current venture; why the failure of her first business led to new beginnings and increased confidence; the impact of her mentors, including her grandfather; and why she's the worst person to invite to a party.\n\n## Read More:\n\n\u301028\u2020Advice, Best Practices and Inspiration for Women Entrepreneurs\u3011\n\nAdditional search terms: women, female founders, women business owners, sustainability, sales, going green, environment, global warming, sustainable, climate change, environmental, sustainable business, reversing climate change, sustainable buildings, energy efficiency\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 3: Dave Feldman] \n\n\u301017\u2020Dave Feldman\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011   \nCEO / Livability Project   \n\u301017\u2020View Profile\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011\n\n* * *\n\nPublication Endorsement Editors\n\n[Image 4: James C Wetherbe] \n\n\u301029\u2020James C Wetherbe\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011\n\n\u301030\u2020David Deeds\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011\n\n* * *\n\nCite this Article\n\nDOI: 10.17919/X9GW2J\n\n  * APA\n  * MLA\n\nFeldman, Dave. \"Marnie Abramson: Caring for the Bottom Line and the Planet.\" FamilyBusiness.org. 10 May. 2016.

She has a lot of experiences in founding and closing companies and working at her family\u2019s real estate business, The Tower Cos., founded by grandfather Albert Abramson and the builder of Washington Square and White Flint Mall. \n\n[Image 4: marnie abramson lights][Image 5: marnie abramson lights]BRINGING IN THE LIGHT: Marnie Abramson started her career in a family-owned real-estate company providing green, ecologically friendly solutions. In her new company, NextGen, she is focusing on efficient ways of lighting up our living rooms and offices.\n\nShe admits that, as perhaps for any leader in a growing business, her main challenge in life is finding the right balance. \u201cWhen you start a new business, it\u2019s literally all about the job,\u201d Marnie explained to Washington Business Journal. \u201cI went from working for my family in a very established real estate company for 10 years to starting my own business. And it is literally like turning your whole world upside down on its ear! It\u2019s disorienting but it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nBut it that is nothing new to the successful CEO.\n\n## Work smarter not harder!\n\n\u201cMy work environment has always been very hectic, with millions of things that were always going on at any given time. In the past, I found I\u00a0could get very caught up in that madness. If you have twenty things going on in your head and there\u2019s no way to organize that, it feels very frenetic, and I spent a lot of energy for a very little bit of output\u2026\u201d Marnie Abramson says.\n\nHer secret for keeping her cool amidst all this turbulence? The Transcendental Meditation technique.\n\n\u301011\u2020***CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT HOW MEDITATION CAN TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE***\u2020www.tm.org\u3011\n\n\u201cWhat I really needed was a way to come back into myself, quiet my mind a little bit so that I could focus. TM practice settles me down and helps me be more organized. There\u2019s a famous business phrase \u2018Work smarter not harder.\u2019 I think that is really what the\u00a0\u301012\u2020Transcendental Meditation\u3011 program has done for me.\u201d\n\nSources:  \nTMwomenProfessionals.org  \n\u301013\u2020Washington Business Journal\u2020www.bizjournals.com\u3011\n\n\u301011\u2020***CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT HOW MEDITATION CAN TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE***\u2020www.tm.org\u3011\n\n[Image 6: Ad image][Image 7: Ad image]\n\n\u301014\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301014\u2020Todd Casterline, Military Vet: How Meditation changed my life\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \u30102\u2020People\u3011 \n\n\u301015\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301015\u2020TM Meditation: Finding inner peace and happiness\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \n\n\u301016\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301016\u2020The Transformative Benefits of Transcendental Meditation for ADHD\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \n\n\u301017\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301017\u2020Transformative Impact of Transcendental Meditation on Nurse Well-being: A Groundbreaking Study\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \n\nTAGGED: \u301018\u2020CEOs who meditate\u3011, \u301019\u2020work efficiency\u3011\n\nShare This Article\n\n\u301020\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \u30108\u2020 Twitter\u2020twitter.com\u3011 Copy Link Print\n\nShare\n\n\u30108\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n\n\u301021\u2020 Previous Article Katy Perry: \u201ctranscendental meditation changed my life\u201d \u3011 \n\n\u301022\u2020 Next Article Study in veterans with PTSD \u3011 \n\n#### Search\n\nSearch for:\n\n[Image 8: Ad image][Image 9: Ad image]\n\n#### Latest News\n\n\u301014\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301014\u2020Todd Casterline, Military Vet: How Meditation changed my life\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \u30102\u2020People\u3011  March 7, 2024\n\n\u301015\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301015\u2020TM Meditation: Finding inner peace and happiness\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  March 6, 2024\n\n\u301016\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301016\u2020The Transformative Benefits of Transcendental Meditation for ADHD\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  February 17, 2024\n\n\u301017\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301017\u2020Transformative Impact of Transcendental Meditation on Nurse Well-being: A Groundbreaking Study\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  December 15, 2023\n\n\u301023\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301023\u2020Unlocking Tranquil Nights through Transcendental Meditation\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  October 7, 2023\n\n\u301024\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301024\u2020How meditation may save you from harmful levels of stress\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  May 31, 2023\n\n\u301025\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301025\u2020Transcendental Meditation for Anxiety: Find Inner Calm\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \u30102\u2020People\u3011  May 28, 2023\n\n#### Stay Connected\n\n686k Followers Like\n\n85k Followers Follow\n\n2k Followers Pin\n\n155k Followers Follow\n\n127k Subscribers Subscribe\n\n####",

In fact, her partners were asked, \"Why are you partnering with a green girl?\"\u00a0 But Abramson today is a leading expert on how companies can take care of both the planet and the bottom line, and skilled at demonstrating the financial benefits from doing the right thing. Her company, NextGen Partners -- which advises companies on energy-saving lighting -- has grown into a $10 million business and is poised for further growth.\u00a0\n\nIn this interview with EIX's Dave Feldman, Abramson talks about how her experiences in her family's real estate company helped shape her current venture; why the failure of her first business led to new beginnings and increased confidence; the impact of her mentors, including her grandfather; and why she's the worst person to invite to a party.\n\n## Read More:\n\n\u301028\u2020Advice, Best Practices and Inspiration for Women Entrepreneurs\u3011\n\nAdditional search terms: women, female founders, women business owners, sustainability, sales, going green, environment, global warming, sustainable, climate change, environmental, sustainable business, reversing climate change, sustainable buildings, energy efficiency\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 3: Dave Feldman] \n\n\u301017\u2020Dave Feldman\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011   \nCEO / Livability Project   \n\u301017\u2020View Profile\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011\n\n* * *\n\nPublication Endorsement Editors\n\n[Image 4: James C Wetherbe] \n\n\u301029\u2020James C Wetherbe\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011\n\n\u301030\u2020David Deeds\u2020eiexchange.com\u3011\n\n* * *\n\nCite this Article\n\nDOI: 10.17919/X9GW2J\n\n  * APA\n  * MLA\n\nFeldman, Dave. \"Marnie Abramson: Caring for the Bottom Line and the Planet.\" FamilyBusiness.org. 10 May. 2016.

She has a lot of experiences in founding and closing companies and working at her family\u2019s real estate business, The Tower Cos., founded by grandfather Albert Abramson and the builder of Washington Square and White Flint Mall. \n\n[Image 4: marnie abramson lights][Image 5: marnie abramson lights]BRINGING IN THE LIGHT: Marnie Abramson started her career in a family-owned real-estate company providing green, ecologically friendly solutions. In her new company, NextGen, she is focusing on efficient ways of lighting up our living rooms and offices.\n\nShe admits that, as perhaps for any leader in a growing business, her main challenge in life is finding the right balance. \u201cWhen you start a new business, it\u2019s literally all about the job,\u201d Marnie explained to Washington Business Journal. \u201cI went from working for my family in a very established real estate company for 10 years to starting my own business. And it is literally like turning your whole world upside down on its ear! It\u2019s disorienting but it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nBut it that is nothing new to the successful CEO.\n\n## Work smarter not harder!\n\n\u201cMy work environment has always been very hectic, with millions of things that were always going on at any given time. In the past, I found I\u00a0could get very caught up in that madness. If you have twenty things going on in your head and there\u2019s no way to organize that, it feels very frenetic, and I spent a lot of energy for a very little bit of output\u2026\u201d Marnie Abramson says.\n\nHer secret for keeping her cool amidst all this turbulence? The Transcendental Meditation technique.\n\n\u301011\u2020***CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT HOW MEDITATION CAN TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE***\u2020www.tm.org\u3011\n\n\u201cWhat I really needed was a way to come back into myself, quiet my mind a little bit so that I could focus. TM practice settles me down and helps me be more organized. There\u2019s a famous business phrase \u2018Work smarter not harder.\u2019 I think that is really what the\u00a0\u301012\u2020Transcendental Meditation\u3011 program has done for me.\u201d\n\nSources:  \nTMwomenProfessionals.org  \n\u301013\u2020Washington Business Journal\u2020www.bizjournals.com\u3011\n\n\u301011\u2020***CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT HOW MEDITATION CAN TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE***\u2020www.tm.org\u3011\n\n[Image 6: Ad image][Image 7: Ad image]\n\n\u301014\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301014\u2020Todd Casterline, Military Vet: How Meditation changed my life\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \u30102\u2020People\u3011 \n\n\u301015\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301015\u2020TM Meditation: Finding inner peace and happiness\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \n\n\u301016\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301016\u2020The Transformative Benefits of Transcendental Meditation for ADHD\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \n\n\u301017\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301017\u2020Transformative Impact of Transcendental Meditation on Nurse Well-being: A Groundbreaking Study\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \n\nTAGGED: \u301018\u2020CEOs who meditate\u3011, \u301019\u2020work efficiency\u3011\n\nShare This Article\n\n\u301020\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \u30108\u2020 Twitter\u2020twitter.com\u3011 Copy Link Print\n\nShare\n\n\u30108\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n\n\u301021\u2020 Previous Article Katy Perry: \u201ctranscendental meditation changed my life\u201d \u3011 \n\n\u301022\u2020 Next Article Study in veterans with PTSD \u3011 \n\n#### Search\n\nSearch for:\n\n[Image 8: Ad image][Image 9: Ad image]\n\n#### Latest News\n\n\u301014\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301014\u2020Todd Casterline, Military Vet: How Meditation changed my life\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \u30102\u2020People\u3011  March 7, 2024\n\n\u301015\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301015\u2020TM Meditation: Finding inner peace and happiness\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  March 6, 2024\n\n\u301016\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301016\u2020The Transformative Benefits of Transcendental Meditation for ADHD\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  February 17, 2024\n\n\u301017\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301017\u2020Transformative Impact of Transcendental Meditation on Nurse Well-being: A Groundbreaking Study\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  December 15, 2023\n\n\u301023\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301023\u2020Unlocking Tranquil Nights through Transcendental Meditation\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  October 7, 2023\n\n\u301024\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301024\u2020How meditation may save you from harmful levels of stress\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011  May 31, 2023\n\n\u301025\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301025\u2020Transcendental Meditation for Anxiety: Find Inner Calm\u3011\n\n\u30101\u2020Benefits\u3011 \u30102\u2020People\u3011  May 28, 2023\n\n#### Stay Connected\n\n686k Followers Like\n\n85k Followers Follow\n\n2k Followers Pin\n\n155k Followers Follow\n\n127k Subscribers Subscribe\n\n####"
