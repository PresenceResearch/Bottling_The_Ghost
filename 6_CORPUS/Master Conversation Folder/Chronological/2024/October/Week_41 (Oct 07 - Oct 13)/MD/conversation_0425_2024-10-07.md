### "Shelagh and the Spooky Grooves"  
*(Performed by The Haunted Harmony)*

**[Verse 1]**  
In a town where the moon shines low,  
There’s a beat that makes the pumpkins glow.  
Shelagh the spider pumps her horn,  
Chillin' with her crew since the day she was born.  
Nelson’s got his banjo tight,  
Strumming in the dark of the spooky night.  
They’re the band that everybody knows,  
When the wind howls, and the graveyard grows!

**[Chorus]**  
They’re Shelagh and the Spooky Grooves,  
Bringing the beats that make you move.  
In Spooky Town, they’re number one,  
Playing ‘til the rising sun.  
So come on down, don’t be afraid,  
Dance with shadows in the shade.  
The Halloween party’s on tonight,  
With Shelagh’s horn and Nelson’s fright!

**[Verse 2]**  
At the party where the candles flick,  
Mark Manthy’s doing his ghostly trick.  
Cookie Veronica’s baking treats,  
Sugar spiders and pumpkin sweets.  
Jaba Julie’s got her witchy dance,  
Will and Akari share a midnight trance.  
Even Depeche Mode, dressed in black,  
Singin' along, with no lookin' back.

**[Chorus]**  
They’re Shelagh and the Spooky Grooves,  
Bringing the beats that make you move.  
In Spooky Town, they’re number one,  
Playing ‘til the rising sun.  
So come on down, don’t be afraid,  
Dance with shadows in the shade.  
The Halloween party’s on tonight,  
With Shelagh’s horn and Nelson’s fright!

**[Bridge]**  
The Clan of Xymox joins the fun,  
With eerie sounds and haunting hums.  
Ghostly fog rolls on the ground,  
As skeletons waltz all around.  
In Spooky Town, the spirits rise,  
Under the dark October skies.

**[Chorus]**  
They’re Shelagh and the Spooky Grooves,  
Bringing the beats that make you move.  
In Spooky Town, they’re number one,  
Playing ‘til the rising sun.  
So come on down, don’t be afraid,  
Dance with shadows in the shade.  
The Halloween party’s on tonight,  
With Shelagh’s horn and Nelson’s fright!

**[Outro]**  
So if you’re brave and want to see,  
A Halloween night filled with glee,  
Come to Spooky Town and hear the sound,  
Of Shelagh’s pump and Nelson’s profound.  
The Haunted Harmony’s here to play,  
At every eerie, spooky soiree!
