On Halloween night, beneath the moon's glow,  
A spooky crew gathers, ready for the show.  
Bumpy the Pumpkin, with a smile so wide,  
Sings all the songs with a voice full of pride.  

Chili Nelson, with his banjo in hand,  
Strums out the beats for this monster band.  
Shelagh the Spider, her eight legs in flight,  
Plays her horn loud, filling the night.  

Mark Monster roars, while Akari does howl,  
Together they dance with a mischievous scowl.  
Deva Cookie Grace, in her eerie delight,  
Sways to the rhythm in the pale moonlight.  

Mean Jean arrives, as fierce as they come,  
Flocka the Skeleton taps on the drum.  
The music is wild, the party's alive,  
Every Halloween night, the spirits revive.  

Cookie Veronica Howells, with a grin so sweet,  
Joins in the fun, making this party complete.  
They laugh, they play, ‘til the dawn breaks the sky,  
Then they all disappear, waving goodbye.  

But next Halloween, when the moon’s shining bright,  
This spooky band returns for another wild night!
