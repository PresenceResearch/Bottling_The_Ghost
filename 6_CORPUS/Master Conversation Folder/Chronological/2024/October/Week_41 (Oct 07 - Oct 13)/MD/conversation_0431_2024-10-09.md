Welcome to the Show  

[Intro][Upbeat Music]  
Lights are shining, curtains rising, it's time for the show  
The crowd's buzzing, anticipation, excitement starts to grow  
[Verse][Broadway]  
We've got a story to tell, so hold on tight  
A night of laughter, dreams, and songs that shine so bright  
[Chorus][Cheering]  
Welcome to the show, the magic starts tonight  
Step into a world where everything feels right  
With a smile, a song, and a dance or two  
This Broadway stage is calling out to you  
[Verse][Upbeat]  
The city's alive with rhythm and rhyme  
You'll be singing along, losing track of time  
Every character, every scene, takes you higher  
Set your soul on fire  
[Chorus][Cheering][Applause]  
Welcome to the show, let the lights burn bright  
A dazzling adventure, it’s pure delight  
With a song in your heart, and a dream in view  
Broadway's lights are shining just for you  
[Outro][Clapping][Upbeat Music]  
So take a bow, you've made it here, let the music soar  
Welcome to the show, now and evermore  
>  

This lively Broadway-style opener sets the stage with an energetic, celebratory tone perfect for kicking off a musical with excitement and applause.
