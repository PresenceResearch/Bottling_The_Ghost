To find detailed information about the DC Renewable Energy Credit (REC) program, you can visit the official page from the DC Public Service Commission (DCPSC). This site provides annual reports on the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and tracks the status of RECs within the District. You can access the reports and other details about how the program operates, including how RECs are retired to meet regulatory requirements.

Here is the link to the DCPSC's 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) Report and related resources:

statement of qualifications for DC SRECs

**Assistant:**

The qualifications for DC Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) are based on the **District’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**. The RPS requires electricity suppliers to generate a portion of their energy from renewable sources like solar, and SRECs are created for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated by a solar energy system. To qualify for DC SRECs, the following conditions generally apply:

1. **Location**: The solar energy system must be located within the District of Columbia, or in some cases, within a specific geographical area like the PJM Interconnection region (which includes nearby states) to qualify for SRECs.

2. **Certification**: The solar system must be certified by the **DC Public Service Commission (DCPSC)**. This involves submitting an application to the DCPSC that includes system details, such as size, energy production capacity, and other technical specifics.

3. **Metering**: The system must have metering equipment capable of tracking electricity generation in real-time. This ensures accurate accounting for the SRECs.

4. **System Size**: There is no minimum size requirement, meaning systems from small residential rooftop panels to large commercial installations can qualify, though the amount of SRECs generated will depend on the size and energy output.

5. **Compliance**: The owner must maintain compliance with ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to keep generating SRECs.

Once these requirements are met, system owners can sell SRECs to utility companies that need to meet their RPS solar carve-out obligations, creating a financial incentive for generating solar energy.

For more detailed guidelines, you can consult the **DCPSC's official resources** on SRECs [here](https://dcpsc.org/Orders-and-Regulations/PSC-Reports-to-DC-Council/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard.aspx)【6†source】【8†source】.

Given that your commercial solar sales cycles are lengthy (6+ months) and financing is a critical factor, it’s essential to track both activity-based and outcome-based metrics to maintain momentum and accountability. Here are some effective accountability metrics tailored to your sales team's unique process:

### 1. **Pipeline Stage Progression**:
   - **Lead Qualification Rate**: Track the percentage of leads that move from initial outreach to qualification. This ensures reps are targeting viable prospects and pushing deals through the early stages.
   - **Opportunity Progression Time**: Measure how long opportunities stay in each stage of the pipeline. Identify bottlenecks and ensure deals move steadily toward closing.
   
### 2. **Activity-Based Metrics**:
   - **Outreach and Follow-Up Activity**: Set weekly targets for outreach (calls, emails, and meetings) to ensure consistent communication, especially given long sales cycles. This can include check-ins related to project status and financing discussions.
   - **Financing Discussions**: Given the dependence on financing, track the number of conversations initiated about financing options, securing letters of intent, and lender interactions. This ensures financing issues are being addressed early in the sales process.

### 3. **Sales Funnel Management**:
   - **Qualified Opportunities Created**: Measure how many opportunities move from prospecting to being a qualified deal based on clear criteria, such as the identification of financing options and system requirements.
   - **Proposal Submissions**: Track how many proposals each rep is submitting monthly or quarterly. This will encourage reps to focus on advancing qualified leads to proposal stages.

### 4. **Time-Based Metrics**:
   - **Average Time in Key Stages**: Given the long cycle, track how long deals remain in key stages, such as design, financing negotiation, and contract redlining. This will highlight where delays are occurring and allow reps to proactively manage them.
   
### 5. **Closing Rate on Proposals**:
   - **Conversion Rate from Proposal to Close**: Measure the success rate of moving from submitted proposals to closed deals. Given the influence of financing, you can also track how financing-related proposals convert compared to those without financing discussions.

### 6. **Customer Interaction and Engagement**:
   - **Decision-Maker Meetings**: Track the number of meetings and communications with decision-makers, ensuring that reps are building relationships at the right level.
   - **Response Times**: Monitor how quickly reps respond to customer inquiries, especially when financing-related discussions arise. Quick responses can significantly affect deal progression.

### 7. **Financing-Specific Metrics**:
   - **Financing Approval Rate**: Track how many deals move forward based on successful financing, whether through third-party lenders, leasing, or power purchase agreements (PPA). This ensures that reps focus on securing feasible financing options early in the process.
   - **Average Financing Secured Time**: Given that financing is often a gating factor, measure how long it takes from initial contact with lenders to securing approval for the project.

### 8. **Quarterly Pipeline Health Check**:
   - Conduct quarterly reviews of the entire pipeline with a focus on financing status, system design readiness, and project feasibility. This keeps the team accountable for moving deals forward at a consistent pace.

Implementing these metrics will provide visibility into both the effort and results, ensuring that your team remains accountable while navigating long and complex sales cycles. Would you like assistance in setting up dashboards or a reporting system to track these metrics?
