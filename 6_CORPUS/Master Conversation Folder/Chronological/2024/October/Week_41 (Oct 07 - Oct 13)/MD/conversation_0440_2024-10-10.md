why are the lyrics that I paste into Udio gibberish? 

---

**Assistant:**

If the lyrics you paste into Udio are appearing as gibberish, it could be due to several reasons:

1. **Character Encoding Issue**: Udio might not be handling the encoding of special characters or non-ASCII characters properly. Lyrics in languages other than English or those containing accents or special symbols may display incorrectly if Udio doesn't support the necessary character encoding.

2. **Copy-Paste Formatting**: If you’re copying lyrics from a website or document with hidden formatting (like HTML or rich text), that formatting might not translate well when pasted into Udio, causing odd symbols or gibberish to appear.

3. **Software Bug**: There could be a bug in the app itself, causing pasted content to render improperly. In this case, it might be worth reporting the issue to Udio’s support team or checking if there is an update for the app.

To troubleshoot, you can try:
- Pasting the lyrics into a plain text editor (like Notepad) first to strip away any formatting before pasting them into Udio.
- Verifying that you’re copying from a source with simple, clean text.

what suno metatag should i use to slow down a phrase?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-10 11:04:26*

In Suno (which I assume refers to the text-to-speech platform or software you're using), to slow down a specific phrase, you typically use metatags that control the speech rate. Many TTS platforms have similar tags or syntax to adjust speed.

For Suno, you can try the following approach to slow down a phrase:

```text
<speak>
  This is a <prosody rate="slow"> slowed down phrase </prosody> in the middle of the sentence.
</speak>
```

- **`<prosody rate="slow">`**: This tag adjusts the speed of the speech. You can replace "slow" with specific values like "x-slow" for extra slow, or percentages like "75%" to fine-tune the speed.

Does this work for your needs? If not, I can help find more specific syntax if Suno uses different metatags.

how do you have the key change up a halfstep

---

**Assistant:**

To execute a key change up a half step in a music-related platform or software, the method largely depends on the tool you're using. Here's how you might approach it in different contexts:

### 1. **In DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations)**:
   If you're using a DAW like Ableton Live, FL Studio, or Logic Pro, you can raise the pitch by:
   
   - **MIDI Tracks**: 
     - Select the notes or passage you'd like to transpose.
     - Use the transpose feature (usually accessible by right-clicking or in the piano roll settings) to raise the pitch by one semitone (half-step).

   - **Audio Tracks**:
     - Many DAWs have a pitch shift or transpose function. Select the audio region and raise the pitch by +1 semitone.

### 2. **In Notation Software (Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore)**:
   - Highlight the section where you want to transpose the key.
   - Use the **Transpose** tool and select the option to move the notes up by 1 semitone (half-step).
   - You may also need to adjust the key signature if you want a formal key change for the remainder of the piece.

### 3. **In Audio Playback/Practice Apps (like Suno or others)**:
   If you're looking for pitch shift functionality during playback:
   - Many apps or platforms offer a "pitch shift" feature where you can increase or decrease the pitch by semitone increments. Look for a "transpose" or "pitch" control, and adjust it to +1 semitone to raise it a half-step.

### 4. **In TTS/Audio Platforms like Suno**:
   If you are referring to changing the pitch of a phrase in Suno's text-to-speech, some platforms may allow you to modify pitch with metatags. For example:

   ```text
   <prosody pitch="+1st"> This phrase is now raised by a half step. </prosody>
   ```

   The **`+1st`** adjusts the pitch up by one semitone (1st = half-step).

how do you make a word said by a crowd or sung by a chorus in suno

---

**Assistant:**

In **Suno** or similar text-to-speech platforms, achieving a "crowd" or "chorus" effect typically requires layering voices or manipulating the audio output to simulate multiple people speaking or singing in unison.

While Suno may not natively support multiple simultaneous voices, here are a few approaches you could try:

### 1. **Layering Multiple Voices** (Post-processing)
You can create the effect of a crowd or chorus by:
- Generating multiple versions of the same phrase using different voices or slightly different parameters (e.g., pitch, speed).
- Layering these audio files together in an audio editor (like Audacity, Ableton, or Logic Pro) and adding slight time delays or pitch variations to simulate the sound of a group.

### 2. **Adjusting Pitch and Timing**
You can use the same text-to-speech output but modify the **pitch** and **timing** slightly for each layer:
- Create one version with a higher pitch (`<prosody pitch="+2st">`)
- Another with a lower pitch (`<prosody pitch="-2st">`)
- Another at normal pitch.

You can also slightly alter the **rate** (`<prosody rate="slow">`) to simulate a less uniform crowd.

### 3. **Using Prosody Tags for Volume and Emphasis**
You can add metatags for **volume** and **emphasis** to simulate a group shouting or singing in unison:

```xml
<speak>
    This word is said by a <prosody pitch="-1st" volume="loud" rate="medium">crowd</prosody>.
</speak>
```

Though this doesn't create a true multi-voice effect, increasing the volume and adding slight variations in pitch can help mimic the sound of a larger group.

### 4. **External Audio Tools for a Chorus Effect**
If Suno doesn't have a native chorus or crowd-simulation feature, you can:
- Export the generated TTS audio.
- Use audio software (e.g., Audacity, Reaper) to apply a **chorus effect**, which simulates multiple voices by duplicating the original signal and applying delays, pitch variation, and modulations.

This method would likely give you the most authentic "chorus" effect.

If you're working with a specific version of Suno or a similar tool, let me know! I can offer more tailored guidance depending on its capabilities.
