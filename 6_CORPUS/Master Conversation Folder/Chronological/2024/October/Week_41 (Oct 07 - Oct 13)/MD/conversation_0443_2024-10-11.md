Subject: Urgent Focus on Year-End Performance and Quota Attainment

Dear Commercial Sales Team,

As we approach the end of the year, it’s crucial to reiterate that the performance of this department has the most direct influence on the year-end financial position of the company. The work you are doing is fundamental to Lumina’s success, and we’re counting on you to finish strong.

Each of you has a quota of 1 MW to sell by Christmas, and I want to be very clear on expectations: no community solar term sheets, no verbal agreements will count. Only signed contracts will be credited towards your quota. Exceptions will be granted solely for projects that are in the redline process and are guaranteed to close once the contract is approved. Please keep in mind that Letters of Engagement (LOEs) will not count towards your quota.

Now is the time to focus on closing deals. If you have any questions or need assistance with specific deals, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. Let's keep pushing forward and ensure we hit our targets.

Best regards,

Subject: Critical Year-End Focus: 1 MW Quota by Christmas

Team,

As we near year-end, I want to stress that the performance of the commercial sales department will have the most direct impact on the company’s financial position. It’s essential that we meet our targets to ensure we close the year on a strong note.

Each of you has a quota of 1 MW to sell by Christmas. Please note that we will only credit signed contracts towards this goal—no community solar term sheets and no verbal commitments will be counted. The only exception to this is if a project is in the redline process and is guaranteed to close once the contract is approved.

LOEs will not count towards your quota.

Please ensure that you are laser-focused on closing contracts. If you need assistance on any deals or require additional support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Let's make this final push a success.

LOEs will be considered on a case-by-case basis. This division's performance will directly impact the company's overall performance. Success puts us in a strong position at the beginning of 2025. Not meeting this very attainable goal will put the viability of this department into question. This is existential.

Subject: Full Commitment to Year-End Success: The Time is Now

Team,

I want to be absolutely clear: the performance of this division will directly impact the company’s overall position as we close out the year. If we succeed, we will start 2025 from a position of strength. However, not meeting the very attainable goal of 1 MW each by Christmas will put the viability of this department in question. This is existential for us.

To demonstrate my commitment, my primary focus will be on working closely with each of you to make this happen. Mark will also be stepping out of his day-to-day managerial responsibilities and carrying the same 1 MW quota as each of you. Please understand: the rubber has met the road. If we do not hit this goal, your positions are not guaranteed come January.

That said, Lumina Solar is fully behind you. We will provide whatever support you need to get these deals across the line. If we need to adjust pricing, consider it done. If you need to attend a networking event, go. If taking a potential client out to dinner will help close the deal, do it. The resources of Lumina Solar are at your disposal—just use them wisely.

This is it. Bring me a deal, and let’s make it happen.

Subject: Critical Year-End Quota and Department's Future

Team,

As we close out the year, it’s important to emphasize that the performance of this department will have the most direct impact on Lumina Solar's year-end financial position. Each of you is responsible for selling 1 MW by Christmas—no community solar term sheets, no verbal agreements will count. We need signed contracts. Exceptions will be granted only for projects in the redline process that are guaranteed to close upon contract approval. LOEs will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

This division's performance is not just critical—it’s existential. Success in meeting this goal will position us strongly as we enter 2025. However, failing to meet this very attainable target will call into question the viability of the department. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

My primary focus for the remainder of the year will be on making this happen. I will be working closely with all of you to ensure that we hit this goal. Mark will be stepping away from his day-to-day managerial responsibilities and carrying the same 1 MW quota as the rest of the team.

Please understand that this is it—this is where the rubber meets the road. If we do not reach our goal by Christmas, your positions will not be guaranteed in January.

That said, the company is fully behind you, and we will support you in every way possible. Bring me deals. If we need to adjust pricing, consider it done. If there’s a networking event you want to attend, go. If you want to take a prospect out to dinner, do it. The resources of Lumina Solar are at your disposal, provided they are used intelligently.

I have full confidence that you can achieve this, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Let’s close out the year strong.

Subject: Urgent: Year-End Quota and Impact on 2025

Team,

As we approach year-end, I need to reinforce the importance of our performance and the direct impact it will have on Lumina’s overall success. This division's performance will dictate where we stand as a company, and it is critical to hit our 1 MW quota by Christmas.

I want to clarify that while community solar term sheets and verbal agreements will not be counted, LOEs will be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, the focus must remain on closing contracts. Signed deals are what will propel us forward into 2025.

Success here puts us in a strong position for the beginning of the new year. On the other hand, not meeting this very attainable goal will call into question the viability of this department. This is existential—our future depends on it.

If there are any challenges or roadblocks preventing you from hitting this target, reach out immediately for support. We are in this together, but we need to execute with urgency and precision.

Let’s make this happen.
