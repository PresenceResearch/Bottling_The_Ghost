The bottom of your monitor should be positioned at or slightly below your eye level when you are seated comfortably. A good rule of thumb is to have the top of the screen at or just below eye level, allowing your eyes to naturally look slightly downward when viewing the center of the screen. The monitor should typically be about 20 to 30 inches (50 to 75 cm) from your eyes to reduce strain.
