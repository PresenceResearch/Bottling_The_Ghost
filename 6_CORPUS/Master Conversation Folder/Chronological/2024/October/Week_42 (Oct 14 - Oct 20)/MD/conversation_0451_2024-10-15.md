The warranty and training offerings mentioned in the IKO-Lumina agreement include:

1. **Warranty**:
   - **Product Warranty**: 20 to 25 years, depending on the system size and whether the installation is done by an REC Certified Solar Professional.
   - **Power Warranty**: 25 years across all system sizes, ensuring power output is maintained at 98% in year one, with a degradation rate of 0.25% annually. By year 25, the power output is guaranteed to be 92%.
   - **Labor Warranty**: For systems installed by an REC Certified Solar Professional, the labor warranty is either 10 or 25 years, depending on the system size.

2. **Training**:
   - No explicit details regarding formal training offerings are provided in the text, but the warranty benefits are clearly tied to the involvement of an REC Certified Solar Professional, suggesting that installers must undergo a certification process to qualify for extended warranties. 

For more detailed information on specific warranty conditions or any additional training requirements, you would need to consult the relevant sections on www.recgroup.com, as referenced in the document【5†source】.

The contract does not explicitly outline post-installation training. Based on the search results, no dedicated section detailing training offerings, either pre- or post-installation, appears in the document. If you need a more in-depth examination of the document or further details, I would recommend checking any referenced external resources or appendices. 

Let me know if you'd like further assistance!
