This strong global orientation appeals to students looking for a truly international experience【7†source】【9†source】.

The university's campus stretches along Commonwealth Avenue, blending seamlessly into the city’s urban landscape. BU students benefit from access to Boston’s vast cultural, historical, and professional opportunities, with the city acting as an extension of the classroom. Few universities offer the same level of engagement with a major metropolitan city【9†source】.

3. **Interdisciplinary Education**: BU stands out for its emphasis on interdisciplinary education through initiatives like the BU Hub, which allows students to explore multiple disciplines outside of their major. This approach encourages cross-departmental learning and a well-rounded academic experience that is not always emphasized at other large institutions【7†source】.

This extensive research focus extends to interdisciplinary centers like the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, which engages students in solving global issues【9†source】.

5. **Inclusive and Diverse Community**: BU has a strong commitment to diversity, both socioeconomically and culturally. About 58% of domestic students are students of color, and the university is known for welcoming first-generation college students and Pell Grant recipients. BU’s diversity fosters a campus environment where students from all backgrounds can succeed, something that many large universities strive for but may not achieve to the same extent【10†source】.

6. **BU’s Commitment to Innovation**: BU is consistently innovating in both its academic programs and extracurricular offerings. For example, the Questrom School of Business has a highly regarded curriculum that integrates technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship into the business world, giving students real-world skills that stand out in comparison to traditional business programs at other large universities【9†source】.

These elements—combined with BU’s urban setting, global focus, commitment to interdisciplinary learning, and robust research opportunities—create a distinctive experience that sets it apart from other large universities.
