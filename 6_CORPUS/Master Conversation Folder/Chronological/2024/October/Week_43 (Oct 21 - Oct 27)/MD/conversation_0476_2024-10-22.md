how much are kwh related and how much are fixed

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-22 14:35:09*

Let's break down the charges into **kWh-related** (variable based on consumption) and **fixed** charges (unchanged regardless of usage):

### kWh-Related Charges:
These charges are based on the total energy consumed (25,721 kWh):
1. **Energy Charge**: $618.13
2. **Franchise Tax (Delivery)**: $15.95 (based on $0.0006200 per kWh)
3. **MD Environmental Surcharge**: $3.86 (based on $0.0001500 per kWh)
4. **EmPOWER Maryland Charge**: $174.00 (based on $0.0067650 per kWh)
5. **Energy Tax**: $520.74 (based on $0.0220459 per kWh)

### Total kWh-Related Charges: **$1,332.68**

### Fixed Charges:
These charges do not depend on energy consumption:
1. **Customer Charge**: $47.56
2. **Maximum Demand**: $385.13 (based on peak kW, not kWh)
3. **Pepco Revenue Deferral Recovery**: $30.76
4. **Universal Service Charge**: $24.56
5. **Gross Receipts Tax**: $26.53 (percentage-based but not directly tied to kWh)
6. **Sales Tax (6%)**: $79.35

### Total Fixed Charges: **$593.89**

### Summary:
- **kWh-Related Charges**: **$1,332.68**
- **Fixed Charges**: **$593.89**

This shows that the majority of the charges are related to your actual electricity consumption (kWh), while the remaining amount is made up of fixed costs and demand-related fees.

**You:**

*2024-10-22 14:35:41*

ok - how much of this is demand related

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-22 14:35:52*

The **demand-related charges** are based on your peak kW usage rather than the total kWh consumed. Here’s the breakdown of demand-related charges on your bill:

### Demand-Related Charges:
1. **Maximum Demand**: $385.13 (based on 101.40 kW at $3.7981262 per kW)

### Summary:
- **Demand-Related Charges**: **$385.13**

This amount represents the cost for your peak demand, which is typically based on the highest power draw (kW) during a specified interval within the billing period.

how much of this shoiuld solar offset

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-22 14:36:18*

To determine how much solar could offset, we need to focus on the **kWh-related charges** since solar panels directly reduce your consumption of electricity (kWh). Solar typically reduces these variable costs but does not directly impact fixed or demand-related charges (unless you install a system with energy storage, which can help reduce demand charges).

### kWh-Related Charges (as previously calculated):
- **Total kWh-Related Charges**: **$1,332.68**

If you install a solar system that produces enough energy to fully meet your kWh consumption (25,721 kWh), in an ideal scenario, solar could offset this entire amount.

### Potential Offset by Solar:
- **$1,332.68** in kWh-related charges could be offset by a sufficiently sized solar installation.

However, keep in mind:
- Solar won’t typically offset **demand-related** or **fixed charges** unless combined with a battery system to lower peak demand.
- The actual offset depends on the size of the solar system, its efficiency, available sunlight, and whether your usage occurs during times when the solar system is generating electricity.

If you want to size a system accurately, you’ll need to know how much energy you use during peak solar production times.
