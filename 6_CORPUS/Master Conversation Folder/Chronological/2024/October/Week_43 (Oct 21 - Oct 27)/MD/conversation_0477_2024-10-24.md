The Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) offers grants and incentives to encourage the development of renewable energy, including commercial solar projects. While details for 2025 specifically might not be fully available yet, here’s a general outline based on prior year grants and the types of incentives typically offered by the MEA for commercial solar installations:

### 1. **Program Overview:**
   - The Maryland Commercial Solar Grant is designed to support businesses, non-profits, and local governments in installing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on their properties.
   - The primary goal is to increase solar energy capacity within the state, reduce reliance on non-renewable energy, and improve energy resilience.
   - The grants often focus on systems over a certain size threshold, generally targeting projects with a larger capacity (e.g., greater than 50 kW).

### 2. **Eligibility Criteria:**
   - **Location:** Projects must be located in Maryland.
   - **Entity Types:** Eligible applicants include commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and government agencies.
   - **System Size:** Systems are typically required to be larger than 50 kW, though there may be different tiers for grant amounts based on system size.
   - **Technology Type:** The system must use solar photovoltaic technology.
   - **Compliance:** Installations must comply with all local, state, and federal laws, and may need to be constructed by a certified contractor.
   - **Existing Grants/Tax Credits:** Applicants who receive other state or federal grants may need to disclose them to avoid double-dipping on funding.

### 3. **Funding Structure:**
   - The grant amount is typically based on the size of the solar installation, with a dollar-per-watt ($/W) cap. For example, past programs have awarded between $0.25/W and $0.50/W.
   - The total award per project is capped, usually up to a few hundred thousand dollars, depending on the system's capacity and energy production.
   - **Funding Cap:** Previous programs have had a per-project maximum (e.g., $250,000 per project) to ensure the budget can cover multiple installations.

### 4. **Application Process:**
   - Applicants submit an initial application outlining the project’s design, expected energy production, and total costs.
   - Applications are reviewed for eligibility, and competitive factors may come into play if funding is limited.
   - The MEA will likely request project financials, timelines, and contractor information.
   - Applicants must also provide documentation after the system is operational to prove installation, such as interconnection agreements and final inspections.

### 5. **Deadlines and Timeline:**
   - Grants are often awarded on a rolling or annual basis, with deadlines typically falling in the spring or summer.
   - It’s crucial to apply as early as possible since funding can be limited and is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis in some years.

### 6. **Additional Benefits:**
   - Projects may also be eligible for **Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)**, where system owners earn credits based on energy production, which can then be sold in the market.
   - MEA may also offer technical assistance and guidance throughout the application and installation process.

To get the most accurate information for 2025, I’d recommend checking the MEA’s website or contacting them directly, as the specifics of the grant may change year to year. You may also want to explore related incentives like Maryland's Solar Investment Tax Credit or PJM capacity market opportunities.
