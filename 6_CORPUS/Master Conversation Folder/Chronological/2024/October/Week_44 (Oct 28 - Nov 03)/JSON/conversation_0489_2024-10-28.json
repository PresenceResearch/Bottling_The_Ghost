          "text": "SOLAR PV SYSTEM DESIGN AGREEMENT\n\n\n\nTHIS SOLAR PV SYSTEM DESIGN AGREEMENT (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made as of the date on which this Agreement is executed by the Parties (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d) between LUMINA SOLAR, INC., a Maryland corporation, with an address of 3600 Commerce Drive, Suite 601, Halethorpe, Maryland 21227 (\u201cContractor\u201d), and JEMAL\u2019S TAKOMA PARK L.L.C., a District of Columbia limited liability company,  with an address of 655 New York Ave NW, Suite 830, Washington, DC 20001 (\u201cCustomer\u201d) (each a \u201cParty\u201d and together, the \u201cParties\u201d) for the design of a solar photovoltaic system (the \u201cSystem\u201d) to be installed at 6856 Eastern Ave, NW Washington, DC 20012 (the \u201cSite\u201d).\n\n\n\n\tSCOPE OF WORK. Contractor shall perform the work and provide the Deliverables (as hereinafter defined) set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (the \u201cDesign Work\u201d). Any work not specified in Schedule 1 shall be deemed \u201cout-of-scope work\u201d (\u201cOut-of-Scope Work\u201d) and if Contractor is requested to perform, and agrees to perform, Out-of-Scope Work, the Parties shall execute a change order specifying the change to the Scope of Work and the increased Fee, if any. Contractor shall not perform Out-of-Scope Work unless and until a Change Order is executed by the Parties. \n\n\n\n\tFEE; PAYMENT.  In consideration of Design Work, Customer shall pay to Contractor a fee of $12,500.00 (the \u201cFee\u201d), with 50% of the Fee being due and payable within three (3) business days of the Effective Date of this Agreement and the balance of the Fee being due and payable within ten (10) days of completion of the Design Work and delivery of the  deliverables referenced in Schedule 1.  The Fee shall not change, except as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement. Customer shall pay the Fee by wire transfer or Automated Clearing House (ACH). Contractor shall not be obligated to commence the Design Work until Customer pays the Fee in full.\n\n\n\n\tACCESS TO THE SITE; COOPERATION. Customer agrees to provide Contractor with reasonable access to the Site for the purposes of performing the Design Work. Customer shall communicate with, secure the cooperation of, and coordinate with all tenants or other entities or individuals present or occupying the Site regarding the Design Work, timing of the Design Work, and access to the Site. In the event Contractor cannot access the Site, or Contractor\u2019s access is impeded, due to Customer\u2019s failure to comply with Customer\u2019s obligations under this Section 3 or the actions of third-parties not under Contractor\u2019s control, then Customer shall reimburse Contractor for all costs and expenses incurred by Contractor as a result. Customer agrees to (i) provide all information reasonably requested by Contractor related to the Site or Design Work, and (ii) execute all applications, permits, consents, and agreements that are reasonably requested by Contractor and are necessary for Contractor to perform the Design Work.\n\n\n\n\tSUBCONTRACTORS. Contractor may, with the prior written consent of Customer, engage subcontractors to perform work hereunder, provided Contractor shall fully pay said subcontractors and in all instances remain responsible for the completion of the work contemplated by this Agreement. Contractor shall ensure that all subcontractors engaged by Contractor shall have all of the insurance required to be obtained and maintained by Contractor pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 9 of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\tTERM; TERMINATION.\n\n\n\n\tTerm. This Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue in full force and effect until all the Design Work is completed or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Section 5.\n\n\n\n\tTermination. This Agreement may be terminated (i) by either Party upon thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice to the other Party; (ii) by written agreement of the parties; or (iii) by Contractor immediately upon written notice to Customer if at any point it is determined by Contractor, in its sole discretion, that the existing elements of the Site are incapable of supporting the System.\n\n\n\n\tEffect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated, then Contractor shall refund the Fee to the Customer, less Contractor\u2019s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in performing the Services at the rates set forth in Schedule 2, plus twenty percent (20%) of the amount of such reasonable costs and expenses as overhead and profit component. Contractor will provide all completed Deliverables to Customer within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination; provided there are no outstanding payments due to Contractor pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\tEPCA. Upon completion of the Design Work and approval of the System design by Customer, the Contractor will submit an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement (\u201cEPCA\u201d) for the construction of the System to the Customer. The Parties agree to negotiate the EPCA in good faith. If the Parties execute the EPCA for the construction of the System, the Fee shall be credited towards the EPCA total contract price. The Parties intend for the EPCA to supersede this Agreement upon execution of the EPCA., provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in such EPCA, any liabilities of either party that shall have accrued as of the date of execution of the EPCA shall remain full force and effect and may be enforced by the parties in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable law. \n\n\n\n\tEXCLUSIVITY. In consideration of the time, effort, allocation of resources, opportunity costs, and expenses to be undertaken by Contractor in connection with this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and in furtherance of the Parties obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement, the Customer agrees that during the Term and for two (2) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement (\u201cExclusivity Period\u201d), Customer hereby agrees that the Customer shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its directors, officers, employees, contractors, or representatives (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or take any action to facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal from a person or group of persons other than Contractor and its affiliates that may constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, the execution of an EPCA or similar agreement for the design and construction of a solar photovoltaic system at the Site (\u201cAlternative Transaction\u201d); (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person or group of persons other than Contractor and its affiliates regarding an Alternative Transaction; (iii) furnish any non-public information relating to the Customer or the Site to any person or group of persons other than Contractor, in all cases for the purpose of assisting with or facilitating an Alternative Transaction; or (iv) enter into an Alternative Transaction or any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, including, without limitation, any letter of intent, term sheet, or other similar document, relating to an Alternative Transaction. Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, the Customer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, terminate any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any person or group of persons other than Contractor and its affiliates regarding an Alternative Transaction. \n\n\n\n\tCONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n\n\n\tGeneral.  Except as required under applicable law, each Party shall hold in confidence all terms and provisions of this Agreement, all documents and other information, whether technical or commercial, relating to this Agreement or the design, financing, construction, ownership, operation or maintenance of the System that is of a business nature related to the System or the Design Work and that is supplied to it by or on behalf of the other Party.  The Party receiving such documents or information shall not publish, use or otherwise disclose any such documents or information other than as necessary to fulfill the terms of this Agreement or in connection with legal proceedings to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that a Party may disclose such information to the extent necessary to its professional advisers, or potential or actual lenders or investors, or potential or actual subcontractors in connection with this Agreement, each of whom shall have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information in compliance with the requirements of this Section 8.  Each Party shall require its proposed or actual professional advisors, investors, lenders, or subcontractors to comply with the requirements of this Section 8 in respect of confidential information.\n\n\n\n\tExceptions. The provisions of this Section 8 shall not apply to information within any one of the following categories or any combination thereof:\n\n\n\n\tinformation that was in the public domain prior to the receiving Party\u2019s receipt or that subsequently becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, except as a result of a breach of this Section 8; or\n\n\n\n\tinformation that the receiving Party can demonstrate was in its possession prior to receipt thereof from the disclosing Party and not otherwise subject to an obligation of confidentiality; or\n\n\n\n\tinformation received by a Party from a third party having no obligation of non-disclosure with respect thereto; or\n\n\n\n\tinformation that is independently developed by the receiving Party, its representatives or affiliates, without reference to the confidential information received from the disclosing Party.\n\n\n\n\tRequired Disclosure.  Either Party, if required by Law, by any governmental authority having jurisdiction or in the course of administrative or judicial proceedings, to disclose information that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this Section 8 may make disclosure notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8; provided, that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law and if time permits, the Party making the disclosure shall immediately notify the other Party of the requirement and the terms thereof and shall cooperate to the maximum extent practicable to minimize the disclosure of the information.  The Party disclosing such information shall use reasonable efforts, at the other Party\u2019s cost, to obtain proprietary or confidential treatment of such information by the third party to whom the information is disclosed, and to the extent such remedies are available, shall use reasonable efforts to seek protective orders limiting the dissemination and use of the information.  This Agreement does not alter or limit the rights of either Party to object to the rule, regulation, order or proceedings requiring such disclosure.  Nothing in this Agreement shall bar the right of either Party to seek and obtain from any court injunctive relief against conduct or threatened conduct which violates this Section 8.\n\n\n\n\tINSURANCE; INDEMNIFICATION. \n\n\n\nContractor warrants that it has and will maintain insurance coverage required by applicable laws and adequate for the work being performed, specifically including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Occurrence-based commercial general liability insurance with a combined single limit of not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence for bodily injury and property damage, with an annual aggregate limit of $2,000,000; (b) Professional liability (errors & omissions) with a limit of $3,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate; (c) Umbrella excess liability coverage with an annual aggregate limit of not less than $3,000,000; and (d) Workers compensation insurance as required by law. Contractor shall name Customer as an additional insured as to each of Contractor\u2019s (i) commercial general liability insurance policy, (ii) professional liability insurance, and (iii) umbrella liability policy, and Contractor shall obtain a waiver of subrogation in favor of Customer with respect to the worker\u2019s compensation policy.  In the event that Contractor, with the prior written consent of Customer, subcontracts any portion of the Design Work then such design or engineering professional (or firm) shall procure and maintain all of the insurance required to be obtained and maintained by Contractor pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section 9 (unless such work does not involve design or engineering, in which event the professional liability insurance shall not be required of such subcontractor but all other insurance required of Contractor shall be required of such subcontractor). The insurance required to be maintained by Contractor and its subcontractors shall include contractual liability rider.  Within ten (10) days after the execution of this Agreement, Contractor shall provide or cause to be provided evidence that Contractor and its subtractors, if any, are in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Section 9.1. \n\n\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Customer, its officers, members, manager, employees, agents, contractors, and lenders harmless from and against all losses, claims, costs, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements), to the extent arising out of or in connection with: (1) any errors, omissions or negligence in the performance of the Design Services by Contractor and/or any agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors of Contractor; (2) any fines or penalties incurred by reason of Contractor\u2019s violation of any applicable laws in connection with the Design Services; (3) any infringement of patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights belonging to third parties in connection with the presence of Contractor\u2019s agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors on the Property; and (4) any damage to property or injury or death to persons caucused by Contractor or any of its agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors in connection with the performance of the Design Services or in connection with the presence of Customer, its officers, members, manager, employees, agents, contractors on the Property.

            "Yes, the redlines in this contract appear reasonable and align with industry standards for commercial solar design agreements. Here\u2019s a breakdown of why each key point is typically expected or beneficial in such agreements:\n\n1. **Scope of Work**: This defines the services Lumina will provide, including assessing structural integrity and identifying potential added costs upfront, which minimizes surprises during construction. Clarifying \u201cout-of-scope\u201d work is also common to prevent unexpected demands on the contractor.\n\n2. **Fee and Payment Terms**: The split payment structure (50% upfront, 50% upon completion) is standard for design projects, balancing cash flow for the contractor and accountability for completing deliverables. Restricting fee changes helps both parties budget accurately.\n\n3. **Site Access**: Requiring the customer to ensure access prevents costly delays that could be out of Lumina\u2019s control. This also encourages collaboration with tenants or others on-site, which is crucial for smooth project execution.\n\n4. **Subcontractors**: Allowing subcontractors with prior approval and insurance requirements protects the customer\u2019s interests and assures quality. Many contractors rely on specialists for tasks like structural analysis, so this flexibility is practical.\n\n5. **Termination Clauses**: These clauses allow both parties to exit the agreement under fair conditions. The refund structure based on incurred costs and overhead is a balanced approach, protecting Lumina\u2019s expenses while offering partial refund potential to the customer.\n\n6. **EPCA**: Establishing a pathway from design to construction with an EPCA credit incentivizes Lumina to complete quality design work with the potential for a larger project ahead. This structure is fair, especially when the initial design is intended to lead into construction.\n\n7. **Exclusivity**: This protects Lumina from expending resources on a design only for the customer to potentially use the plans with another contractor. The two-month exclusivity period is relatively short and fair, protecting both parties.\n\n8. **Insurance and Indemnification**: Requiring Lumina to carry general liability, professional liability, and worker\u2019s compensation insurance is industry-standard and protects the customer from third-party claims or accidents related to the work. Indemnification provisions ensure that Lumina is accountable for its own errors or violations.\n\n9. **Confidentiality**: Maintaining confidentiality of design details and terms is standard, especially given the proprietary nature of solar design and pricing structures. The exceptions are reasonable and ensure compliance with legal requirements.\n\n10. **Governing Law**: Using the jurisdiction where the site is located (Washington, D.C.) is a logical choice, and selecting a single venue prevents forum-shopping in disputes.\n\nThese provisions set clear expectations, protect both parties, and reflect common practices in commercial solar design agreements."

            "Registering for Vendor Connect can vary in detail depending on the specific platform or organization running the Vendor Connect system. However, in general, the process is moderately detailed and typically requires:\n\n1. **Basic Business Information**: You'll need to provide your company name, address, tax identification number, and primary contact details. This step is usually straightforward but requires official documentation, like a business license or proof of incorporation.\n\n2. **Business Classification and Certifications**: Many Vendor Connect platforms will ask for specific information about the type of business (e.g., small business, minority-owned, veteran-owned) along with any related certifications. You may need to upload certificates to verify these classifications.\n\n3. **Banking and Financial Details**: To streamline payments, Vendor Connect registration often requires your bank details, including routing and account numbers, which may need official bank letters or voided checks as verification.\n\n4. **Insurance and Compliance Documents**: Most Vendor Connect systems will ask for insurance information, particularly liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Uploading these documents is usually required to ensure compliance with the vendor\u2019s standards.\n\n5. **Product/Service Categories**: Specifying the products or services your company provides is essential. This helps ensure you\u2019re matched with relevant opportunities. Some systems may have standardized categories, so you\u2019ll select from a list or checkboxes rather than entering free text.\n\n6. **Vendor Agreements and Terms**: Reading and agreeing to vendor terms and conditions is a common step. These may include terms related to liability, data protection, and service standards, and often require an e-signature.\n\n7. **Background Checks and Compliance**: Some Vendor Connect programs include background or compliance checks, especially if they work with sensitive sectors. This might involve a criminal background check or confirmation of regulatory compliance, depending on the industry.\n\n8. **References and Past Performance**: Certain Vendor Connect programs, especially in sectors like construction or utilities, request references or details about past work. You may need to provide contact information for previous clients or upload documentation of completed projects.\n\n9. **Review and Approval**: Once the application is submitted, there\u2019s usually a review process where the Vendor Connect team evaluates your documentation and eligibility. Some programs may provide conditional access while certain documents are pending.\n\nOverall, the process is generally more detailed than a standard vendor registration, focusing on compliance and proper qualification, but usually remains straightforward if you have the necessary documentation ready."
