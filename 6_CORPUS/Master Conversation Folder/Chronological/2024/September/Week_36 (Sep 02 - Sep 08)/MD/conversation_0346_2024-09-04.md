From the image, it looks like these are wild or crab apples, which are generally safe to eat, though they may be sour or bitter. However, I cannot definitively identify the specific variety or confirm if they are entirely safe to eat without more information. If you are unsure, it is best to consult a local expert or avoid consuming them. Additionally, be aware of any signs of pests or disease on the fruit before deciding to eat them.

The apple in the image appears to be a small variety, possibly a crab apple or another wild apple species. Generally, crab apples are edible but can be quite tart or sour. While they are safe to eat in small amounts, they are usually used in cooking (like making jellies or sauces) rather than eaten raw due to their flavor.

However, it's important to ensure that the apple hasn't been treated with any pesticides or other chemicals and to be cautious if you aren't completely sure of the variety. If in doubt, consult a local horticulturist or foraging expert to confirm the safety of the fruit.
