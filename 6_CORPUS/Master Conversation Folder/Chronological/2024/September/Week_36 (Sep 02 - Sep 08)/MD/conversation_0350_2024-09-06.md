To unhide hidden tabs (worksheets) in Excel, follow these steps:

1. **Right-Click on Any Sheet Tab**: Right-click on any visible sheet tab at the bottom of the Excel window.
   
2. **Select "Unhide..."**: From the context menu, choose "Unhide...".

3. **Choose the Hidden Sheet**: A dialog box will appear showing a list of all hidden sheets. Select the sheet you want to unhide.

4. **Click "OK"**: Click the "OK" button, and the selected hidden sheet will become visible.

If you have multiple hidden sheets, you will need to repeat these steps for each one, as Excel only allows you to unhide one sheet at a time.

Alternatively, if the "Unhide..." option is greyed out, there may be no hidden sheets, or the workbook might be protected. In such cases, you would need to unprotect the workbook first.

To unhide hidden cells (usually rows or columns) in Google Sheets, follow these steps:

### To Unhide Hidden Rows:

1. **Look for Hidden Rows**: Identify the hidden rows by looking for a small arrow icon between the row numbers on the left side of the sheet. For example, if rows 3 and 5 are visible, and row 4 is hidden, you will see a small arrow between rows 3 and 5.

2. **Select the Rows Around the Hidden Row**: Click and drag to select the rows directly above and below the hidden row (e.g., select rows 3 and 5 to unhide row 4).

3. **Right-Click on the Selected Rows**: Right-click anywhere on the selected rows.

4. **Click "Unhide Rows"**: In the context menu, click on "Unhide rows." The hidden rows will now appear.

### To Unhide Hidden Columns:

1. **Look for Hidden Columns**: Identify the hidden columns by looking for a small arrow icon between the column letters at the top of the sheet. For example, if columns B and D are visible, and column C is hidden, you will see a small arrow between B and D.

2. **Select the Columns Around the Hidden Column**: Click and drag to select the columns directly to the left and right of the hidden column (e.g., select columns B and D to unhide column C).

3. **Right-Click on the Selected Columns**: Right-click anywhere on the selected columns.

4. **Click "Unhide Columns"**: In the context menu, click on "Unhide columns." The hidden columns will now appear.

### Shortcut Method:
- If you are unsure where the hidden rows or columns are, you can select the entire sheet by clicking the rectangle in the upper left corner (where the row numbers and column letters meet). Then, right-click anywhere in the selection and choose "Unhide rows" or "Unhide columns." This will unhide all hidden rows or columns in the sheet.

This should help you quickly reveal any hidden cells in Google Sheets!

what is the NPV of $5000 per year worth of savings for 25 years 

---

**Assistant:**

To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of $5,000 per year in savings for 25 years, you need to know the discount rate, which represents the rate of return or interest rate that would be applied to the savings over time.

The NPV is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{NPV} = \sum \left( \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} \right)
\]

where:
- \(C_t\) is the cash flow for year \(t\) (in this case, $5,000 each year).
- \(r\) is the discount rate.
- \(t\) is the year (from 1 to 25).

If you provide a specific discount rate (like 5% or 7%), I can calculate the exact NPV for you. Without a specific rate, we can't determine the precise NPV. 

Would you like to provide a discount rate, or should I use a common default rate like 5% or 7%?
