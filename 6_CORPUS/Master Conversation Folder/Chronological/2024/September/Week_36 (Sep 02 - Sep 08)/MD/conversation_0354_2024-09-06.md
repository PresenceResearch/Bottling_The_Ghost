The watch in the image is a vintage-style wristwatch with a Rolex branding on the dial. It features a beige or off-white face with large, bold black numerals and a subdial at the 9 o'clock position, which appears to be a seconds counter. The hour markers are a mix of Roman and Arabic numerals (e.g., "X" for 10 and "4" as an Arabic numeral), which is an unusual combination. The watch has a classic design with a large, round case, and it is paired with a brown leather strap. The crown is relatively large, and the hands are in a classic, straight style with a simple, elegant appearance. 

This combination of design elements suggests a retro or vintage-inspired piece, possibly a homage or replica, given some design aspects that don't align with typical Rolex watches.
