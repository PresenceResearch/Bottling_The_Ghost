At many colleges, including Boston College, legacy status generally refers to applicants who have a parent (biological or adoptive) who is an alum. While your son's stepmother being a BC grad may not carry the same weight as a biological or adoptive parent in traditional legacy considerations, it still demonstrates a strong family connection to the school. 

It's best to check directly with Boston College's admissions office, as they can provide the most accurate guidance regarding how they consider step-parent legacy in their admissions process.
