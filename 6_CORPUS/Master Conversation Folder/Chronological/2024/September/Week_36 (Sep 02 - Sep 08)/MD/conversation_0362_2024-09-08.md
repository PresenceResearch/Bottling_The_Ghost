The ideal space between the top of a lamp and the bottom of a picture frame is typically around 3 to 6 inches. This spacing allows for a balanced and visually pleasing arrangement while ensuring that neither the lamp nor the picture appears cramped or crowded. The exact distance can vary depending on the size and scale of the lamp and the artwork, as well as the overall design and layout of the room.
