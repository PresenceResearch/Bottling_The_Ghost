---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-08 18:16:46*

The time it takes to receive a green card after submitting a full application can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of green card being applied for (family-based, employment-based, etc.), the applicant's country of origin, and the specific U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processing center handling the case. 

On average, the following timeframes can be expected:

1. **Family-Based Green Card:**
   - **Immediate Relatives (spouses, parents, and unmarried children under 21 of U.S. citizens):** Typically, it can take between 10 to 13 months, but this can vary based on USCIS processing times.
   - **Family Preference Categories (siblings, married children, etc.):** Processing times can range from 1 year to over 10 years, depending on the applicant's country and the specific preference category.

2. **Employment-Based Green Card:**
   - **EB-1 (priority workers) and EB-2 (professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability):** It can take from 1 to 3 years, depending on the applicant's country and visa availability.
   - **EB-3 (skilled workers, professionals, and other workers):** This can range from 2 to 10 years, influenced by country quotas and priority dates.

3. **Diversity Visa Lottery:** 
   - Winners can expect to receive their green card within 6 to 12 months after submitting all the required documents.

4. **Adjustment of Status:** 
   - If applying from within the U.S. via an adjustment of status (Form I-485), it usually takes 8 to 14 months, but this can also vary based on the applicant's category, location, and case complexity.

It is also important to consider potential delays due to factors like backlogs, additional requests for evidence, or the need for an interview. For the most accurate and current timeframe, you can check the USCIS website or use their case processing time tool.

The Boston Acoustics CR400 subwoofer is a powered subwoofer designed to enhance the low-frequency performance of a home audio system. Here are some of its key features:

### Key Specifications and Features:
1. **Power Output**: The CR400 is equipped with an internal amplifier, typically rated at around 100-150 watts RMS (continuous power) with a peak power output that may be higher. This power level is sufficient for providing substantial bass in small to medium-sized rooms.

2. **Driver Size**: The subwoofer usually comes with a 10-inch or 12-inch long-throw woofer, designed to produce deep bass with minimal distortion.

3. **Frequency Response**: The frequency response range for the CR400 is generally from around 30 Hz to 150 Hz, which allows it to reproduce the deep bass frequencies that most bookshelf or tower speakers may not reach.

4. **Crossover Control**: The CR400 features an adjustable crossover frequency control, which allows the user to set the point where the subwoofer takes over from the main speakers, typically adjustable between 40 Hz and 150 Hz.

5. **Phase Switch**: It includes a phase switch (usually 0 or 180 degrees) to ensure the subwoofer is in phase with the other speakers in the system, optimizing bass integration and minimizing cancellations.

6. **Input Connections**: The subwoofer typically features both line-level inputs (RCA jacks) for connection to a receiver or preamplifier, and speaker-level inputs for more flexible connectivity options, allowing integration with a variety of systems.

7. **Build Quality**: Boston Acoustics products are known for their solid build quality. The CR400 is usually housed in a well-constructed wooden enclosure designed to minimize vibration and enhance acoustic performance.

8. **Design**: The subwoofer has a sleek and simple design, often with a black wood or vinyl finish that can blend in with most home audio setups.

### Performance:
The Boston Acoustics CR400 is well-regarded for its ability to produce tight, accurate bass that enhances music, movies, and other audio content. It offers good value for those looking for a reliable subwoofer without breaking the bank. While it may not compete with some of the more premium subwoofer models on the market, it is a solid performer in its price range, delivering clear and impactful low-frequency sound.

### Conclusion:
The CR400 subwoofer is an excellent choice for users looking to add depth and richness to their home audio system. Its solid construction, user-friendly controls, and reliable performance make it a suitable option for enhancing the listening experience, particularly in smaller to medium-sized rooms.

How do you connect it to a receiver 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-09-08 20:41:28*

To connect a Boston Acoustics CR400 subwoofer to a receiver, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Determine the Connection Type on Your Receiver:**
   - Most modern receivers have a dedicated subwoofer output labeled as “SUB OUT” or “LFE OUT” (Low-Frequency Effects). This is typically a single RCA jack.
   - Some older or budget receivers may not have a subwoofer output, in which case you might need to use speaker-level connections.

#### 2. **Using an RCA (Line-Level) Connection:**
   - **Find the “SUB OUT” or “LFE OUT” on the Receiver:** Locate this output on the back panel of your receiver.
   - **Connect an RCA Cable:** Use a subwoofer cable or a standard RCA cable to connect from the “SUB OUT” or “LFE OUT” on your receiver to the “LINE IN” input on the subwoofer. The “LINE IN” is usually a pair of RCA jacks on the subwoofer.
     - **Note:** If your subwoofer has left (L) and right (R) inputs and your receiver has a single subwoofer output, you can use either the left or right input, or use a Y-splitter cable to connect both inputs for maximum signal strength.
   - **Set the Subwoofer to “Line In” Mode:** Ensure that the subwoofer is set to the correct input mode, usually by flipping a switch to "Line In" if it has multiple input options.

#### 3. **Using Speaker-Level Connections (If Necessary):**
   - **Locate Speaker Outputs on the Receiver:** Identify the speaker output terminals on your receiver, which are typically marked for front left and right speakers.
   - **Connect Speaker Wires:** 
     - Run speaker wires from the receiver’s speaker terminals to the corresponding speaker-level input terminals on the subwoofer (marked “Speaker In” or similar).
   - **Connect the Speakers to the Subwoofer:** 
     - You will also need to connect your front left and right speakers to the “Speaker Out” terminals on the subwoofer if using this method.
   - **Configure Crossover Settings:** Adjust the crossover settings on both the subwoofer and the receiver to ensure the low frequencies are routed to the subwoofer correctly.

#### 4. **Power On and Configure Settings:**
   - **Power on the Subwoofer and Receiver:** Plug both devices into a power source and turn them on.
   - **Adjust Subwoofer Settings:** Set the crossover frequency on the subwoofer to match your main speakers (typically around 80 Hz for most setups), and set the volume/gain control to a medium level.
   - **Adjust Receiver Settings:** On the receiver, go into the speaker setup menu and configure it to recognize the subwoofer. Set the speaker size (small or large) and crossover frequency appropriately.

### Tips:
- **Phase Control:** Use the phase switch (0 or 180 degrees) to match the subwoofer's phase to the main speakers, improving bass integration.
- **Placement:** Place the subwoofer in a location where it delivers the best bass response in your room, usually along the front wall or in a corner.

By following these steps, you should have a properly connected and configured subwoofer that enhances your audio experience.
