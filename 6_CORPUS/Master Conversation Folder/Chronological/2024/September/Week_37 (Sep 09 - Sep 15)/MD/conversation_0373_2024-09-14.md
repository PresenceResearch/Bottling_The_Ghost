The sewing machine in the images appears to be a vintage model with a motor labeled "Dynamic Sewing Motor," made in Japan. Based on the design details, such as the ornate floral decorations and the metal construction, this machine seems to be an older, heavy-duty, manual model likely from the mid-20th century or earlier. 

The motor attached to the machine indicates that it was adapted for electric use at some point, as older sewing machines were primarily operated by foot pedals or hand cranks before motors were standard. The "Dynamic" motor suggests it was manufactured in Japan, which became a significant hub for sewing machine production post-World War II, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s.

If you are looking for more specific information, such as the exact model or brand, you may want to look for any additional markings or serial numbers on the machine's body, which could provide clues to its make and year of manufacture.

Based on the design, style, and the "Dynamic Sewing Motor" label made in Japan, the sewing machine likely dates from the 1950s to the 1960s. This period saw a significant influx of Japanese-made sewing machines into Western markets, often as replacements or upgrades for older treadle-operated models. 

The ornate floral details and the machine's overall heavy-duty metal construction suggest it is from a time when machines were built to last, which aligns with models produced during the mid-20th century. The motor’s addition could also indicate a transitional period when manual machines were being adapted for electric use, which was common around the 1950s. 

To determine its precise age, check for a serial number or additional branding marks often located on the base or sides of the machine. These numbers can sometimes be cross-referenced with manufacturer records to pinpoint the exact year of production.

The bottle you have appears to be an old medicinal or flavoring product. The label reads "T. Noirot's," which could indicate a brand associated with apothecaries, perfumers, or food flavoring in the past. The term "Non-Alcoholic Flavor" suggests that it is a flavoring extract or concentrate, likely used in cooking, baking, or making beverages. The label also includes the word "Reverendine Liqueur," which might hint at it being a non-alcoholic substitute for a type of liqueur flavor.

The small size of the bottle (indicated as "Net Contents: 3/4 Fl. Oz.") suggests it was sold for personal or household use, potentially in the early to mid-20th century. These types of bottles were commonly used to hold extracts, tinctures, or flavor concentrates.

If you're looking for more specific historical information, you might check for any manufacturing details or serial numbers on the bottle, or try researching "T. Noirot's" in historical archives or databases that document vintage consumer goods.

The bottle labeled "T. Noirot's" appears to contain a flavoring extract or concentrate, likely used to make a flavored liqueur or syrup. The label provides directions for use with different types of alcohol:

1. **With alcohol (190 Proof or 95%):** Dissolve 1 cup and 1/2 cup of sugar with 1 cup of warm water. Allow it to cool, then transfer to a 1-quart bottle, add the contents of this vial, and top up with alcohol (190 Proof). Shake well.

2. **With Vodka or alcohol (80 Proof or 40%):** Pour 1 cup and 1/2 of sugar into a 1-quart bottle, add the contents of this vial, and top up with Vodka (80 Proof). Shake well.

The bottle is labeled "Printed in France," suggesting it was produced in France, and it seems intended for making a homemade liqueur or flavoring syrup by mixing with alcohol and sugar.

This type of product was likely used for home brewing or flavoring drinks, common in earlier times when people often made their own liqueurs or syrups at home. The age of the bottle is not specified, but the style and language on the label suggest it could be from the early to mid-20th century.

The picture appears to be a vintage wedding photograph, likely taken in the early to mid-20th century, given the style of the clothing and the formal arrangement of the bridal party. The bride is in the center, wearing a traditional wedding gown and veil, surrounded by bridesmaids and groomsmen dressed in formal attire. The presence of a uniformed man suggests that this could have been taken during or after a wartime period, possibly World War II, when military uniforms were commonly worn at weddings.

The label on the back, from "Atlantic Picture Frame Co." at 1113 Broadway, Brooklyn, N.Y., indicates that the photograph was professionally framed by a local framing company. The inclusion of a phone number with an exchange name ("Glenmore 5-4984") suggests a time frame from the 1920s to the 1960s, as this style of phone number was commonly used in New York City and other large American cities during that period.

This photograph likely holds sentimental or historical value, possibly being a family heirloom or a piece of local history from Brooklyn, New York. The photograph’s age, combined with its setting and framing style, suggests it captures a moment from mid-20th century America.

The "Atlantic Picture Frame Co." located at 1113 Broadway, Brooklyn, N.Y., was a business specializing in picture framing and the restoration of paintings. The use of a local business phone number with an exchange name ("Glenmore 5-4984") indicates that this company was likely in operation from the 1920s through the 1960s, a period when phone numbers in New York used such alphanumeric formats.

The frame shop was probably a small, local business catering to residents of Brooklyn and the surrounding areas, providing custom framing services for photographs, artwork, and other items needing preservation or display. Shops like Atlantic Picture Frame Co. were common in urban areas, offering personalized services before the widespread availability of mass-produced frames and the advent of large chain stores.

There isn't much readily available detailed historical information specifically about the Atlantic Picture Frame Co., as it seems to have been a relatively small and local operation. However, its location on Broadway in Brooklyn places it in a busy, vibrant area of the city, suggesting it might have served a diverse clientele, including local artists, photographers, and families wanting to preserve important memories or artworks.

If you want more precise details, you could consider looking at historical directories, archives, or local newspapers from Brooklyn, New York, from the mid-20th century, which might have advertisements or mentions of the shop. Additionally, contacting local historical societies or libraries in Brooklyn may provide further information.

This photograph appears to be an older portrait of three young children, likely from the early 20th century. The style of clothing, including the two boys' sailor suits and the girl's simple dress, suggests it could be from the 1920s or 1930s. 

Sailor suits were a popular style for young boys during this time, especially in Western countries. The sailor suits feature emblems on the sleeves, possibly indicating a nautical theme or affiliation, which was common in children’s fashion. The girl is wearing a dress with short sleeves, typical of the period's children’s attire, along with short socks and shoes.

The photograph has a formal, studio-like quality, with the children posed carefully, suggesting it was likely taken to commemorate a special occasion or as a family portrait. The sepia tone and the overall style of the photograph reinforce its age and period.

This picture might hold sentimental value as a family heirloom, and it offers a glimpse into the fashion and portrait styles of the early 20th century. If you have more information, such as names or dates, it could help in identifying the children or the context of the photograph more specifically.
