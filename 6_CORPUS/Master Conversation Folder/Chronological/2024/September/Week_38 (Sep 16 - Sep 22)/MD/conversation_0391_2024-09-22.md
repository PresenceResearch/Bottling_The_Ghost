Yes, you can place a monitor on top of a Mac mini, but it's generally not recommended. The Mac mini has ventilation openings, and placing a monitor on top might restrict airflow, leading to potential overheating. If you do decide to put a monitor on top, make sure there's enough space to allow for adequate ventilation, or consider using a stand to elevate the monitor slightly above the Mac mini to avoid blocking the vents.
