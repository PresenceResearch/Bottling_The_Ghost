Proc. 2024-19 \n \n \nSECTION 1. PURPOSE \n \n     This revenue procedure provides the process under \u00a7 48(e) of the Internal Revenue \n\nCode (Code)1 to apply for an allocation of environmental justice solar and wind capacity \n\nlimitation (Capacity Limitation) as part of the low-income communities bonus credit \n\nprogram (Program) for 2024 (2024 Program year).  Solely with respect to the 2024 \n\nProgram year, this revenue procedure supersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27, 2023-35 I.R.B. \n\n655, and provides important clarifying changes to the application, documentation, and \n\nlottery procedures that apply to the 2024 Program year.  In addition, this revenue \n\nprocedure describes how the Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year will be \n\ndivided across the facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) and 1.48(e)-1(b)(2), \n\n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all \u201csection\u201d or \u201c\u00a7\u201d references are to sections of the Code or the Income Tax \nRegulations (26 CFR part 1). \n\n\n\n-2- \n\nthe Category 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), and the additional \n\nselection criteria application options described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h).  Receipt of an \n\nallocation increases the amount of an energy investment credit determined under \n\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the \n\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7. APPLICATION PROCESS \n\n     .01 Registration in general.  Applicants must register in the Portal before they can \n\nbegin the application process.  Potential applicants should follow DOE\u2019s publicly \n\navailable procedures to register in the Portal and to submit applications.  To register, \n\napplicants must first create a login.gov account before accessing the Portal.  After a \n\nlogin.gov account has been created, the user can register as the applicant in the Portal.  \n\nSee the Applicant User Guide, which can be found on the Program Homepage, for more \n\ninformation.  Applications may be submitted only through the Portal.  \n\n     .02 Application Submission.  The applicant must submit their application, including \n\nany required information, documentation, and attestations required by section 7 of this \n\nrevenue procedure, under penalties of perjury.  The person completing and submitting \n\nthe application must have personal knowledge of the facts related to the application and \n\nbe a person who is legally authorized to (1) bind the applicant entity for federal income \n\ntax purposes, including providing, under penalties of perjury, the attestations under \n\nsections 7.06, 7.07, 7.08 and 10.02 of this revenue procedure; (2) communicate with \n\nDOE about the application prior to and after submission of the application; and \n\n(3) receive notifications, letters, and other communications from DOE and the IRS about \n\nthe Program.  For example, an application may be authorized by an officer of a \n\ncorporation, a general partner of a state law partnership, a member-manager on behalf \n\nof a limited liability company, a trustee on behalf of a trust, or the proprietor in the case \n\nof a sole proprietorship.  The person submitting the application must attest through the \n\n\n\n-8- \n\nPortal that they have the requisite authority to legally bind the applicant with respect to \n\nfederal income tax matters.  \n\n     .03 Applicant Information.  The application must include the following identifying \n\ninformation of the applicant: \n\n        (1) The name of the applicant; \n\n        (2) The unique federal taxpayer identification number for the applicant.  Unless a \n\ntransfer request is reviewed and approved by the IRS or the unincorporated \n\norganization has made a \u00a7 761(a) election to be excluded from the application of \n\nsubchapter K (see section 13 of this revenue procedure), the taxpayer identification \n\nnumber of the applicant must match the taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer \n\nthat will claim the energy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e), or, in the case of a \n\npartnership or S corporation, the partnership or S corporation that owns the facility when \n\nit is placed in service;  \n\n        (3) The applicant\u2019s address;  \n\n        (4) If the applicant is a subsidiary corporation of a consolidated group filing a \n\nconsolidated federal income tax return, the legal name and federal taxpayer \n\nidentification number of the parent corporation of the consolidated group; and  \n\n        (5) Any other information required by DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures. \n\n     .04 Facility Information.   \n\n        (1) In general.

REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS \n\n     .01 In general.  DOE will review applications for the Program and provide a \n\n \n11 Maps that capture applicable census tracts are available in DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures \nto assist applicants. \n\n\n\n-23- \n\nrecommendation to the IRS regarding whether to award an applicant an amount of \n\nCapacity Limitation with respect to a facility.  Based on DOE\u2019s recommendation, the IRS \n\nwill award the applicant a Capacity Limitation allocation or reject the application.   \n\n     .02 Order of application review and recommendation for allocation.   \n\n        (1) First 30 days.  When the application period opens for the 2024 Program year, \n\nthere will be a 30-day period during which applications will initially be accepted for each \n\nfacility category.  All applications submitted within the first 30-days will be treated as \n\nsubmitted on the same date and at the same time.  DOE will publicly announce on the \n\nProgram Homepage the opening and closing dates of the 30-day period.  All \n\napplications submitted by 11:59 PM ET on the closing date will be considered submitted \n\nduring the initial 30-day period.  Refer to section 8.02(3) of this revenue procedure for \n\ninformation regarding the lottery for applications submitted during the first 30 days in \n\noversubscribed facility categories or Category 1 sub-reservations.     \n\n        (2) Applications submitted after the 30-day period.  Following the 30-day period, \n\nDOE will continue to accept applications until the close of the 2024 Program application \n\nperiod.  Provided there is remaining Capacity Limitation in a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation, DOE will review applications submitted in those facility \n\ncategories or Category 1 sub-reservation after the 30-day period.  Within each facility \n\ncategory or Category 1 sub-reservation, DOE will make recommendations for an \n\nallocation of Capacity Limitation with respect to applications submitted after the close of \n\nthe 30-day period in the order in which applications are received in a particular facility \n\ncategory or Category 1 sub-reservation.  The IRS will award Capacity Limitation \n\nallocations in the order that it receives recommendations from DOE.    \n\n\n\n-24- \n\n        (3) Lottery for applications submitted during the 30-day period.  For oversubscribed \n\nfacility categories and Category 1 sub-reservations, DOE will conduct a lottery at the \n\nend of the 30-day period described in section 8.02(1) of this revenue procedure for \n\napplications submitted during that period.  The lottery is conducted prior to application \n\nreview.  Lottery scores will be used to determine which qualified facilities are eligible for \n\na recommendation for an allocation of Capacity Limitation if a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed.  Refer to section 8.03(2) of this revenue \n\nprocedure for information regarding how applications meeting Additional Selection \n\nCriteria are prioritized over other applications.  Regardless of an application\u2019s lottery \n\nscore, a facility will not receive a recommendation for an allocation of Capacity \n\nLimitation if the facility and the application with respect to that facility do not meet the \n\nrequirements of the Final Regulations and this revenue procedure. \n\n        (4) Close of program year.  After the IRS awards all the Capacity Limitation within \n\neach facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, or the 2024 Program year is \n\nclosed, DOE will cease review of any remaining applications.  At the end of the 2024 \n\nProgram year, no further action will be taken on applications submitted but not awarded \n\nan allocation.  DOE will publicly announce on the Program Homepage when the 2024 \n\nProgram year closes.   \n\n     .03 Processing Additional Selection Criteria applications.  \n\n        (1) In general.  Fifty percent of the Capacity Limitation in each facility category will \n\nbe reserved for qualified solar or wind facilities meeting the Ownership Criteria \n\ndescribed in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h)(2) and the Geographic Criteria described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(h)(3).  This reservation will remain beyond the initial 30-day period described in \n\n\n\n-25- \n\nsection 8.02(2) of this revenue procedure.  However, as described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h)(1), \n\nthe Treasury Department and the IRS may later decide to reallocate reserved capacity \n\nacross facility categories and Category 1 sub-reservations in the event one facility \n\ncategory or Category 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed and another has excess \n\ncapacity.  Allocations for facilities meeting one or more of the Additional Selection \n\nCriteria will be made from the 50-percent reserve for such facilities before additional \n\namounts reserved for a facility category are allocated to facilities meeting these criteria.  \n\nIf the 50-percent reserve is depleted, however, applications meeting the Additional \n\nSelection Criteria submitted during the initial 30-day period are prioritized with respect to \n\nall available Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation \n\nas provided in section 8.03(2) of this revenue procedure.   \n\n        (2) Review of Additional Selection Criteria applications.  If a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed at the end of the 30-day period, \n\napplications purporting to meet one or more Additional Selection Criteria are included in \n\nthe lottery (described in section 8.02(3) of this revenue procedure) with non-Additional \n\nSelection Criteria applications for that oversubscribed Category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation.  However, applications purporting to meet one or more Additional Selection \n\nCriteria as a group will be prioritized for an allocation over non-Additional Selection \n\nCriteria applications within the same facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  \n\nDOE will use lottery scores to determine which qualified facilities are eligible for a \n\nrecommendation for an allocation of Capacity Limitation if a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed.  If the eligible applications for Capacity \n\nLimitation for facilities that meet at least one of the two Additional Selection Criteria \n\n\n\n-26- \n\nexceed the Capacity Limitation for a facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, \n\napplications purporting to meet both of the Additional Selection Criteria receive a higher \n\nscore so that they are prioritized over other applications within each facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation.  If upon DOE review it is determined that an application \n\ndoes not meet one or both Additional Selection Criteria purported in the application, \n\nthen the application\u2019s score may be reduced resulting in a change to the application\u2019s \n\npriority status.   \n\n     .04 Cure period for application defects.  \n\n        (1) In general.  If the assigned DOE reviewer identifies a defect with a submitted \n\napplication, such as missing or incorrect information or documentation, DOE will contact \n\nthe applicant via the Portal.  The reviewer will request that the applicant submit \n\nadditional information or documentation to correct or complete the application via the \n\nPortal.  \n\n        (2) Timing for applicant response.  An applicant that is contacted by a DOE \n\nreviewer to submit additional information or documentation or provide corrected \n\ninformation will have 12 business days (12-business day cure period) to respond and \n\nprovide such requested information or documentation. \n\n        (3) Consequences for failure to respond or provide information.  If an applicant fails \n\nto respond and provide the requested information or documentation within the 12 \n\nbusiness-day cure period, DOE will cease review and mark the application as \n\nwithdrawn.   The applicant may create and submit a new application for review, at a \n\nlater date, if the facility remains eligible and the Program is still accepting applications.   \n\nSECTION 9. NOTIFICATION OF ALLOCATION DECISION FROM IRS \n\n\n\n-27- \n\n     .01 In general.  The IRS will send final decision letters through the Portal to inform \n\napplicants of the outcome of the application process.  For any applicant that receives an \n\naward of Capacity Limitation, the letter will state the amount of the allocated Capacity \n\nLimitation.   \n\n     .02 Allocation amount.  The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29- \n\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the \n\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS \n\n     Solely with respect to the 2024 Program year, this revenue procedure supersedes \n\nRev. Proc. 2023-27.   \n\nSECTION 15. APPLICABILITY DATES \n\n     This revenue procedure applies to the 2024 Program year.  \n\nSECTION 16. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT \n\n     This revenue procedure is not creating a new collection of information as described \n\nby the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)).  The collections of information \n\ncontained within this revenue procedure, and their associated burdens, have been \n\n\n\n-31- \n\nsubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget as part of TD 9979 and was \n\napproved under OMB Control Number 1545-2308. \n\nSECTION 17.

            "The criteria for Section 3 properties, in the context of environmental justice programs for solar and wind energy capacity, refer to properties that qualify for allocations under the low-income communities bonus credit program. According to the document, Section 3 criteria pertain to how capacity limitations are allocated and the qualifications for receiving increased energy credits.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Eligibility for Capacity Limitation Allocations**: Facilities must be part of a solar or wind project located in or benefiting specific categories, including low-income communities, Indian lands, or other qualified low-income residential and economic benefit projects.\n\n2. **Specific Categories**:\n   - **Category 1**: Located in a low-income community.\n   - **Category 2**: Located on Indian land.\n   - **Category 3**: Qualified low-income residential building project.\n   - **Category 4**: Qualified low-income economic benefit project.\n\n3. **Sub-Reservations for Residential Facilities**: Within Category 1, there are further subdivisions, such as allocations specifically for behind-the-meter facilities like residential rooftop solar.\n\n4. **Application Requirements**: To apply, owners must submit detailed information about the facility, such as its location, capacity, and contractual agreements, and provide attestations that the project meets the qualifications for the allocated credits.\n\n5. **Additional Selection Criteria**: Some facilities can receive priority if they meet additional criteria, such as being owned by tribal enterprises, renewable energy cooperatives, or tax-exempt organizations, or if located in persistent poverty areas.\n\nIf you are seeking more detailed guidance on specific documentation or processes for applying under Section 3, I can provide further clarification or assistance."

            "Categories 3 and 4 under the low-income communities bonus credit program are defined as specific facility categories that qualify for allocations of environmental justice solar and wind capacity limitations. Here's a more detailed breakdown of each:\n\n### **Category 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project**\nThis category is for solar or wind facilities installed on or serving low-income residential buildings. The focus here is on projects that directly benefit low-income households by providing renewable energy, typically at reduced costs.\n\n- **Eligibility Requirements:**\n  - The facility must be part of a \"qualified low-income residential building project.\" This usually includes multi-family housing units or apartment buildings where a significant portion of the tenants are low-income residents.\n  - There is an emphasis on ensuring that the energy produced directly benefits the residents of these buildings, either by reducing their energy costs or increasing their access to renewable energy resources.\n  \n- **Required Documentation:**\n  - Proof that the property will be installed on a qualified low-income residential building is necessary.\n  - A **Benefits Sharing Statement** is also required, which demonstrates how the financial benefits from the project will be distributed to the low-income residents. This could be in the form of utility bill credits, reductions in electricity rates, or other financial advantages.\n\n### **Category 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project**\nThis category is aimed at solar or wind facilities that provide economic benefits to low-income households in terms of reduced utility costs or other economic advantages. The facilities under this category may serve multiple households or communities, rather than being limited to a specific residential building.\n\n- **Eligibility Requirements:**\n  - At least 50% of the facility\u2019s total kilowatt output must be assigned to qualified low-income households.\n  - The project must offer a minimum **20% bill credit discount rate** for the low-income households. The discount rate is the difference between the financial benefit provided (e.g., utility bill credits or reduced rates) and the cost of participating in the program (e.g., subscription fees for renewable energy).\n  \n- **Required Documentation:**\n  - Similar to Category 3, applicants must provide a list of the low-income households that will benefit from the project, along with the method of income verification used to qualify them.\n  - A spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial benefits to the low-income subscribers, which will show how the 20% bill credit discount rate is achieved.\n\n### **Federal Assistance Requirements**\nFor both Categories 3 and 4, federal assistance requirements focus on ensuring that the projects serve low-income communities and provide tangible economic benefits. This involves:\n\n1. **Low-Income Households**: The households benefiting from the projects must meet certain income thresholds to qualify as \"low-income\" under federal guidelines. This is typically defined by federal poverty guidelines or a percentage of the area's median income.\n   \n2. **Consumer Protection**: Applicants are required to ensure that any low-income households or offtakers receive appropriate consumer disclosures, informing them of their legal rights and protections before they agree to participate in the project.\n\n3. **Documentation for Compliance**: To qualify for these allocations, facilities must provide significant documentation, including contracts, benefits sharing statements, and income verification processes to ensure compliance with federal assistance rules.\n\nIf you need further clarification on specific aspects or additional documentation requirements, feel free to ask!"

For the purposes of Category 4, a \nqualified solar or wind facility is also FTM if 50 percent or more of its electricity generation on an annual \nbasis is physically exported to the broader electricity grid. \n3 As defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i), a qualified wind or solar facility is behind the meter (BTM) if (1) it is \nconnected with an electrical connection between the facility and the panelboard or sub-panelboard of the \nsite where the facility is located, (2) it is to be connected on the customer side of a utility service meter \nbefore it connects to a distribution or transmission system (that is, before it connects to the electricity \ngrid), and its primary purpose is to provide electricity to the utility customer of the site where the facility is \nlocated. This also includes systems not connected to a grid and that may not have a utility service meter, \nand whose primary purpose is to serve the electricity demand of the owner of the site where the system is \nlocated. \n4 If the applicant is not a party named in the contract, the applicant must provide with the applicable \ncontract a statement explaining why the applicant is not named in the contract and the relationship \nbetween the appropriate entity named in the contract and the applicant\u2014the latter of which must be the \nowner of the facility to be eligible to apply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\nDocument Requirement FTM2 BTM3 \n<= 1 MW AC\n# \u30106\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the\n# \u30107\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

The application requires the applicant to provide the information \n\nabout the facility described in section 7.04(2) and 7.04(3) of this revenue procedure. \n\n        (2) Facility maximum net output and nameplate capacity. \n\n           (a) Wind facility.  Applicants seeking an allocation for a wind facility must report \n\n\n\n-9- \n\nthe expected maximum net output of the facility defined as the nameplate capacity of \n\nthe facility in alternating current.  Wind facilities selected for an allocation will be \n\nawarded an amount of Capacity Limitation in direct current that is equal to the facility\u2019s \n\nreported nameplate capacity in alternating current. \n\n           (b) Solar facility.  Applicants seeking an allocation for a solar facility must report \n\nthe expected maximum net output of the facility as measured in alternating current and \n\nthe nameplate capacity of the facility in direct current.  Solar facilities selected for an \n\nallocation will be awarded an amount of Capacity Limitation in direct current that is \n\nequal to the facility\u2019s reported nameplate capacity in direct current. \n\n        (3) Facility location.  Applicants are required to report the location of the facility, \n\nincluding street address (if applicable) and coordinates (latitude and longitude). \n\n     .05 Documentation. \n\n        (1) In general.  Applicants must submit the documentation specified in sections \n\n7.05(2) and 7.05(3) of this revenue procedure with an application for an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation.  An application is not complete and may be rejected if any required \n\ndocumentation is not included. \n\n        (2) Facility documentation.  As specified in Table 2, the following documents are \n\nrequired for each facility for which an application is submitted:    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n-10- \n\nTable 2\n# \u301014\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7. APPLICATION PROCESS \n\n     .01 Registration in general.  Applicants must register in the Portal before they can \n\nbegin the application process.  Potential applicants should follow DOE\u2019s publicly \n\navailable procedures to register in the Portal and to submit applications.  To register, \n\napplicants must first create a login.gov account before accessing the Portal.  After a \n\nlogin.gov account has been created, the user can register as the applicant in the Portal.  \n\nSee the Applicant User Guide, which can be found on the Program Homepage, for more \n\ninformation.  Applications may be submitted only through the Portal.  \n\n     .02 Application Submission.  The applicant must submit their application, including \n\nany required information, documentation, and attestations required by section 7 of this\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29- \n\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nacross facility categories and Category 1 sub-reservations in the event one facility \n\ncategory or Category 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed and another has excess \n\ncapacity.  Allocations for facilities meeting one or more of the Additional Selection \n\nCriteria will be made from the 50-percent reserve for such facilities before additional \n\namounts reserved for a facility category are allocated to facilities meeting these criteria.  \n\nIf the 50-percent reserve is depleted, however, applications meeting the Additional \n\nSelection Criteria submitted during the initial 30-day period are prioritized with respect to \n\nall available Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation \n\nas provided in section 8.03(2) of this revenue procedure.   \n\n        (2) Review of Additional Selection Criteria applications.  If a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed at the end of the 30-day period, \n\napplications purporting to meet one or more Additional Selection Criteria are included in \n\nthe lottery (described in section 8.02(3) of this revenue procedure) with non-Additional \n\nSelection Criteria applications for that oversubscribed Category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation.  However, applications purporting to meet one or more Additional Selection \n\nCriteria as a group will be prioritized for an allocation over non-Additional Selection \n\nCriteria applications within the same facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  \n\nDOE will use lottery scores to determine which qualified facilities are eligible for a \n\nrecommendation for an allocation of Capacity Limitation if a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed.  If the eligible applications for Capacity \n\nLimitation for facilities that meet at least one of the two Additional Selection Criteria \n\n\n\n-26- \n\nexceed the Capacity Limitation for a facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, \n\napplications purporting to meet both of the Additional Selection Criteria receive a higher \n\nscore so that they are prioritized over other applications within each facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation.  If upon DOE review it is determined that an application \n\ndoes not meet one or both Additional Selection Criteria purported in the application, \n\nthen the application\u2019s score may be reduced resulting in a change to the application\u2019s \n\npriority status.   \n\n     .04 Cure period for application defects.  \n\n        (1) In general.  If the assigned DOE reviewer identifies a defect with a submitted \n\napplication, such as missing or incorrect information or documentation, DOE will contact \n\nthe applicant via the Portal.  The reviewer will request that the applicant submit \n\nadditional information or documentation to correct or complete the application via the \n\nPortal.  \n\n        (2) Timing for applicant response.  An applicant that is contacted by a DOE \n\nreviewer to submit additional information or documentation or provide corrected \n\ninformation will have 12 business days (12-business day cure period) to respond and \n\nprovide such requested information or documentation. \n\n        (3) Consequences for failure to respond or provide information.  If an applicant fails \n\nto respond and provide the requested information or documentation within the 12 \n\nbusiness-day cure period, DOE will cease review and mark the application as \n\nwithdrawn.   The applicant may create and submit a new application for review, at a \n\nlater date, if the facility remains eligible and the Program is still accepting applications.   \n\nSECTION 9. NOTIFICATION OF ALLOCATION DECISION FROM IRS \n\n\n\n-27- \n\n     .01 In general.  The IRS will send final decision letters through the Portal to inform \n\napplicants of the outcome of the application process.  For any applicant that receives an\n# \u301017\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nso filed).

Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4.

The application requires the applicant to provide the information \n\nabout the facility described in section 7.04(2) and 7.04(3) of this revenue procedure. \n\n        (2) Facility maximum net output and nameplate capacity. \n\n           (a) Wind facility.  Applicants seeking an allocation for a wind facility must report \n\n\n\n-9- \n\nthe expected maximum net output of the facility defined as the nameplate capacity of \n\nthe facility in alternating current.  Wind facilities selected for an allocation will be \n\nawarded an amount of Capacity Limitation in direct current that is equal to the facility\u2019s \n\nreported nameplate capacity in alternating current. \n\n           (b) Solar facility.  Applicants seeking an allocation for a solar facility must report \n\nthe expected maximum net output of the facility as measured in alternating current and \n\nthe nameplate capacity of the facility in direct current.  Solar facilities selected for an \n\nallocation will be awarded an amount of Capacity Limitation in direct current that is \n\nequal to the facility\u2019s reported nameplate capacity in direct current. \n\n        (3) Facility location.  Applicants are required to report the location of the facility, \n\nincluding street address (if applicable) and coordinates (latitude and longitude). \n\n     .05 Documentation. \n\n        (1) In general.  Applicants must submit the documentation specified in sections \n\n7.05(2) and 7.05(3) of this revenue procedure with an application for an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation.  An application is not complete and may be rejected if any required \n\ndocumentation is not included. \n\n        (2) Facility documentation.  As specified in Table 2, the following documents are \n\nrequired for each facility for which an application is submitted:    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n-10- \n\nTable 2\n# \u301014\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7. APPLICATION PROCESS \n\n     .01 Registration in general.  Applicants must register in the Portal before they can \n\nbegin the application process.  Potential applicants should follow DOE\u2019s publicly \n\navailable procedures to register in the Portal and to submit applications.  To register, \n\napplicants must first create a login.gov account before accessing the Portal.  After a \n\nlogin.gov account has been created, the user can register as the applicant in the Portal.  \n\nSee the Applicant User Guide, which can be found on the Program Homepage, for more \n\ninformation.  Applications may be submitted only through the Portal.  \n\n     .02 Application Submission.  The applicant must submit their application, including \n\nany required information, documentation, and attestations required by section 7 of this\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29- \n\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nacross facility categories and Category 1 sub-reservations in the event one facility \n\ncategory or Category 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed and another has excess \n\ncapacity.  Allocations for facilities meeting one or more of the Additional Selection \n\nCriteria will be made from the 50-percent reserve for such facilities before additional \n\namounts reserved for a facility category are allocated to facilities meeting these criteria.  \n\nIf the 50-percent reserve is depleted, however, applications meeting the Additional \n\nSelection Criteria submitted during the initial 30-day period are prioritized with respect to \n\nall available Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation \n\nas provided in section 8.03(2) of this revenue procedure.   \n\n        (2) Review of Additional Selection Criteria applications.  If a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed at the end of the 30-day period, \n\napplications purporting to meet one or more Additional Selection Criteria are included in \n\nthe lottery (described in section 8.02(3) of this revenue procedure) with non-Additional \n\nSelection Criteria applications for that oversubscribed Category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation.  However, applications purporting to meet one or more Additional Selection \n\nCriteria as a group will be prioritized for an allocation over non-Additional Selection \n\nCriteria applications within the same facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  \n\nDOE will use lottery scores to determine which qualified facilities are eligible for a \n\nrecommendation for an allocation of Capacity Limitation if a facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation is oversubscribed.  If the eligible applications for Capacity \n\nLimitation for facilities that meet at least one of the two Additional Selection Criteria \n\n\n\n-26- \n\nexceed the Capacity Limitation for a facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, \n\napplications purporting to meet both of the Additional Selection Criteria receive a higher \n\nscore so that they are prioritized over other applications within each facility category or \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation.  If upon DOE review it is determined that an application \n\ndoes not meet one or both Additional Selection Criteria purported in the application, \n\nthen the application\u2019s score may be reduced resulting in a change to the application\u2019s \n\npriority status.   \n\n     .04 Cure period for application defects.  \n\n        (1) In general.  If the assigned DOE reviewer identifies a defect with a submitted \n\napplication, such as missing or incorrect information or documentation, DOE will contact \n\nthe applicant via the Portal.  The reviewer will request that the applicant submit \n\nadditional information or documentation to correct or complete the application via the \n\nPortal.  \n\n        (2) Timing for applicant response.  An applicant that is contacted by a DOE \n\nreviewer to submit additional information or documentation or provide corrected \n\ninformation will have 12 business days (12-business day cure period) to respond and \n\nprovide such requested information or documentation. \n\n        (3) Consequences for failure to respond or provide information.  If an applicant fails \n\nto respond and provide the requested information or documentation within the 12 \n\nbusiness-day cure period, DOE will cease review and mark the application as \n\nwithdrawn.   The applicant may create and submit a new application for review, at a \n\nlater date, if the facility remains eligible and the Program is still accepting applications.   \n\nSECTION 9. NOTIFICATION OF ALLOCATION DECISION FROM IRS \n\n\n\n-27- \n\n     .01 In general.  The IRS will send final decision letters through the Portal to inform \n\napplicants of the outcome of the application process.

After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the \n\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29- \n\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n1 \n\nCategory \n\n2 \n\nCategory \n\n3 \n\nCategory \n\n4 \n\nFacility location is eligible.7   Yes Yes No No \n\nI attest that any end-use \n\ncustomer(s)/offtaker(s) of the qualifying facility \n\nhave and/or will receive consumer disclosures \n\ninforming them of their legal rights and \n\nprotections prior to executing a contract to \n\nsubscribe or purchase power from the facility \n\nor lease a facility. \n\nYes Yes Yes Yes \n\n \n7 For Category 1, the applicant must attest that the facility will be located in a low-income community, as \ndefined in the Final Regulations for the Program, specifically \u00a7 1.48(e)-1.

An applicant claiming to be an Alaska Native \n\nCorporation (ANC) must provide a copy of the relevant portions of the ANC\u2019s articles of \n\n\n\n-16- \n\nincorporation and bylaws (and any relevant amendments), including the first page with \n\nthe title of the document and, if applicable, the signature pages.  \n\n        (3) Renewable Energy Cooperative.  An applicant that claims to be a Renewable \n\nEnergy Cooperative, as described under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h)(2)(v), must provide a copy of its \n\narticles of incorporation and bylaws.  The applicant must highlight the relevant language \n\nin these documents that demonstrates the entity meets either the consumer/purchasing \n\ncooperative requirements under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h)(2)(v)(A) or is a worker cooperative \n\ncontrolled by its worker-members with each member having an equal voting right as \n\ndescribed under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h)(2)(v)(B).\n# \u301017\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the \n\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS \n\n     Solely with respect to the 2024 Program year, this revenue procedure supersedes \n\nRev. Proc. 2023-27.   \n\nSECTION 15. APPLICABILITY DATES \n\n     This revenue procedure applies to the 2024 Program year.  \n\nSECTION 16. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT \n\n     This revenue procedure is not creating a new collection of information as described \n\nby the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)).  The collections of information\n# \u301018\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7.

The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the\n# \u30106\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n.04 Facility Information.\n\t(1) In general.

The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u30108\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u30109\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply\n# \u301010\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4.

The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7. APPLICATION PROCESS \n\n     .01 Registration in general.  Applicants must register in the Portal before they can \n\nbegin the application process.  Potential applicants should follow DOE\u2019s publicly \n\navailable procedures to register in the Portal and to submit applications.  To register, \n\napplicants must first create a login.gov account before accessing the Portal.  After a \n\nlogin.gov account has been created, the user can register as the applicant in the Portal.  \n\nSee the Applicant User Guide, which can be found on the Program Homepage, for more \n\ninformation.  Applications may be submitted only through the Portal.  \n\n     .02 Application Submission.  The applicant must submit their application, including \n\nany required information, documentation, and attestations required by section 7 of this\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the \n\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited\n# \u301017\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nDocument Requirement FTM2 BTM3 \n<= 1 MW AC \n\nBTM \n> 1 MW AC \n\nOne of the following documents, in its entirety, \n\ninclusive of any amendments, appendices, \n\nconsumer disclosures, and schedules thereto, \n\nexecuted by each party4 on or before the date of \n\napplication submission: \n\n1) If the applicant will not execute a lease or a \n\npower purchase agreement (PPA) with respect to \n\nthe facility, an executed contract for the installation \n\nof the facility owned by the applicant (for example, \n\nan engineering, procurement, and construction \n\ncontract).  For purposes of meeting this \n\nrequirement, if the applicant will self-install the \n\nfacility, the applicant must submit a contract to \n\npurchase the solar generation or wind generation \n\nequipment; \n\n2) If the applicant will execute a lease with respect \n\nto the facility, an executed contract to lease the \n\nfacility between the applicant (as the lessor) and \n\nNo Yes Yes \n\n\n\n-11- \n\n \n5 If an affidavit is provided, it must be signed by an individual with authority to bind the applicant.   \n\nthe lessee; or  \n\n3) If the applicant will execute a PPA with respect \n\nto the facility, an executed power purchase \n\nagreement for the generation by the facility \n\nbetween the applicant and the offtaker of the \n\nelectricity generated. \n\nA copy of the final, executed interconnection \n\nagreement, if applicable (see below). \n\nIf the facility is located in a market where the \n\ninterconnection agreement cannot be \n\ncountersigned by the interconnecting utility prior to \n\ncompletion of construction or interconnection of the \n\nfacility, the applicant must provide: 1) a copy of the \n\ninterconnection agreement or offer signed by the \n\napplicant (or its agent), 2) a copy of the final \n\ncompleted interconnection screen/study, and 3) \n\neither a conditional approval letter from the \n\ninterconnecting utility or an affidavit5 stating that, \n\nbased on the interconnecting utility\u2019s guidance, the \n\nfacility\u2019s interconnection agreement cannot be \n\ncountersigned by the interconnecting utility and \n\nexecuted until after construction of the facility.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited\n",

The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u30108\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u30109\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.

APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

For \nCategory 2, the applicant must attest that the facility will be located on Indian Land as defined in \n\u00a7 2601(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3501(2)). \n\n\n\n-15- \n\nI attest that at least 50% of the qualifying \n\nfacility\u2019s total kW output will be assigned to \n\nqualified low-income households (defined \n\nunder  \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii)) at a minimum \n\n20% bill credit discount rate, defined as the \n\ndifference between the financial benefit \n\nprovided to a Qualifying Household (including \n\nutility bill credits, reductions in a Qualifying \n\nHousehold\u2019s electricity rate, or other monetary \n\nbenefits accrued by the Qualifying Household \n\non their utility bill) and the cost of participating \n\nin the program (including subscription \n\npayments for renewable energy and any other \n\nfees or charges), expressed as a percentage of\n# \u301014\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3.

The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u30108\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u30109\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.

APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

For \nCategory 2, the applicant must attest that the facility will be located on Indian Land as defined in \n\u00a7 2601(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3501(2)). \n\n\n\n-15- \n\nI attest that at least 50% of the qualifying \n\nfacility\u2019s total kW output will be assigned to \n\nqualified low-income households (defined \n\nunder  \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii)) at a minimum \n\n20% bill credit discount rate, defined as the \n\ndifference between the financial benefit \n\nprovided to a Qualifying Household (including \n\nutility bill credits, reductions in a Qualifying \n\nHousehold\u2019s electricity rate, or other monetary \n\nbenefits accrued by the Qualifying Household \n\non their utility bill) and the cost of participating \n\nin the program (including subscription \n\npayments for renewable energy and any other \n\nfees or charges), expressed as a percentage of\n# \u301014\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited\n# \u301011\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\naward of Capacity Limitation, the letter will state the amount of the allocated Capacity \n\nLimitation.   \n\n     .02 Allocation amount.  The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u301012\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the \n\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS \n\n     Solely with respect to the 2024 Program year, this revenue procedure supersedes \n\nRev. Proc. 2023-27.   \n\nSECTION 15. APPLICABILITY DATES \n\n     This revenue procedure applies to the 2024 Program year.  \n\nSECTION 16. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT \n\n     This revenue procedure is not creating a new collection of information as described \n\nby the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)).  The collections of information\n# \u301013\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nRP-2024-19\n\n\n \n \nPart III \n \n \nAdministrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous \n \n \n \n26 CFR 601.201:  Rulings and determination letters. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRev. Proc. 2024-19 \n \n \nSECTION 1. PURPOSE \n \n     This revenue procedure provides the process under \u00a7 48(e) of the Internal Revenue \n\nCode (Code)1 to apply for an allocation of environmental justice solar and wind capacity \n\nlimitation (Capacity Limitation) as part of the low-income communities bonus credit \n\nprogram (Program) for 2024 (2024 Program year).  Solely with respect to the 2024 \n\nProgram year, this revenue procedure supersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27, 2023-35 I.R.B. \n\n655, and provides important clarifying changes to the application, documentation, and \n\nlottery procedures that apply to the 2024 Program year.  In addition, this revenue \n\nprocedure describes how the Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year will be \n\ndivided across the facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) and 1.48(e)-1(b)(2), \n\n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all \u201csection\u201d or \u201c\u00a7\u201d references are to sections of the Code or the Income Tax \nRegulations (26 CFR part 1). \n\n\n\n-2- \n\nthe Category 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), and the additional \n\nselection criteria application options described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h).  Receipt of an \n\nallocation increases the amount of an energy investment credit determined under \n\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).

On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply\n# \u301017\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nstate and local requirements. \n\nYes Yes Yes \n\nI attest that the proposed location of the facility has \n\nbeen determined suitable for installation. \nYes Yes Yes \n\nI attest that I reasonably believe the qualifying facility \n\nmeets the statutory definition of a single \u201cqualified \nYes Yes Yes \n\n \n6 Non-ministerial permits are permits in which one or more officials or agencies consider various factors \nand exercise some discretion in deciding whether to issue or deny permits.  This does not include \nministerial permits based upon a determination that the request complies with established standards such \nas electrical or building permits.  Non-ministerial permits typically come with conditions and usually \nrequire public notice or hearings.  Examples of non-ministerial permits include local planning board \nauthorization, conditional use permits, variances, and special orders.   \n\n\n\n-14- \n\nsolar and wind facility\u201d ((\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)) and, if \n\napplicable, multiple solar or wind energy properties or \n\nfacilities that are operated as part of a single project \n\n(consistent with the single-project factors provided in \n\nsection 7.01(2)(a) of Notice 2018\u201359, 2018\u201328 I.R.B. \n\n196 or section 4.04(2) of Notice 2013\u201329, 2013\u201320 \n\nI.R.B. 1085) are aggregated and treated as a single \n\nfacility. \n\nI attest that the qualifying facility has not been placed \n\nin service at the time of this submission and will not \n\nbe placed in service prior to being awarded an \n\nallocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\nYes Yes Yes \n\n \n        (3) Facility and category specific attestations.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev.

PURPOSE \n \n     This revenue procedure provides the process under \u00a7 48(e) of the Internal Revenue \n\nCode (Code)1 to apply for an allocation of environmental justice solar and wind capacity \n\nlimitation (Capacity Limitation) as part of the low-income communities bonus credit \n\nprogram (Program) for 2024 (2024 Program year).  Solely with respect to the 2024 \n\nProgram year, this revenue procedure supersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27, 2023-35 I.R.B. \n\n655, and provides important clarifying changes to the application, documentation, and \n\nlottery procedures that apply to the 2024 Program year.  In addition, this revenue \n\nprocedure describes how the Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year will be \n\ndivided across the facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) and 1.48(e)-1(b)(2), \n\n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all \u201csection\u201d or \u201c\u00a7\u201d references are to sections of the Code or the Income Tax \nRegulations (26 CFR part 1). \n\n\n\n-2- \n\nthe Category 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), and the additional \n\nselection criteria application options described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h).  Receipt of an \n\nallocation increases the amount of an energy investment credit determined under \n\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited\n# \u301011\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\naward of Capacity Limitation, the letter will state the amount of the allocated Capacity \n\nLimitation.   \n\n     .02 Allocation amount.  The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u301012\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the \n\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS \n\n     Solely with respect to the 2024 Program year, this revenue procedure supersedes \n\nRev. Proc. 2023-27.   \n\nSECTION 15.

PURPOSE \n \n     This revenue procedure provides the process under \u00a7 48(e) of the Internal Revenue \n\nCode (Code)1 to apply for an allocation of environmental justice solar and wind capacity \n\nlimitation (Capacity Limitation) as part of the low-income communities bonus credit \n\nprogram (Program) for 2024 (2024 Program year).  Solely with respect to the 2024 \n\nProgram year, this revenue procedure supersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27, 2023-35 I.R.B. \n\n655, and provides important clarifying changes to the application, documentation, and \n\nlottery procedures that apply to the 2024 Program year.  In addition, this revenue \n\nprocedure describes how the Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year will be \n\ndivided across the facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) and 1.48(e)-1(b)(2), \n\n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all \u201csection\u201d or \u201c\u00a7\u201d references are to sections of the Code or the Income Tax \nRegulations (26 CFR part 1). \n\n\n\n-2- \n\nthe Category 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), and the additional \n\nselection criteria application options described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(h).  Receipt of an \n\nallocation increases the amount of an energy investment credit determined under \n\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2.

On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register\n# \u301014\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.

Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3.

Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.

The application must include the following attestations for the applicable facility category:\n# \u30105\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29- \n\ndocumentation at placed in service is authorized to legally bind the owner, and that, \n\nunder penalties of perjury, they have examined the submission, including any \n\naccompanying documents, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, all of the \n\nfacts contained therein are true, correct, and complete.   \n\nSECTION 11. EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the\n# \u30106\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n.04 Facility Information.\n\t(1) In general.

The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u30108\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u30109\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply\n# \u301010\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4.

The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7. APPLICATION PROCESS \n\n     .01 Registration in general.  Applicants must register in the Portal before they can \n\nbegin the application process.  Potential applicants should follow DOE\u2019s publicly \n\navailable procedures to register in the Portal and to submit applications.  To register, \n\napplicants must first create a login.gov account before accessing the Portal.  After a \n\nlogin.gov account has been created, the user can register as the applicant in the Portal.  \n\nSee the Applicant User Guide, which can be found on the Program Homepage, for more \n\ninformation.  Applications may be submitted only through the Portal.  \n\n     .02 Application Submission.  The applicant must submit their application, including \n\nany required information, documentation, and attestations required by section 7 of this\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the \n\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited\n# \u301017\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nDocument Requirement FTM2 BTM3 \n<= 1 MW AC \n\nBTM \n> 1 MW AC \n\nOne of the following documents, in its entirety, \n\ninclusive of any amendments, appendices, \n\nconsumer disclosures, and schedules thereto, \n\nexecuted by each party4 on or before the date of \n\napplication submission: \n\n1) If the applicant will not execute a lease or a \n\npower purchase agreement (PPA) with respect to \n\nthe facility, an executed contract for the installation \n\nof the facility owned by the applicant (for example, \n\nan engineering, procurement, and construction \n\ncontract).  For purposes of meeting this \n\nrequirement, if the applicant will self-install the \n\nfacility, the applicant must submit a contract to \n\npurchase the solar generation or wind generation \n\nequipment; \n\n2) If the applicant will execute a lease with respect \n\nto the facility, an executed contract to lease the \n\nfacility between the applicant (as the lessor) and \n\nNo Yes Yes \n\n\n\n-11- \n\n \n5 If an affidavit is provided, it must be signed by an individual with authority to bind the applicant.   \n\nthe lessee; or  \n\n3) If the applicant will execute a PPA with respect \n\nto the facility, an executed power purchase \n\nagreement for the generation by the facility \n\nbetween the applicant and the offtaker of the \n\nelectricity generated. \n\nA copy of the final, executed interconnection \n\nagreement, if applicable (see below). \n\nIf the facility is located in a market where the \n\ninterconnection agreement cannot be \n\ncountersigned by the interconnecting utility prior to \n\ncompletion of construction or interconnection of the \n\nfacility, the applicant must provide: 1) a copy of the \n\ninterconnection agreement or offer signed by the \n\napplicant (or its agent), 2) a copy of the final \n\ncompleted interconnection screen/study, and 3) \n\neither a conditional approval letter from the \n\ninterconnecting utility or an affidavit5 stating that, \n\nbased on the interconnecting utility\u2019s guidance, the \n\nfacility\u2019s interconnection agreement cannot be \n\ncountersigned by the interconnecting utility and \n\nexecuted until after construction of the facility.

The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u30108\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u30109\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply\n# \u301010\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4.

As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the \n\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.

BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3.

EFFECT OF ALLOCATION OR OTHER NOTIFICATION \n\n     A Capacity Limitation allocation or a notification that a facility has met the eligibility \n\nrequirements under the Program at the time the facility is placed in service is not a final \n\ndetermination that property is eligible for an increased credit under \u00a7 48(e).  The IRS \n\nmay, upon examination, determine that property does not qualify for the increased \n\ncredit. \n\nSECTION 12. CLAIMING THE ENERGY PERCENTAGE INCREASE \n\n     .01 In general.  After the facility is placed in service, and the owner submits the \n\nadditional documentation and attestations described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k) and section 10 of \n\nthis revenue procedure, the owner is notified that it (or the applicable partners or \n\nshareholders in the case of a partnership or an S corporation) may claim the energy \n\npercentage increase on Form 3468, Investment Credit (or successor form) or Form \n\n3800, General Business Credit (or successor form), if eligible, make an elective \n\npayment election under \u00a7 6417, or, if eligible, make a transfer election under \u00a7 6418.  \n\n     .02 Reduction in Increased Energy Percentage.  In cases where the facility size is \n\nlarger than the allocated capacity when placed in service (but still below 5 MW AC), the \n\n10 percentage or 20 percentage point increase will be reduced by a reduction factor \n\nwhich is calculated by the amount of Capacity Limitation allocated (kW) divided by the\n# \u30106\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n.04 Facility Information.\n\t(1) In general.

The Capacity Limitation allocated to a facility will be \n\ndetermined based on the nameplate capacity of the facility as stated in the application.  \n\nThe Capacity Limitation allocation will be provided in direct current.  For wind facilities, \n\nalternating current will be treated as equivalent to direct current for purposes of \n\ndetermining the amount of a Capacity Limitation allocation.  The facility that receives the \n\nfinal allocation of Capacity Limitation in each facility category or Category 1 sub-\n\nreservation may receive an allocation less than its nameplate capacity.   \n\nSECTION 10. PLACED IN SERVICE \n\n     .01 In general.  To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), for any facility that \n\nreceives an allocation of Capacity Limitation, the owner of the facility must report to \n\nDOE through the Portal the date the facility was placed in service.   \n\n     .02 Documentation and attestation requirements.  To satisfy the requirements of \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(k), the owner must provide the following through the Portal:   \n\n        (1) A Permission to Operate (PTO) letter (or commissioning report for off-grid \n\nfacilities) confirming that the facility has been placed in service and the location of the \n\nfacility being placed in service; \n\n        (2) A Final, Professional Engineer (PE) stamped (if required by applicable state or \n\nlocal law) as-built design plan, PTO letter with nameplate capacity listed, or other \n\ndocumentation from an unrelated party verifying as-built nameplate capacity;  \n\n\n\n-28- \n\n        (3) For Category 3 Facilities, a Benefits Sharing Statement as defined in \u00a7 1.48(e)-\n\n1(e)(6) demonstrating that the financial benefits requirements will be met based on the \n\nexpected annual energy produced by the as-built facility at placed in service;  \n\n        (4) For Category 4 Facilities, a final list of low-income households served with \n\nname, address, subscription share, and the income verification method used. \n\nAlternatively, if financial benefits are delivered through a utility or government body \n\nwhere the utility or government body cannot provide a final list of low-income \n\nhouseholds served with all relevant details, documentation issued from the participating \n\nutility or government body (for example, a Public Utility Commission, state energy office, \n\nor Tribal government) or the program administrator acting on behalf of the utility or \n\ngovernment body that confirms that the facility is participating in a low-income program \n\nthat ensures that at least fifty percent of the facility's total output is assigned to \n\nqualifying low-income households under \u00a7 48(e)(2)(C)(i) or (ii) (Qualifying Household).  \n\nIf documentation is submitted from the participating utility, government body, or program \n\nadministrator, the documentation must also include additional information, such as a \n\ncopy of the relevant statute or regulatory order, that confirms that the low-income \n\nprogram in which the facility is participating requires the facility to serve multiple \n\nQualifying Households; and   \n\n        (5) For Category 4 Facilities, a spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial \n\nbenefit to low-income subscribers to demonstrate the 20 percent bill credit discount rate.  \n\n        (6) An attestation confirming that a disqualification event under \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(1) \n\nthrough (5) has not occurred.   \n\n        (7) An attestation stating that the person submitting the information and \n\n\n\n-29-\n# \u30108\u2020DC Affordable Properties 05 29 19 (2).pdf\u2020file-Ynq0eUyhVQZz3bI1PrOgYovF\u3011\nLIHTC Database Access\n# \u30109\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM \n\nor other facilities located in low-income communities).  In addition, applicants must \n\nselect the appropriate application option (for example, additional selection criteria, if \n\napplicable) within the facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation to which they are \n\napplying.  DOE will not move applications to a different facility category or Category 1 \n\nsub-reservation.     \n\n     .03 One application for the 2024 Program year.  Applicants may only submit one \n\napplication per facility for the 2024 Program year.  If, after submitting an application for \n\na facility, the applicant decides that it would rather have the facility considered for an \n\nallocation under a different facility category or Category 1 sub-reservation, the applicant \n\n\n\n-6- \n\nmust withdraw the first application and submit a second application under the other \n\nfacility category or Category 1 sub-reservation.  If DOE identifies that an applicant has \n\nsubmitted more than one application for a facility (and the applicant has not withdrawn \n\npreviously submitted application(s)), any application submitted after the first submitted \n\napplication will be considered a duplicate application and will be treated as withdrawn. \n\n     .04 Opening and closing dates of 2024 Program year application period.  The \n\nTreasury Department and the IRS will publicly announce the opening and closing dates \n\nfor the 2024 Program year application period on DOE\u2019s landing page for the Program \n\n(Program Homepage), available at https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-\n\ncommunities-bonus-credit-program.  DOE will not accept new application submissions \n\nfor the 2024 Program year after 11:59 PM ET on the date the application period closes.  \n\nSECTION 6. APPLICANT \n\n     .01 In general.  The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply\n# \u301010\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\ntotal nameplate capacity installed (kW) at the time the owner of the facility claims the \n\n\n\n-30- \n\nenergy percentage increase under \u00a7 48(e).  See \u00a7 48(e)(1)(B). \n\nSECTION 13. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST \n\n     .01 In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 13, a Capacity Limitation \n\nallocation award applies only to the taxpayer who applied for and received an allocation \n\naward for the facility the taxpayer owns.  If a taxpayer wants to request a transfer of an \n\nallocation, it should refer to DOE\u2019s publicly available written procedures to initiate a \n\ntransfer request in the Portal.  Transfer requests will be reviewed and approved by the \n\nIRS.  The IRS intends to provide future guidance regarding unincorporated \n\norganizations that elect to be excluded from the application of subchapter K.   \n\n     .02 Additional Selection Criteria.  Applicants who received an allocation based on the \n\nAdditional Selection Criteria should refer to \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) regarding potential \n\ndisqualification if the original applicant does not retain the requisite interest described in \n\n\u00a7 1.48(e)-1(m)(5) in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes \n\nthat owns the facility. \n\nSECTION 14.

On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited \n\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4.

The owner of the solar or wind facility is the person who must apply \n\nfor an allocation of Capacity Limitation.  If the facility is determined to be eligible for an \n\nallocation, and there is Capacity Limitation available to allocate, the owner of the facility \n\nis the recipient of the allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Disregarded entities.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by an entity that \n\nis disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, the owner of \n\nthe disregarded entity is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  \n\n     .03 Partnerships and S corporations.  If a qualified solar or wind facility is owned by a \n\npartnership or S corporation, then the partnership or S corporation, and not its partners \n\nor shareholders, is the owner of the facility and is the applicant.  For unincorporated \n\norganizations that have made or will make an election under \u00a7 761(a) to be excluded \n\n\n\n-7- \n\nfrom the application of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter k), the \n\norganization, and not its members, is the applicant.  \n\nSECTION 7. APPLICATION PROCESS \n\n     .01 Registration in general.  Applicants must register in the Portal before they can \n\nbegin the application process.  Potential applicants should follow DOE\u2019s publicly \n\navailable procedures to register in the Portal and to submit applications.  To register, \n\napplicants must first create a login.gov account before accessing the Portal.  After a \n\nlogin.gov account has been created, the user can register as the applicant in the Portal.  \n\nSee the Applicant User Guide, which can be found on the Program Homepage, for more \n\ninformation.  Applications may be submitted only through the Portal.  \n\n     .02 Application Submission.  The applicant must submit their application, including \n\nany required information, documentation, and attestations required by section 7 of this\n# \u301015\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nto the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current capacity plus any \n\nunallocated Capacity Limitation carried over from the 2023 Program year.  If any such \n\nCapacity Limitation from the 2023 Program year is carried over to the 2024 Program \n\nyear, the Treasury Department and the IRS will announce the distribution of that \n\n\n\n-4- \n\nCapacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the annual Capacity Limitation available for \n\nallocation is divided across the four facility categories described in \u00a7\u00a7 48(e)(2)(A)(iii) \n\nand 1.48(e)-1(b)(2).  For the 2024 Program year, the Treasury Department and the IRS \n\nplan to distribute the annual Capacity Limitation of 1.8 gigawatts of direct current \n\ncapacity as shown in Table 1.  As described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(g), the Treasury Department \n\nand the IRS may later reallocate Capacity Limitation across facility categories in the \n\nevent any category is oversubscribed or has excess capacity.   \n\nTable 1 \n\nCategories Megawatts \n\nCategory 1: Located in a Low-Income Community  \n\nCategory 2: Located on Indian Land  \n\nCategory 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project  \n\nCategory 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project  \n\n600 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n200 megawatts \n\n800 megawatts \n\n \n\nSECTION 4. CATEGORY 1 SUB-RESERVATIONS \n\n     As provided in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(1), Category 1 Capacity Limitation is subdivided for \n\neach Program year, with a specific sub-reservation for eligible residential behind the \n\nmeter (BTM) facilities.  Accordingly, the 600 megawatts of Capacity Limitation for \n\nCategory 1 facilities will be subdivided for facilities seeking a Category 1 allocation with \n\n400 megawatts of Capacity Limitation reserved specifically for eligible residential BTM \n\nfacilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(ii), including rooftop solar.  The remaining 200 \n\nmegawatts of Capacity Limitation distributed to Category 1 is available for applicants \n\n\n\n-5- \n\nwith front of the meter (FTM) facilities described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(iii) as well as non-\n\nresidential BTM facilities that meet the requirements of \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i)(2)(i).   \n\nSECTION 5. APPLICATION \n\n     .01 In general. An applicant (described in section 6 of this revenue procedure) must \n\napply for an allocation of Capacity Limitation through Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) \n\nonline Program portal system (Portal), available at https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/.  \n\nThe application must contain all information, documentation, and attestations specified \n\nin section 7 of this revenue procedure and any additional information required by DOE\u2019s \n\npublicly available written procedures.   \n\n     .02 Selection of the appropriate category or sub-reservation.  Applicants must submit \n\napplications for a particular facility category described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(b)(2) (that is, \n\nCategory 1 Facility, Category 2 Facility, Category 3 Facility, or Category 4 Facility).  If \n\nthe applicant is applying in Category 1, the applicant must also select the appropriate \n\nCategory 1 sub-reservation described in \u00a7 1.48(e)-1(i) (that is, eligible residential BTM\n# \u301016\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\n\u00a7 48(a) (\u00a7 48 credit) for the taxable year in which certain solar and wind-powered \n\nelectricity generation facilities are placed in service. \n\nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n\n     .01 Section 13103 of Public Law 117\u2013169, 136 Stat. 1818, 1921 (August 16, 2022), \n\ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added new \u00a7 48(e) to the \n\nCode.  Section 48(e) increases the amount of the \u00a7 48 credit with respect to eligible \n\nproperty that is part of a qualified solar or wind facility that is awarded an allocation of \n\nCapacity Limitation as part of the Program.  The \u00a7 48 credit for a taxable year is \n\ngenerally calculated by multiplying the basis of each energy property placed in service \n\nduring that taxable year by the energy percentage (as defined in \u00a7 48(a)(2)).  Section \n\n48(e) increases the \u00a7 48 credit by increasing the energy percentage used to calculate \n\nthe amount of the \u00a7 48 credit (\u00a7 48(e) Increase) in the case of qualified solar and wind \n\nfacilities that receive an allocation of Capacity Limitation. \n\n     .02 Section 48(e)(4) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate to \n\nestablish a program, within 180 days of enactment of the IRA, to allocate amounts of \n\nCapacity Limitation to qualified solar and wind facilities.  Notice 2023\u201317, 2023\u201310 \n\nI.R.B. 505, established the Program and provided definitions and other guidance related \n\nto the Program.  On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury \n\nDepartment) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published in the Federal Register \n\n(88 FR 35791) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-110412-23, 2023-26 I.R.B. 1098) \n\n\n\n-3- \n\nunder \u00a7 48(e) (Proposed Rules) relating to the Program.  On August 15, 2023, Treasury \n\nDecision 9979 was published in the Federal Register (88 FR 55506) to adopt the \n\nProposed Rules with modifications as final regulations codified at \u00a7 1.48(e)-1 (Final \n\nRegulations).   \n\n     .03 On August 28, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published Rev. Proc. \n\n2023-27, which provided guidance necessary to implement the Program for 2023 (2023 \n\nProgram year), including the information an applicant must submit to apply for a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation, the application review process, the manner of obtaining a \n\nCapacity Limitation allocation from the IRS, and the procedures and documentation \n\nrequirements for reporting that a facility was placed in service.  This revenue procedure \n\nsupersedes Rev. Proc. 2023-27 solely with respect to the 2024 Program year and \n\nprovides guidance necessary to implement the Program for the 2024 Program year.  \n\nThe procedures for the 2024 Program year provided in this revenue procedure generally \n\nfollow those provided in Rev. Proc. 2023-27 with certain clarifying changes to the \n\napplication and documentation requirements described in more detail in sections 3 \n\nthrough 13 of this revenue procedure.   \n\nSECTION 3. CAPACITY LIMITATION AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION \n\n     .01 The amount of Capacity Limitation for the 2024 Program year available for \n\nallocation through the application process provided in this revenue procedure is limited\n# \u301017\u2020rp-24-19.pdf\u2020file-SWWaLlEzc5nakmn1GJbC2DNW\u3011\nDocument Requirement FTM2 BTM3 \n<= 1 MW AC \n\nBTM \n> 1 MW AC \n\nOne of the following documents, in its entirety, \n\ninclusive of any amendments, appendices, \n\nconsumer disclosures, and schedules thereto, \n\nexecuted by each party4 on or before the date of \n\napplication submission: \n\n1) If the applicant will not execute a lease or a \n\npower purchase agreement (PPA) with respect to \n\nthe facility, an executed contract for the installation \n\nof the facility owned by the applicant (for example, \n\nan engineering, procurement, and construction \n\ncontract).  For purposes of meeting this \n\nrequirement, if the applicant will self-install the \n\nfacility, the applicant must submit a contract to \n\npurchase the solar generation or wind generation \n\nequipment; \n\n2) If the applicant will execute a lease with respect \n\nto the facility, an executed contract to lease the \n\nfacility between the applicant (as the lessor) and \n\nNo Yes Yes \n\n\n\n-11- \n\n \n5 If an affidavit is provided, it must be signed by an individual with authority to bind the applicant.   \n\nthe lessee; or  \n\n3) If the applicant will execute a PPA with respect \n\nto the facility, an executed power purchase \n\nagreement for the generation by the facility \n\nbetween the applicant and the offtaker of the \n\nelectricity generated. \n\nA copy of the final, executed interconnection \n\nagreement, if applicable (see below). \n\nIf the facility is located in a market where the \n\ninterconnection agreement cannot be \n\ncountersigned by the interconnecting utility prior to \n\ncompletion of construction or interconnection of the \n\nfacility, the applicant must provide: 1) a copy of the \n\ninterconnection agreement or offer signed by the \n\napplicant (or its agent), 2) a copy of the final \n\ncompleted interconnection screen/study, and 3) \n\neither a conditional approval letter from the \n\ninterconnecting utility or an affidavit5 stating that, \n\nbased on the interconnecting utility\u2019s guidance, the \n\nfacility\u2019s interconnection agreement cannot be \n\ncountersigned by the interconnecting utility and \n\nexecuted until after construction of the facility.
