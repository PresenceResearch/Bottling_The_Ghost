There isn't a single app dedicated exclusively to BBC Essential Mixes, but there are a few options that might allow you to stream or access the mixes:

1. **BBC Sounds App**: This is the official app from the BBC where you can find a variety of shows, mixes, and music content, including the **Essential Mix**. You can listen to the most recent mixes here, although the full archive may not be available.
   
2. **SoundCloud**: Many artists and fans upload BBC Essential Mixes to SoundCloud. You can search for individual mixes or follow accounts that upload these regularly.

3. **Mixcloud**: Similar to SoundCloud, Mixcloud hosts a variety of user-uploaded mixes, including the Essential Mix. Some DJs also have official uploads of their Essential Mixes here.

4. **Spotify/Apple Music**: While the Essential Mixes themselves aren’t officially available, you can often find playlists created by fans that include many of the tracks featured in those mixes.

Would any of these options suit your needs?
