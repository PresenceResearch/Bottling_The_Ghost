please input this data into a google sheet. What would be the impact on internal resources, such as onsite visits and time spent on permits?-
System size
interconnection type- Line side or back fed breaker
# of interconnections
Net or CREF ( dont need to go inside)
size of building (floors) how we run conduit. space of gear etc..
Surveys typically take on site time of 1-4hrs electric only.
filing for permits typically takes 1-2hrs
How much time would Don, MK, and Joe Merritt need to commit to this project after the survey phase?
1.5 hours to get the IX application and documents put together alongside entering it in their portal

1.5 hours to get the permit applied for and documents put together to submit whether in their portal or to send off

2-3 hours of working with the AHJ and Utility on approval and to get the project pushed through
But this fluctuates a lot based on whether or not there are additional engineering changes required by the AHJ/Pepco, etc.

3 hours per week per project depending on what is needed. Engineering tasks, COs, customer communications.

 Elec review deep dive 5-10hrs once plans are back depending on system size/complexity

BOS/Gear spec- 5-20 hrs to compile and send request.

Is it feasible to use the Energy Services price list, and could we apply Time & Materials (T&M) billing to control costs?-
 
I would charge $150/hr for survey and possible come up with an average admin time based on the $150/hr
What metrics should be used to price this work? Should we consider $/Watt, a tiered approach by project size, or a punchlist model similar to DealHub?
So many different variables, for instance Pompian took 1hr to survey IKO took 3.  Depending on the interconnection that changes on what you look for and ignore.

I think it best to have a set cost based on average hours required to perform the services asked.

Operations:
"What makes this a viable project?"- How clean is it, do we have mob day figured out, do we have an interconnection plan, do we need a work with, do we have subs working on certain parts of the job. Is the customer accommodating or is everything an ask.
-physicality of building the project- How straightforward is it, CREF vs NEM, How structurally sound is the roof, multiple loading zones, break up the load. What is access to the roof and point of interconnection? 
-flush out all the risk- Know before we go, have all the bumps in the road sorted and known.  Added cost and obstacles, reach out to 3rd parties for cost and or procedures early. .
-how much confidence do we have in our final budget-Jump on quotes and planning much earlier, which helps the budget and or CO request.

User is evaluating the impact of internal resources, including onsite visits and time spent on permits, for solar projects. They are analyzing the time commitment needed for survey, interconnection application, permit filing, utility and AHJ approval, and project management from Don, MK, and Joe Merritt. They are considering pricing models, including $/Watt, tiered approaches, and punchlist models, and are discussing Time & Materials billing at $150/hour. They also want to understand how to evaluate the feasibility and risk of projects, such as interconnection plans, structural soundness, customer accommodation, and planning ahead for added costs and obstacles.

To help with inputting this data into a Google Sheet, I suggest organizing the information into sections such as:

1. **System Details and Onsite Time**  
   - System Size  
   - Interconnection Type  
   - Number of Interconnections  
   - Net or CREF  
   - Building Size (floors)  
   - Time Spent on Survey  
   - Permit Filing Time  

2. **Team Commitment After Survey**  
   - Time for IX Application (1.5 hours)  
   - Time for Permit Application (1.5 hours)  
   - Time Working with AHJ and Utility (2-3 hours)  
   - Weekly Time Commitment per Project (3 hours/week)  
   - Electrical Review Time (5-10 hours)  
   - BOS/Gear Spec Compilation (5-20 hours)  

3. **Pricing Considerations**  
   - Survey Charge ($150/hour)  
   - Admin Time Estimate  
   - Possible Pricing Models ($/Watt, tiered, punchlist)  
   - Use of Time & Materials Billing  

4. **Operations Feasibility and Risk**  
   - Viability of Project (cleanliness, interconnection plan, customer accommodation)  
   - Physicality of Building the Project (CREF vs NEM, roof soundness, access)  
   - Risk Evaluation (obstacles, third-party costs, procedures)  
   - Confidence in Final Budget (early quotes, planning)

I can provide a template or help you structure this further based on your needs. Would you like me to create this in a downloadable format or guide you step-by-step to set it up?
