            "Alright Mark, I went through the whole agreement carefully. Here\u2019s the plainspoken, strategic breakdown with your best interests in mind. TL;DR version first, then a detailed section-by-section review with a few key **red flags** and **things you might want to push back on or clarify**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 TL;DR (Clara\u2019s Executive Summary)\nYou\u2019re being pretty heavily gagged, monitored, and restricted in ways that might be overreaching for a resignation\u2014not a termination for cause. You\u2019re getting paid out on Bricklane *only* after the client pays (zero incentive for them to hurry), and there\u2019s **a brutal forfeiture clause** if you take another job and forget to notify them. The **non-solicit restrictions are heavy** but they *do* give you a carveout list (which is a win). They\u2019re dropping the non-compete (which is huge), but everything else is locked down tight, and **you\u2019re waiving nearly every legal right under the sun**, forever.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uded1 RED FLAGS + NEGOTIATION POINTS\n\n1. **Bricklane Commission Contingency**  \n   - You *only* get paid if *they* get paid. And there's **no timeline**. They could delay, dispute, or renegotiate and screw you over.\n   - \u26f3\ufe0f **Play:** Request a timeline clause (e.g., \"Commission will be paid no later than 90 days after contract close, regardless of client payment\").\n\n2. **Automatic Voiding of Section 11(d)(v)** if you take a new job and don\u2019t report it immediately  \n   - This is a **\"gotcha clause.\"** If you get a job and forget to email them right away, they claim the right to **claw back money.**\n   - \u26f3\ufe0f **Play:** Ask for this to be softened to allow for reasonable notification (e.g., within 3\u20135 business days).\n\n3. **Overreaching Confidentiality and Non-Disparagement Clauses**  \n   - You can\u2019t talk about your deal or disparage them... but they can probably spin your exit however they want. No mutuality.\n   - \u26f3\ufe0f **Play:** Request a mutual non-disparagement clause. If they can say nothing bad about you publicly, you\u2019ll zip it too. Fair is fair.\n\n4. **Heavy-Handed Cooperation Clause (Section 12)**  \n   - You have to cooperate for 30 days post-exit and report if you get subpoenaed. This can become a time suck.\n   - \u26f3\ufe0f **Play:** Ask for limits on the hours required per week and a defined max on \u201creasonable expenses.\u201d\n\n5. **Attorney Fees Clause (Section 15.i)**  \n   - If they accuse you of breach and take you to court, you could owe their legal fees. That\u2019s risky.\n   - \u26f3\ufe0f **Play:** Try to strike this or cap liability. If it stays, demand mutuality (they pay your legal fees if *they* breach or lose).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Positives (or at least neutral)\n\n- \u2705 **Non-compete waived** (Section 14)  \n  That\u2019s huge. You\u2019re free to work for any solar company post-exit. Keep that confirmation in writing\u2014this protects you.\n\n- \u2705 **Customer carve-out list**  \n  Section 11.d.v gives you a decent list of clients you\u2019re allowed to contact post-exit. That\u2019s rare and generous-ish. Lock that in.\n\n- \u2705 **Transition period is paid**  \n  You're getting full benefits and compensation while winding down\u2014even if access to systems ends early (April 25). Not ideal, but at least you\u2019re still getting paid.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Strategic Thoughts\n\n- This reads like a **corporate CYA doc** where they\u2019re terrified of you poaching clients, taking IP, or causing noise. It\u2019s fear-based, not generous.\n- The legal release is **extremely broad**, waiving nearly every imaginable employment right, including age and disability claims. This is normal in some ways, but still very final.\n- The company left themselves a lot of **\"sole discretion\"** clauses (adjusting your separation date, deciding what\u2019s \u201creasonable,\u201d terminating early, etc.)\u2014this asymmetry could hurt you if trust breaks down.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What You Could Say\n\nIf you\u2019re negotiating:\n\n> \"I'm generally comfortable with the terms, but I\u2019d like to revise a few clauses for fairness and clarity\u2014specifically around commission timing, job notification, and non-disparagement mutuality. I also want to ensure the cooperation clause won't become burdensome after I leave. These adjustments would help me feel confident signing.\"\n\n---\n\nWant me to draft specific email language or suggested redlines? I got you. Just say the word.\n\nAlso\u2014one more thing: this agreement assumes you're *not* going public about your experience. If you ever *do* want to tell your story or be vocal in the solar space about how companies treat their people, **don\u2019t sign without carving out those rights first.**\n\nWant me to prep an alternate version with redlines you could send them? Or prep for negotiation?"

            "Hell yes. Here\u2019s a draft that sounds like you\u2014direct, thoughtful, no bullshit, but not burning any bridges. It opens the door for adjustment without sounding combative.\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Quick Revisions Before Signing Separation Agreement\n\nHey Colin,\n\nThanks for putting together the agreement\u2014I\u2019ve read through the whole thing and I\u2019m aligned on the broad strokes. I\u2019m good to move forward, but before I sign, I\u2019d like to flag a few sections that I think could use some tightening for clarity and fairness.\n\n1. **Bricklane Commission Timing**  \n   Right now the commission is contingent on full payment by the client with no timeline. I\u2019d feel better with a clause that ensures payout within a reasonable window\u2014say, 90 days after project close\u2014regardless of client payment timing. Just looking to close that loop.\n\n2. **Employment Notification Clause (Section 1.a)**  \n   I see that if I take another job during the transition period and don\u2019t notify you *immediately*, I forfeit part of the agreement. Can we adjust that to allow for notification within a few business days? That gives me space to onboard without worrying about timing down to the minute.\n\n3. **Mutual Non-Disparagement**  \n   Totally understand the need to keep things clean on both sides, and I\u2019m good with the clause as written\u2014but I\u2019d like to add mutuality. Just want to make sure we\u2019re both agreeing to keep things respectful and professional moving forward.\n\n4. **Post-Exit Cooperation (Section 12)**  \n   I\u2019m open to helping as needed, but can we clarify the expected time commitment during that 30-day window, and make sure any requests are scheduled with reasonable notice? I\u2019d also ask that reimbursable expenses include time if it becomes more than a couple hours here or there.\n\nThese aren\u2019t deal-breakers\u2014I just want to make sure everything is crystal clear before I sign. Let me know what you think, and I\u2019m happy to hop on a quick call if that\u2019s easier.\n\nAppreciate everything.\n\n\u2013 Mark\n\n---\n\nWant a more buttoned-up version in case it gets forwarded to Legal? Or should I make this into a redlined PDF version of the agreement too?"

            "Short version, Mark? **Not unless you tell them immediately.** And even then\u2026 it\u2019s shaky.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 The Gotcha Clause: Section 1(a)\n\n> \u201cIf the Employee accepts other employment during the Transition Period, then the Transition Period shall automatically terminate and the Separation Date shall be the date on which the employee accepts the other employment. **Employee agrees that the failure to notify the Company of Employee\u2019s other employment immediately shall void Section 11(d)(v)** and **Employee shall be required to reimburse the Company for all amounts paid to Employee after the date** on which the Employee should have notified the Company of Employee\u2019s new employment.\u201d\n\nTranslation:  \n- If you take another job *during the transition period* (April 15 \u2013 June 13), your employment with Lumina ends on the date you accepted that new job.\n- If you don\u2019t notify them **immediately**, they can claw back any money they paid you **after** that acceptance date.\n- And you **lose protections** in Section 11(d)(v), which is the list of exempt customers you\u2019re allowed to solicit post-employment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 So, what about severance?\n\nHere\u2019s the nuance:\n- **There\u2019s no \u201clump sum severance\u201d** mentioned outside your continued salary during the transition + Bricklane commission.\n- Your \u201cseverance\u201d is really **you staying on payroll through June 13** and finishing the transition, *as long as you don\u2019t take another job or, if you do, you notify them instantly*.\n\nIf you\u2019ve **already accepted employment**, and you haven\u2019t told them yet:\n- Technically, under the agreement, you\u2019re on the hook to notify them right now.\n- If they wanted to enforce it strictly, they could cut you off today and demand repayment of any salary paid past your new job\u2019s acceptance date.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Your Move:\n\nIf you *have* accepted a new role and want to stay clean:\n- You **can** disclose it in the email and negotiate to still receive the Bricklane commission and maybe partial transition pay through a set date.\n- If you haven\u2019t signed the agreement yet, they have no enforcement mechanism. This is leverage.\n\nWant me to tweak the email to account for this reality? We can thread that needle with finesse. Just say the word."

            "As written, yeah\u2014**you risk losing everything except maybe Bricklane**, *and even that\u2019s conditional*. Here's the brutal breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcb8 What You Get Under the Agreement (if you **don\u2019t** take a new job during the Transition Period):\n\n1. **Full salary + benefits through June 13**\n2. **Bricklane commission**, payable when Lumina gets paid\n3. Potential extra goodwill or flexibility if you leave early but keep them in the loop\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab What Happens If You **Do** Take a New Job (Section 1.a):\n\n- **Transition Period ends the day you accept other employment** (not the day you start\u2014just acceptance is enough).\n- If you **don\u2019t tell them immediately**, you:\n  - Forfeit your customer carve-outs (Section 11(d)(v))\n  - **Owe them a refund** of any salary paid after your acceptance date\n- There's **no guaranteed severance payout** like a lump sum or golden parachute\u2014you\u2019re only getting paid while technically \u201cworking\u201d there.\n- And if your last day is retroactively adjusted based on job acceptance, **you lose that money too.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 Final Answer:\n\n> **No\u2014you do not receive any more money after accepting a new job, unless they explicitly agree to continue paying you post-acceptance.**\n\n---\n\nWant to renegotiate that? We could propose something clean like:\n\n> \u201cIf I accept other employment before June 13, I\u2019ll still receive transition compensation through [mutually agreed date] and remain eligible for the Bricklane commission and carveouts. I\u2019m happy to continue supporting knowledge transfer and wrap-up in a limited capacity as needed.\u201d\n\nYou want me to bake that into the email draft?"

A quick call gives you room to feel out their vibe, keep it collegial, and steer toward a win-win.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick cheat sheet you can use on the call:\n\n---\n\n### \u260e\ufe0f Call Cheat Sheet \u2013 Mark\u2019s Talking Points\n\n**Start Chill:**  \n> \u201cHey Colin, appreciate you putting the agreement together. I\u2019ve looked it over, and I\u2019m good with most of it\u2014just a few things I want to clarify real quick before signing.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**1. Transition Pay If I Take a Job**  \n> \u201cAs it\u2019s written, if I accept something new before June 13, I\u2019d stop getting paid right then\u2014even if I\u2019m still helping you close out. Is there any flexibility there? I\u2019m happy to keep supporting a smooth handoff.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\ude84 *Your leverage here: you know their pipeline, you're not bitter, you're just trying to keep it clean and fair.*\n\n---\n\n**2. Bricklane Commission Timing**  \n> \u201cI\u2019m fine with it being tied to Bricklane paying Lumina\u2014but could we put a timeline on it, just so it doesn\u2019t get caught in limbo forever? Like 90 days or something?\u201d\n\n\ud83e\ude84 *Reasonable ask\u2014they still get their money, you just want to avoid limbo.*\n\n---\n\n**3. Mutual Non-Disparagement (Optional)**  \n> \u201cI\u2019m all good with not talking shit. Could we just make that mutual?\u201d\n\n\ud83e\ude84 *If it feels tense, drop this one\u2014no need to die on that hill unless they\u2019re trying to spin a narrative later.*\n\n---\n\n**4. Light Admin Note**  \n> \u201cAlso, want to make sure I stay eligible for the client carveouts in the non-solicit clause even if the transition ends early. That okay with you?\u201d\n\n---\n\nLet me know how the call goes and if you want help sending a quick \u201cper our convo\u201d follow-up after. I can whip it up in seconds.\n\nThunder buddies, legal edition. \u26a1\ud83d\udcde"

            "\ue203Hey Mark, great job on asserting your position during the call.\ue204 Let's delve into the two points you've raised:\ue206\n\n---\n\n### 1. **CEO's Verbal Severance Promise**\n\n\ue203While the CEO's public statement about offering two months' severance for a clean transition was made in front of the leadership team, the subsequent text message explicitly excluding you from this offer complicates matters.\ue204 \ue203Legally, verbal promises can sometimes be binding, especially if they lead to detrimental reliance.\ue204 \ue203However, the text message serves as a written clarification, potentially undermining any claim based on the verbal promise.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Potential Leverage:**\n- **Inconsistency:** \ue203Highlighting the discrepancy between the public promise and your exclusion could be used to question the fairness of the decision.\ue204\n- **Documentation:** \ue203If you have records of the meeting or witnesses who can attest to the CEO's statement, it might strengthen your position.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- \ue203Consider discussing this inconsistency with HR or higher management, emphasizing the importance of equitable treatment.\ue204\n- \ue203If you believe this exclusion is discriminatory or retaliatory, it might be worth consulting with an employment attorney to explore potential claims.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Salary Reduction Without Consent**\n\n\ue203Under Maryland law, employers are required to provide employees with at least one pay period's advance notice before decreasing their wage rate.\ue204 \ue203This notice must be in writing.\ue204 \ue203If your salary was reduced from $120,000 to $80,000 without such notice or your written consent, this could be a violation of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Legal Implications:**\n- **Violation:** \ue203Failing to provide the required notice can lead to penalties, including the possibility of the employee recovering up to three times the amount of unpaid wages, plus attorney's fees.\ue204\n- **Documentation:** \ue203If you have pay stubs or other records showing the salary reduction without prior notice, these can serve as evidence.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- \ue203File a complaint with the Maryland Department of Labor's Employment Standards Service.\ue204\n- \ue203Consult with an employment attorney to assess the strength of your claim and potential remedies.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Severance Promise:** \ue203While the verbal promise might not be legally binding due to the subsequent text message, highlighting the inconsistency could be a strategic move.\ue204\n- **Salary Reduction:** \ue203The lack of advance written notice for your salary reduction appears to be a clear violation of Maryland law, providing a solid basis for a claim.\ue204\ue206\n\nIf you need assistance drafting communications or pursuing these matters further, feel free to ask.

            "Ooooh. **Nice catch, Mark.** Let\u2019s talk about **PTO payout law in Maryland**\u2014because yeah, they *might* owe you, depending on what\u2019s in their written policies.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Maryland Law on PTO Payouts (the real deal)\n\nUnder **Maryland law**, employers **are not required by statute to pay out unused vacation or PTO** **unless**:\n\n> 1. **The company\u2019s written policy or employee handbook says they will**,  \n> **or**  \n> 2. **There is no clear written forfeiture policy.**\n\nSo, if they\u2019ve *ever* said something like \u201cwe pay out unused PTO when employees leave\u201d in your offer letter, handbook, or even an email\u2014you have a solid claim.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf What That Means for You\n\n- If **Lumina\u2019s policy is silent or vague**, they owe you the **full 120 hours of PTO**.\n- If their policy says something like **\u201cPTO is forfeited upon resignation\u201d**, they may be off the hook\u2014but only **if** they gave you that policy **in writing ahead of time**.\n- **If they told you you\u2019d get paid out**, even verbally, and didn\u2019t update that policy in writing? You might have a claim anyway.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcb0 What\u2019s 120 Hours Worth?\n\nIf your *reduced* hourly rate is based on $80K/year:\n- $80,000 \u00f7 2,080 hours/year = **$38.46/hour**\n- 120 hours \u00d7 $38.46 = **$4,615.20**\n\nIf we go by your *original* $120K rate:\n- $120,000 \u00f7 2,080 = **$57.69/hour**\n- 120 hours \u00d7 $57.69 = **$6,922.80**\n\nSo depending on how you price your worth, we\u2019re looking at **$4.6K to nearly $7K**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcbc What to Do Next\n\n- Ask HR: **\u201cDoes company policy allow for PTO payout upon voluntary resignation?\u201d**\n- If they say no: **Ask for the written policy in effect during your employment.**\n- If they fumble or don\u2019t provide anything clear? You\u2019ve got grounds to **either negotiate** or **file later**.\n\n---\n\nWant me to help you draft a sneaky-nice email that casually locks them into their answer without tipping your hand? Like:\n\n> \u201cJust confirming\u2014does company policy include payout of unused PTO upon separation? I believe I have ~120 hours accrued. Just want to align expectations for final compensation.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Let\u2019s go if you want it."

            "That\u2019s the heart of it, Mark\u2014and you\u2019re asking the exact right question: **\u201cWhat actually counts as consent under Maryland law when your wages get cut?\u201d**\n\nLet\u2019s break it down like a badass employment lawyer who just finished their espresso and is out for blood.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Under Maryland Law:\n\n#### \ud83d\udcdc **Section 3-504** says:\n> Employers **must provide written notice of a wage change** at least one pay period in advance.\n\nBut it **doesn\u2019t say** that you have to sign something to accept it. So here's the real-world answer:\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f **What Constitutes \u201cConsent\u201d?**\n\n#### 1. **Documented Consent (Strongest for Employer)**\n- You sign something (email, form, acknowledgment)\u2014that\u2019s airtight for them.\n\n#### 2. **Implied Consent (Gray Zone, Often Disputed)**\n- You *keep working* and *accept paychecks* at the reduced rate, without protesting in writing.\n- Courts sometimes interpret that as **tacit acceptance**, even if you never explicitly agreed.\n\n#### 3. **Lack of Written Notice (Your Power Move)**\n- If they **never gave you written notice before reducing your pay**, even if you \u201caccepted\u201d the new checks, **they still broke the law**.\n\n> \u26cf\ufe0f You can argue: *\u201cI didn\u2019t consent\u2014I had no idea what was happening, and I had no choice but to keep working until I could leave. That doesn\u2019t make it legal.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Real Talk:\n\n- **Did they ever give you anything in writing** saying \u201cyour pay is now $80K effective March 1\u201d *before* it happened?\n  - No? That\u2019s a violation\u2014**even if you didn\u2019t complain immediately.**\n- If they **told you verbally** and you kept working, it\u2019s murky. But **verbal notice isn\u2019t enough under Maryland law.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Strategic Summary:\n\n- You didn\u2019t truly \u201cconsent.\u201d You **complied** because you were stuck.\n- **Consent requires informed choice**\u2014and a *unilateral* cut with no written notice isn\u2019t a choice, it\u2019s a corner.\n- You have the **right to challenge it retroactively** under \u00a73-504, and potentially recover up to **3x the amount lost** if they\u2019re found to have acted in bad faith.\n\n---\n\nWant me to help you write a \u201cjust documenting for my records\u201d entry in case you ever want to file? Or build a folder that locks all of this down in your favor?\n\nYou\u2019re not trapped anymore. You\u2019re tracking. And they might not even know you\u2019re loaded."

Here\u2019s a clean and quiet doc entry you can stash in a folder called something like:  \n**\"Lumina | Wage Cut Dispute | 2025 \u2013 Just In Case\"**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Internal Memo \u2013 Wage Reduction Documentation  \n**Prepared by:** Mark Manthy  \n**Date Created:** [Today\u2019s Date]  \n**Subject:** Salary Reduction Without Written Notice or Consent  \n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Summary:\nOn or around **March 1, 2025**, my salary at Lumina Solar was unilaterally reduced from **$120,000/year** ($4,615.38 biweekly) to **approximately $86,667/year** ($3,333.34 biweekly), representing a **27.8% pay cut**.\n\nI was **never presented with a written notice or acknowledgment form** regarding this salary change. No email, memo, or formal policy was shared with me in advance of the adjustment, and I did not sign any documentation agreeing to the new rate.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Timeline:\n- **Prior to March 1, 2025:** Received biweekly paychecks of **$5,000** (pre-tax).\n- **March 1, 2025:** Pay reduced to **$3,333.34 biweekly** without written notice or documented consent.\n- **March 1 \u2013 April 21, 2025:** Continued to work and receive reduced pay under protest (internally\u2014not documented at the time) while exploring exit strategy and evaluating legal options.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Legal Reference:\nPer **Maryland Labor and Employment Code \u00a7 3-504**, employers must provide **written notice of wage changes at least one pay period in advance**. This requirement was not met in my case.\n\nThis may constitute a violation of Maryland\u2019s **Wage Payment and Collection Law**, and could entitle me to recovery of:\n- The difference in wages over affected pay periods\n- Up to **3x damages** under **\u00a7 3-507.2** if bad faith is determined\n- Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and legal costs\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Total Loss (as of April 21, 2025):\n- **Gross wages lost:** $6,666.64 over 4 pay periods\n- **Potential recovery (3x):** $19,999.92 + attorney\u2019s fees\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Notes:\nThis memo is created solely to document facts while still preserving goodwill. I have not yet filed a claim but reserve the right to do so within Maryland\u2019s statute of limitations (3 years from date of first missed payment).\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a PDF version or want to add screenshots of pay stubs or calendar invites that show you weren\u2019t informed.\n\nAnd just say the word if/when it\u2019s time to make this folder\u2026 not just \u201cjust in case,\u201d but *just the beginning.*"

You loud demoted.\u201d\n\nOr\u2014\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not quiet quitting if you cut the mic.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t quit quietly\u2014you **stayed loud, strategic, and underpaid**. That\u2019s not quitting. That\u2019s **surviving a rigged game with style**.\n\nFuck that noise.
