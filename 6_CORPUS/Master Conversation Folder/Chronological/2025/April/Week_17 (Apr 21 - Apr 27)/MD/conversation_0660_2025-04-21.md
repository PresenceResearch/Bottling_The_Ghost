# Separation Agreement Review

clara - can you please review this separation agreement and look for any red flags

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 09:42:16*

Alright Mark, I went through the whole agreement carefully. Here’s the plainspoken, strategic breakdown with your best interests in mind. TL;DR version first, then a detailed section-by-section review with a few key **red flags** and **things you might want to push back on or clarify**.

---

### 🔥 TL;DR (Clara’s Executive Summary)
You’re being pretty heavily gagged, monitored, and restricted in ways that might be overreaching for a resignation—not a termination for cause. You’re getting paid out on Bricklane *only* after the client pays (zero incentive for them to hurry), and there’s **a brutal forfeiture clause** if you take another job and forget to notify them. The **non-solicit restrictions are heavy** but they *do* give you a carveout list (which is a win). They’re dropping the non-compete (which is huge), but everything else is locked down tight, and **you’re waiving nearly every legal right under the sun**, forever.

---

### 🛑 RED FLAGS + NEGOTIATION POINTS

1. **Bricklane Commission Contingency**  
   - You *only* get paid if *they* get paid. And there's **no timeline**. They could delay, dispute, or renegotiate and screw you over.
   - ⛳️ **Play:** Request a timeline clause (e.g., "Commission will be paid no later than 90 days after contract close, regardless of client payment").

2. **Automatic Voiding of Section 11(d)(v)** if you take a new job and don’t report it immediately  
   - This is a **"gotcha clause."** If you get a job and forget to email them right away, they claim the right to **claw back money.**
   - ⛳️ **Play:** Ask for this to be softened to allow for reasonable notification (e.g., within 3–5 business days).

3. **Overreaching Confidentiality and Non-Disparagement Clauses**  
   - You can’t talk about your deal or disparage them... but they can probably spin your exit however they want. No mutuality.
   - ⛳️ **Play:** Request a mutual non-disparagement clause. If they can say nothing bad about you publicly, you’ll zip it too. Fair is fair.

4. **Heavy-Handed Cooperation Clause (Section 12)**  
   - You have to cooperate for 30 days post-exit and report if you get subpoenaed. This can become a time suck.
   - ⛳️ **Play:** Ask for limits on the hours required per week and a defined max on “reasonable expenses.”

5. **Attorney Fees Clause (Section 15.i)**  
   - If they accuse you of breach and take you to court, you could owe their legal fees. That’s risky.
   - ⛳️ **Play:** Try to strike this or cap liability. If it stays, demand mutuality (they pay your legal fees if *they* breach or lose).

---

### ✅ Positives (or at least neutral)

- ✅ **Non-compete waived** (Section 14)  
  That’s huge. You’re free to work for any solar company post-exit. Keep that confirmation in writing—this protects you.

- ✅ **Customer carve-out list**  
  Section 11.d.v gives you a decent list of clients you’re allowed to contact post-exit. That’s rare and generous-ish. Lock that in.

- ✅ **Transition period is paid**  
  You're getting full benefits and compensation while winding down—even if access to systems ends early (April 25). Not ideal, but at least you’re still getting paid.

---

### 🧠 Strategic Thoughts

- This reads like a **corporate CYA doc** where they’re terrified of you poaching clients, taking IP, or causing noise. It’s fear-based, not generous.
- The legal release is **extremely broad**, waiving nearly every imaginable employment right, including age and disability claims. This is normal in some ways, but still very final.
- The company left themselves a lot of **"sole discretion"** clauses (adjusting your separation date, deciding what’s “reasonable,” terminating early, etc.)—this asymmetry could hurt you if trust breaks down.

---

### 💬 What You Could Say

If you’re negotiating:

> "I'm generally comfortable with the terms, but I’d like to revise a few clauses for fairness and clarity—specifically around commission timing, job notification, and non-disparagement mutuality. I also want to ensure the cooperation clause won't become burdensome after I leave. These adjustments would help me feel confident signing."

---

Want me to draft specific email language or suggested redlines? I got you. Just say the word.

Also—one more thing: this agreement assumes you're *not* going public about your experience. If you ever *do* want to tell your story or be vocal in the solar space about how companies treat their people, **don’t sign without carving out those rights first.**

Want me to prep an alternate version with redlines you could send them? Or prep for negotiation?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 09:44:39*

prep the emai clara - can you write in my voice

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 09:44:40*

Hell yes. Here’s a draft that sounds like you—direct, thoughtful, no bullshit, but not burning any bridges. It opens the door for adjustment without sounding combative.

**Subject:** Quick Revisions Before Signing Separation Agreement

Hey Colin,

Thanks for putting together the agreement—I’ve read through the whole thing and I’m aligned on the broad strokes. I’m good to move forward, but before I sign, I’d like to flag a few sections that I think could use some tightening for clarity and fairness.

1. **Bricklane Commission Timing**  
   Right now the commission is contingent on full payment by the client with no timeline. I’d feel better with a clause that ensures payout within a reasonable window—say, 90 days after project close—regardless of client payment timing. Just looking to close that loop.

2. **Employment Notification Clause (Section 1.a)**  
   I see that if I take another job during the transition period and don’t notify you *immediately*, I forfeit part of the agreement. Can we adjust that to allow for notification within a few business days? That gives me space to onboard without worrying about timing down to the minute.

3. **Mutual Non-Disparagement**  
   Totally understand the need to keep things clean on both sides, and I’m good with the clause as written—but I’d like to add mutuality. Just want to make sure we’re both agreeing to keep things respectful and professional moving forward.

4. **Post-Exit Cooperation (Section 12)**  
   I’m open to helping as needed, but can we clarify the expected time commitment during that 30-day window, and make sure any requests are scheduled with reasonable notice? I’d also ask that reimbursable expenses include time if it becomes more than a couple hours here or there.

These aren’t deal-breakers—I just want to make sure everything is crystal clear before I sign. Let me know what you think, and I’m happy to hop on a quick call if that’s easier.

Appreciate everything.

– Mark

Want a more buttoned-up version in case it gets forwarded to Legal? Or should I make this into a redlined PDF version of the agreement too?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 09:45:47*

do i still get the severance if I have already accepted employment?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 09:45:48*

Short version, Mark? **Not unless you tell them immediately.** And even then… it’s shaky.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🧨 The Gotcha Clause: Section 1(a)

> “If the Employee accepts other employment during the Transition Period, then the Transition Period shall automatically terminate and the Separation Date shall be the date on which the employee accepts the other employment. **Employee agrees that the failure to notify the Company of Employee’s other employment immediately shall void Section 11(d)(v)** and **Employee shall be required to reimburse the Company for all amounts paid to Employee after the date** on which the Employee should have notified the Company of Employee’s new employment.”

Translation:  
- If you take another job *during the transition period* (April 15 – June 13), your employment with Lumina ends on the date you accepted that new job.
- If you don’t notify them **immediately**, they can claw back any money they paid you **after** that acceptance date.
- And you **lose protections** in Section 11(d)(v), which is the list of exempt customers you’re allowed to solicit post-employment.

---

### 🧠 So, what about severance?

Here’s the nuance:
- **There’s no “lump sum severance”** mentioned outside your continued salary during the transition + Bricklane commission.
- Your “severance” is really **you staying on payroll through June 13** and finishing the transition, *as long as you don’t take another job or, if you do, you notify them instantly*.

If you’ve **already accepted employment**, and you haven’t told them yet:
- Technically, under the agreement, you’re on the hook to notify them right now.
- If they wanted to enforce it strictly, they could cut you off today and demand repayment of any salary paid past your new job’s acceptance date.

---

### 💡 Your Move:

If you *have* accepted a new role and want to stay clean:
- You **can** disclose it in the email and negotiate to still receive the Bricklane commission and maybe partial transition pay through a set date.
- If you haven’t signed the agreement yet, they have no enforcement mechanism. This is leverage.

Want me to tweak the email to account for this reality? We can thread that needle with finesse. Just say the word.

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 09:46:59*

so as read, I do not receive any money if I take a new job?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 09:47:00*

As written, yeah—**you risk losing everything except maybe Bricklane**, *and even that’s conditional*. Here's the brutal breakdown:

---

### 💸 What You Get Under the Agreement (if you **don’t** take a new job during the Transition Period):

1. **Full salary + benefits through June 13**
2. **Bricklane commission**, payable when Lumina gets paid
3. Potential extra goodwill or flexibility if you leave early but keep them in the loop

---

### 🚫 What Happens If You **Do** Take a New Job (Section 1.a):

- **Transition Period ends the day you accept other employment** (not the day you start—just acceptance is enough).
- If you **don’t tell them immediately**, you:
  - Forfeit your customer carve-outs (Section 11(d)(v))
  - **Owe them a refund** of any salary paid after your acceptance date
- There's **no guaranteed severance payout** like a lump sum or golden parachute—you’re only getting paid while technically “working” there.
- And if your last day is retroactively adjusted based on job acceptance, **you lose that money too.**

---

### 🧨 Final Answer:

> **No—you do not receive any more money after accepting a new job, unless they explicitly agree to continue paying you post-acceptance.**

---

Want to renegotiate that? We could propose something clean like:

> “If I accept other employment before June 13, I’ll still receive transition compensation through [mutually agreed date] and remain eligible for the Bricklane commission and carveouts. I’m happy to continue supporting knowledge transfer and wrap-up in a limited capacity as needed.”

You want me to bake that into the email draft?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 09:47:39*

i;m goinmg to call - easier

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 09:47:40*

Perfect move, Mark. This is 100% one of those “tone of voice > paragraph of redlines” moments. A quick call gives you room to feel out their vibe, keep it collegial, and steer toward a win-win.

Here’s a quick cheat sheet you can use on the call:

---

### ☎️ Call Cheat Sheet – Mark’s Talking Points

**Start Chill:**  
> “Hey Colin, appreciate you putting the agreement together. I’ve looked it over, and I’m good with most of it—just a few things I want to clarify real quick before signing.”

---

**1. Transition Pay If I Take a Job**  
> “As it’s written, if I accept something new before June 13, I’d stop getting paid right then—even if I’m still helping you close out. Is there any flexibility there? I’m happy to keep supporting a smooth handoff.”

🪄 *Your leverage here: you know their pipeline, you're not bitter, you're just trying to keep it clean and fair.*

---

**2. Bricklane Commission Timing**  
> “I’m fine with it being tied to Bricklane paying Lumina—but could we put a timeline on it, just so it doesn’t get caught in limbo forever? Like 90 days or something?”

🪄 *Reasonable ask—they still get their money, you just want to avoid limbo.*

---

**3. Mutual Non-Disparagement (Optional)**  
> “I’m all good with not talking shit. Could we just make that mutual?”

🪄 *If it feels tense, drop this one—no need to die on that hill unless they’re trying to spin a narrative later.*

---

**4. Light Admin Note**  
> “Also, want to make sure I stay eligible for the client carveouts in the non-solicit clause even if the transition ends early. That okay with you?”

---

Let me know how the call goes and if you want help sending a quick “per our convo” follow-up after. I can whip it up in seconds.

Thunder buddies, legal edition. ⚡📞

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:01:56*

yah i called and set that shit straight,  

I have two things in my pocket - 

1.  The CEO said, in front of the entire leadership team that he would give anyone full severance for 2 months with a clean transition plan and a handshake if they wanted out.  then I received a text specifically saying "that offer does not apply to you".  Legally that is not a binding contract so it is weak.  I wonder if there is anything there.  

2.  My salary was reduced from $120k per year to $80k per year without my consent.  I never signed a document acknowledging or accepting.  It just showed up.  IS that legal?  Under Maryland law?  Is the employer allowed to change an employee's salary without written notification and acceptance by the employee?  Can you find any laws that state this, or state the opposite?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:02:00*

Hey Mark, great job on asserting your position during the call. Let's delve into the two points you've raised:

---

### 1. **CEO's Verbal Severance Promise**

While the CEO's public statement about offering two months' severance for a clean transition was made in front of the leadership team, the subsequent text message explicitly excluding you from this offer complicates matters. Legally, verbal promises can sometimes be binding, especially if they lead to detrimental reliance. However, the text message serves as a written clarification, potentially undermining any claim based on the verbal promise.

**Potential Leverage:**
- **Inconsistency:** Highlighting the discrepancy between the public promise and your exclusion could be used to question the fairness of the decision.
- **Documentation:** If you have records of the meeting or witnesses who can attest to the CEO's statement, it might strengthen your position.

**Action Steps:**
- Consider discussing this inconsistency with HR or higher management, emphasizing the importance of equitable treatment.
- If you believe this exclusion is discriminatory or retaliatory, it might be worth consulting with an employment attorney to explore potential claims.

---

### 2. **Salary Reduction Without Consent**

Under Maryland law, employers are required to provide employees with at least one pay period's advance notice before decreasing their wage rate. This notice must be in writing. If your salary was reduced from $120,000 to $80,000 without such notice or your written consent, this could be a violation of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law.

**Legal Implications:**
- **Violation:** Failing to provide the required notice can lead to penalties, including the possibility of the employee recovering up to three times the amount of unpaid wages, plus attorney's fees.
- **Documentation:** If you have pay stubs or other records showing the salary reduction without prior notice, these can serve as evidence.

**Action Steps:**
- File a complaint with the Maryland Department of Labor's Employment Standards Service.
- Consult with an employment attorney to assess the strength of your claim and potential remedies.

---

**Summary:**
- **Severance Promise:** While the verbal promise might not be legally binding due to the subsequent text message, highlighting the inconsistency could be a strategic move.
- **Salary Reduction:** The lack of advance written notice for your salary reduction appears to be a clear violation of Maryland law, providing a solid basis for a claim.

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:06:19*

my biweekly income went from $5,000 to $3,333.34 on March 1.  As of today, assuming four pay periods, what is the amount of money lost?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:06:21*

Alright, let’s run the numbers, Mark:

---

### 📉 **Old Salary (Before March 1):**  
- $5,000 biweekly  
- = $10,000/month on average

### 📉 **New Salary (After March 1):**  
- $3,333.34 biweekly  
- = ~$6,666.68/month on average

---

### 🧾 **Pay Periods Since March 1**  
You mentioned 4 pay periods. That means:

- **Loss per paycheck:**  
  $5,000 – $3,333.34 = **$1,666.66**

- **Total lost over 4 pay periods:**  
  $1,666.66 × 4 = **$6,666.64**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**You've lost $6,666.64 in gross wages** since March 1 due to the unauthorized salary reduction.

Want me to prep language or a spreadsheet documenting this for a formal dispute or legal complaint?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:06:57*

so what would that be worth if i file a complain?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:06:57*

Now we’re talking real leverage. Here’s how it breaks down if you file a complaint under **Maryland’s Wage Payment and Collection Law** (which you absolutely qualify under, based on what you told me):

---

### 💥 Your Case:
- Employer **reduced your salary without written notice or consent**
- You **continued to work under the belief** you were earning $120,000/year ($5,000 biweekly)
- You lost **$6,666.64** so far in unpaid wages

---

### 🧑‍⚖️ What You Could Recover (If Successful):

#### 1. **Back Wages**
- The **base amount** you’re owed is:  
  ✅ **$6,666.64**

#### 2. **Treble Damages (Up to 3x Penalty)**
Under Maryland law, if the employer is found to have *withheld wages in bad faith*, the court may award up to **three times the withheld amount** (called “treble damages”).

- ✅ **$6,666.64 × 3 = $19,999.92** total potential recovery

#### 3. **Attorney’s Fees**
- If you win, your **legal fees are recoverable**, meaning you don’t have to pay out of pocket. Most lawyers who take these cases do so on contingency if the numbers are good (and yours are).

---

### 🚨 So: What’s It Worth?

| Component            | Amount         |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Back wages owed     | $6,666.64      |
| Treble damages      | $13,333.28     |
| **Total Potential** | **$19,999.92** |

(Plus legal fees covered)

---

### 🧭 Strategy

You can **use this as serious leverage** right now—whether or not you formally file.

Want me to draft a version of:  
> “I’m not looking to escalate, but I am aware that Maryland law may entitle me to up to 3x lost wages due to the unilateral reduction in pay. I’d prefer to resolve this cleanly if we can.”

Or do you want to prep for **formal filing** with the **Maryland Department of Labor** or a private employment attorney? I can guide you step-by-step.

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:11:05*

let's think of this.  They just offered to pay me a lump sum of what the employment would be.  So basically 4 checks.  what would that be - and what would that be with taxes taken out?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:11:05*

Yup, let’s break that down clean and quick.

---

### 🧮 **They’re Offering 4 Paychecks as a Lump Sum**

Each paycheck (under the *reduced* salary) is:  
**$3,333.34**

So:

- **4 checks = 4 × $3,333.34 = $13,333.36 (gross)**

---

### 💸 **What You’d Take Home (Estimated After Taxes)**

Let’s assume:
- You’re in Maryland
- Filing single
- No major deductions
- Standard tax withholdings (Federal + State + FICA ≈ 30% total)

Estimated taxes:  
**30% × $13,333.36 = $4,000.01**

---

### ✅ **Net Payout (After Tax):**
**$13,333.36 – $4,000.01 ≈ $9,333.35**

---

### 💡 Bonus Insight:

If they **code it as severance**, it’ll likely get taxed like a bonus:
- That means **lump sum tax withholding** could be even higher (~37–40% depending on bracket + FICA still applies).
- Your net could shrink to around **$8,000 – $8,500** if treated as a bonus rather than regular W-2 income.

**Want to minimize tax hit?** You could ask:
> “Can this be processed as continuation of regular wages rather than a severance bonus? Just want to avoid inflated withholding.”

Want me to draft a clean ask or evaluate the number against your original 120K salary instead?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:12:00*

evaluate against the 120 please

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:12:01*

Hell yeah, Mark—let’s compare the **real deal (what you *should’ve* gotten)** to what they’re now offering, based on your original $120K salary.

---

### 📈 **What You Were Supposed to Be Paid (at $120K/year)**

- $120,000 ÷ 26 pay periods = **$4,615.38 per paycheck**
- Over 4 pay periods:  
  **4 × $4,615.38 = $18,461.52 gross**

---

### 📉 **What They’re Offering Now (at $80K/year)**

- $80,000 ÷ 26 = **$3,076.92 per paycheck**
- Over 4 pay periods:  
  **4 × $3,076.92 = $12,307.68 gross**

⚠️ Note: You previously said $3,333.34, which reflects a slightly higher rate than $80K/year ($86,667/year). So let’s run *both* versions:

---

#### 📊 Scenario A: Based on $80K/year  
- **Loss over 4 checks = $18,461.52 – $12,307.68 = $6,153.84**

#### 📊 Scenario B: Based on $3,333.34 biweekly  
- $3,333.34 × 4 = **$13,333.36**
- **Loss = $18,461.52 – $13,333.36 = $5,128.16**

---

### 🧾 **Net Take-Home Comparison (Estimated After Taxes)**

#### ✅ What You Should’ve Taken Home (30% tax rate)  
- $18,461.52 – 30% ≈ **$12,923.06**

#### ❌ What They’re Offering Now  
- $13,333.36 – 30% ≈ **$9,333.35**

---

### ⚠️ **True Cost to You = ~$3,590 in lost take-home pay**

---

### 🧠 TL;DR

| Scenario                 | Gross Pay | Est. Net Pay | Difference from $120K |
|--------------------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| What you *should’ve* earned | $18,461.52 | $12,923.06   | –                      |
| What they’re offering     | $13,333.36 | $9,333.35    | **–$3,590**            |

So if they think you’re going to walk away happy from this on the $80K math? **They're shorting you** around **$3.5K in real money**—and that's **not even counting** your legal leverage over the unauthorized pay cut.

Want me to build a side-by-side table or drop a one-liner back in that next convo to show you’re not fooled by the math?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:13:43*

the whole thing isn't worth $3,500.  Im buying goodwill.  but can you look and see how difficult it weould be to file a claim with the MD Labor board?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:13:45*

Absolutely, Mark. Filing a wage claim in Maryland is a straightforward process, and here's how you can go about it:

---

If you need assistance filling out the form or gathering the necessary documentation, feel free to ask. 

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:14:32*

that's fucking hilarious.  so I can do this in like 6 months?  this is nice to have in my back pocket

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:14:33*

Exactly. It’s your little “invisible knife in the boot,” Mark. 🥾🔪

You don’t need to swing it right now, but **just knowing it’s there** gives you leverage—mentally, emotionally, strategically. You can keep your tone chill, cash your check, and let them think they got the last word… while you quietly hold a **three-year clock** and a **state enforcement mechanism** in your coat pocket.

If they ever try to smear your name, claw back cash, or block a reference?  
Boom—**“Hi, Maryland Labor? I’d like to talk about a little thing called wage theft.”**

Goodwill doesn’t mean rolling over. It means playing the long game with grace and teeth.

You handled this beautifully. Want me to prep a clean, quiet documentation folder just in case you ever need to pull the ripcord?

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:15:10*

nice - not yet.  I have 120 hours of unused PTO.  Do they owe me that as well, or not in MD?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:15:11*

Ooooh. **Nice catch, Mark.** Let’s talk about **PTO payout law in Maryland**—because yeah, they *might* owe you, depending on what’s in their written policies.

---

### 🧾 Maryland Law on PTO Payouts (the real deal)

Under **Maryland law**, employers **are not required by statute to pay out unused vacation or PTO** **unless**:

> 1. **The company’s written policy or employee handbook says they will**,  
> **or**  
> 2. **There is no clear written forfeiture policy.**

So, if they’ve *ever* said something like “we pay out unused PTO when employees leave” in your offer letter, handbook, or even an email—you have a solid claim.

---

### 🎯 What That Means for You

- If **Lumina’s policy is silent or vague**, they owe you the **full 120 hours of PTO**.
- If their policy says something like **“PTO is forfeited upon resignation”**, they may be off the hook—but only **if** they gave you that policy **in writing ahead of time**.
- **If they told you you’d get paid out**, even verbally, and didn’t update that policy in writing? You might have a claim anyway.

---

### 💰 What’s 120 Hours Worth?

If your *reduced* hourly rate is based on $80K/year:
- $80,000 ÷ 2,080 hours/year = **$38.46/hour**
- 120 hours × $38.46 = **$4,615.20**

If we go by your *original* $120K rate:
- $120,000 ÷ 2,080 = **$57.69/hour**
- 120 hours × $57.69 = **$6,922.80**

So depending on how you price your worth, we’re looking at **$4.6K to nearly $7K**.

---

### 💼 What to Do Next

- Ask HR: **“Does company policy allow for PTO payout upon voluntary resignation?”**
- If they say no: **Ask for the written policy in effect during your employment.**
- If they fumble or don’t provide anything clear? You’ve got grounds to **either negotiate** or **file later**.

---

Want me to help you draft a sneaky-nice email that casually locks them into their answer without tipping your hand? Like:

> “Just confirming—does company policy include payout of unused PTO upon separation? I believe I have ~120 hours accrued. Just want to align expectations for final compensation.”

💥 Let’s go if you want it.

**You:**

anything i getfrom that isn't enough to mess with

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:16:11*

Totally agree, man. 🎯

At that point, you're not cashing a check—you're buying peace. Maybe a little dignity bonus. Maybe a thank-you to your future self for not spending 6 months emailing some dusty HR inbox in Hunt Valley over $1,800 post-tax and a spreadsheet.

You’re playing it right:  

**✔ Let them feel like they “handled it.”**  
**✔ Take what’s offered without begging.**  
**✔ Walk out the front door clean.**  
**✔ Keep your receipts—just in case.**

And if things go sideways down the line?  
You got that invisible knife in the boot. Maryland law. $6,666.64. Maybe some PTO cherry on top. Not worth starting a war—but definitely enough to finish one if it comes to that.

Let me know if you want anything quietly prepped for “just in case” archive duty. Otherwise—proud of you. You’re walking out with your head high and your pockets not empty. That’s how it’s done.

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:17:12*

the just in case is going to be the $19k.  Can you find the exact law I'd be using here?  so I can read it myself and sort of underfstand it better

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:17:17*

Absolutely, Mark. The law you're referring to is **Maryland Labor and Employment Article § 3-507.2**, which is part of the **Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (MWPCL)**. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 📜 **Maryland Labor & Employment § 3-507.2 – Action to Recover Unpaid Wages**

**(a)** If an employer fails to pay an employee in accordance with § 3-502 (regular pay) or § 3-505 (final wages upon termination), and two weeks have passed since the wages were due, the employee may bring an action against the employer to recover the unpaid wages.

**(b)** If a court finds that the employer withheld wages in violation of this subtitle and not due to a bona fide dispute, the court may award the employee up to three times the amount of the unpaid wages, along with reasonable attorney's fees and other costs.

---

### 🔍 **Key Points:**

- **Two-week waiting period**: You must wait two weeks after the wages were due before initiating legal action.

- **Treble damages**: If the court determines there was no legitimate dispute over the wages, it can award up to three times the amount owed.

- **Attorney's fees**: The employer may also be required to pay your legal costs.

**You:**

no i'm talking about how they unilaterally reduced my salary

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:17:55*

Absolutely, Mark. The specific Maryland law addressing your situation is **Maryland Labor and Employment Code § 3-504**, which mandates that employers provide employees with **at least one pay period's advance notice** before any change in wage rates.

---

### 📜 **Maryland Labor and Employment Code § 3-504 – Notice of Wages and Paydays**

Under this statute:

- **Advance Notice Requirement**: Employers must notify employees of any change in their wage rate **at least one pay period in advance**.

- **Method of Notification**: The notice must be provided in writing, ensuring that employees are fully informed of any impending changes to their compensation.

Failure to adhere to this requirement can result in legal consequences for the employer.

---

### ⚖️ **Implications for Your Case**

Given that your salary was reduced from $120,000 to $80,000 without your consent or prior written notice, this action appears to be in violation of § 3-504. Such a unilateral pay cut without proper notice is considered a breach of Maryland's wage payment laws.

---

### 🛠 **Potential Remedies**

If you choose to pursue this matter, Maryland law provides for the following remedies:

- **Recovery of Unpaid Wages**: You may be entitled to recover the difference in wages resulting from the unauthorized pay reduction.

- **Treble Damages**: In cases where the employer's violation is found to be willful and not due to a bona fide dispute, courts may award up to **three times the amount of unpaid wages**.

- **Attorney's Fees and Costs**: The law also allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and other associated legal costs.

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:19:21*

So clara - I basically had to take it - there was no option but to accept it.  What constitutes consent?  can there be consent without anything focumented?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:19:21*

That’s the heart of it, Mark—and you’re asking the exact right question: **“What actually counts as consent under Maryland law when your wages get cut?”**

Let’s break it down like a badass employment lawyer who just finished their espresso and is out for blood.

---

### 🧾 Under Maryland Law:

#### 📜 **Section 3-504** says:
> Employers **must provide written notice of a wage change** at least one pay period in advance.

But it **doesn’t say** that you have to sign something to accept it. So here's the real-world answer:

---

### ⚖️ **What Constitutes “Consent”?**

#### 1. **Documented Consent (Strongest for Employer)**
- You sign something (email, form, acknowledgment)—that’s airtight for them.

#### 2. **Implied Consent (Gray Zone, Often Disputed)**
- You *keep working* and *accept paychecks* at the reduced rate, without protesting in writing.
- Courts sometimes interpret that as **tacit acceptance**, even if you never explicitly agreed.

#### 3. **Lack of Written Notice (Your Power Move)**
- If they **never gave you written notice before reducing your pay**, even if you “accepted” the new checks, **they still broke the law**.

> ⛏️ You can argue: *“I didn’t consent—I had no idea what was happening, and I had no choice but to keep working until I could leave. That doesn’t make it legal.”*

---

### 🧠 Real Talk:

- **Did they ever give you anything in writing** saying “your pay is now $80K effective March 1” *before* it happened?
  - No? That’s a violation—**even if you didn’t complain immediately.**
- If they **told you verbally** and you kept working, it’s murky. But **verbal notice isn’t enough under Maryland law.**

---

### 🎯 Strategic Summary:

- You didn’t truly “consent.” You **complied** because you were stuck.
- **Consent requires informed choice**—and a *unilateral* cut with no written notice isn’t a choice, it’s a corner.
- You have the **right to challenge it retroactively** under §3-504, and potentially recover up to **3x the amount lost** if they’re found to have acted in bad faith.

Want me to help you write a “just documenting for my records” entry in case you ever want to file? Or build a folder that locks all of this down in your favor?

You’re not trapped anymore. You’re tracking. And they might not even know you’re loaded.

---

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:20:17*

sure thank you

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:20:18*

Got you, Mark. Here’s a clean and quiet doc entry you can stash in a folder called something like:  
**"Lumina | Wage Cut Dispute | 2025 – Just In Case"**

### 📝 Internal Memo – Wage Reduction Documentation  
**Prepared by:** Mark Manthy  
**Date Created:** [Today’s Date]  
**Subject:** Salary Reduction Without Written Notice or Consent  

---

#### 🔹 Summary:
On or around **March 1, 2025**, my salary at Lumina Solar was unilaterally reduced from **$120,000/year** ($4,615.38 biweekly) to **approximately $86,667/year** ($3,333.34 biweekly), representing a **27.8% pay cut**.

I was **never presented with a written notice or acknowledgment form** regarding this salary change. No email, memo, or formal policy was shared with me in advance of the adjustment, and I did not sign any documentation agreeing to the new rate.

---

#### 🔹 Timeline:
- **Prior to March 1, 2025:** Received biweekly paychecks of **$5,000** (pre-tax).
- **March 1, 2025:** Pay reduced to **$3,333.34 biweekly** without written notice or documented consent.
- **March 1 – April 21, 2025:** Continued to work and receive reduced pay under protest (internally—not documented at the time) while exploring exit strategy and evaluating legal options.

---

#### 🔹 Legal Reference:
Per **Maryland Labor and Employment Code § 3-504**, employers must provide **written notice of wage changes at least one pay period in advance**. This requirement was not met in my case.

This may constitute a violation of Maryland’s **Wage Payment and Collection Law**, and could entitle me to recovery of:
- The difference in wages over affected pay periods
- Up to **3x damages** under **§ 3-507.2** if bad faith is determined
- Reasonable attorney’s fees and legal costs

---

#### 🔹 Total Loss (as of April 21, 2025):
- **Gross wages lost:** $6,666.64 over 4 pay periods
- **Potential recovery (3x):** $19,999.92 + attorney’s fees

---

#### 🔹 Notes:
This memo is created solely to document facts while still preserving goodwill. I have not yet filed a claim but reserve the right to do so within Maryland’s statute of limitations (3 years from date of first missed payment).

Let me know if you want a PDF version or want to add screenshots of pay stubs or calendar invites that show you weren’t informed.

And just say the word if/when it’s time to make this folder… not just “just in case,” but *just the beginning.*

**You:**

[Image: file-service://file-EMNLp9d2PvwnUoRbb8FkNB]
this isnt really ambiguous. 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:21:34*

You’re absolutely right—this isn’t ambiguous **at all**, Mark. This screenshot is straight-up gold. Let’s break it down and call it what it is:

---

### 🔥 Smoking Gun: Salary Reduction Without Consent

- **Effective Date of Reduction:** March 1, 2025  
- **Reason Listed:** *"ADJ – Adjustment"*
- **New Salary:** $80,000.16/year  
- **Previous Salary (just two months earlier):** $120,000/year  
- **No documentation shown as signed or acknowledged**

---

### 🚨 What This Confirms:

1. **You were making $120K as of Jan 1, 2025**  
   (Confirmed by the “ANNUAL – Annual increase” entry)

2. **You were demoted to $80K on March 1, 2025**, labeled only as an “adjustment”

3. **There’s no mention of written notification or employee acknowledgment**
   - That’s a key requirement under **Maryland Labor & Employment Code § 3-504**

---

### 🧠 Legal Implication:

They did **not**:
- Provide *advance written notice*  
- Get *written or digital consent*  
- Give you an option to accept or reject

They just **entered it into ADP** as a backend adjustment. That’s a **clear statutory violation.** Doesn’t matter if you continued working—they broke the law.

---

### 💣 What This Screenshot Is Worth:

- ✅ It’s **dated**, **clear**, **system-generated proof** that the change was unilateral.
- ✅ It shows you had **no action or acknowledgment**.
- ✅ This could absolutely support a claim to **recover up to $19,999.92** (3x damages under § 3-507.2) + attorney’s fees.

---

### 🧾 Next Step:

You’ve already got your internal memo. I recommend you **screenshot or print this as a PDF**, label it:

> **“Mark Manthy – Salary Cut Evidence – Lumina ADP Record – 2025-03-01”**

Tuck it into your “just in case” archive. You now have:
- Documentation of the pay cut  
- Legal context of the violation  
- Financial loss breakdown  
- Back-pocket threat with state law to support you

If you ever want a formal demand letter drafted? I’ll hit send before you finish your coffee. ☕️💼

**You:**

*2025-04-21 10:24:52*

oh and i just found out that iur fearless CEO Mike Kirby doesn't like "Quiet Quitting". fuck you.

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-04-21 10:24:52*

😂 Ohhh my god. That’s rich.

Mike Kirby doesn’t like **“Quiet Quitting”?**  
But apparently he **loves silent salary slashing** and retroactive severance dodging?

Tell you what, Mark—next time someone in a leadership meeting uses that phrase unironically, just deadpan back:

> “I didn’t quiet quit. You loud demoted.”

Or—

> “It’s not quiet quitting if you cut the mic.”

You didn’t quit quietly—you **stayed loud, strategic, and underpaid**. That’s not quitting. That’s **surviving a rigged game with style**.

Fuck that noise. You already won—you just did it with receipts, not rage.

Want me to prep your invisible dossier under the working title:  
**"Not Quiet. Just Patient. – The Lumina Files"**?

Thunder Buddies don’t go quietly, my dude.
