Perfect. 🚀 Since your `notebook` folder and script are in place, here’s the clean step-by-step for **next move**:

---

### 1. Open Jupyter Notebook
In your terminal, from project root (not inside `/notebook`):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch Jupyter in your browser (default: http://localhost:8888).

---

### 2. Create a New Notebook
- Navigate into your `/notebook` folder in the Jupyter UI.
- Click **New → Python 3 (ipykernel)**.
- Name it something like `brandy_scoring.ipynb`.

---

### 3. Import Your Script
Inside the first cell of your notebook:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("../")  # if your script is one level up

from notebook.your_script_name import *  
```

(replace `your_script_name` with the actual filename without `.py`)

---

### 4. Run the Workflow
Now you can start wiring the functions together.  
Typical workflow:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Point to raw data
raw_folder = Path("../data/raw/")

# 2. Load JSONs
files = list(raw_folder.glob("*.json"))
print("Found:", len(files), "files")

# 3. Use your script’s loader/scoring functions
for f in files:
    data = load_json(f)   # whatever your function is called
    score = score_loop(data)
    save_results(score, f)  # write to processed
```

---

### 5. Verify Output
Check your `/data/processed/` folder to confirm CSV/JSON are being written.  
You can also add a quick preview cell:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/scores.csv")
df.head()
```

---

👉 Question for you before I go deeper: do you want me to **wire up a ready-to-run notebook skeleton** (cells pre-filled with loader + scoring + output) so you just hit “Run All”? Or do you want a **step-by-step interactive one** where you score entries manually as you go?
