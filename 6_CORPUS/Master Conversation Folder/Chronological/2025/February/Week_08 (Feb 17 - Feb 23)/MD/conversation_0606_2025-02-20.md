Would you like an in-depth breakdown of any specific section, such as **PPA pricing structures** or **O&M responsibilities**?

---

**You:**

*2025-02-20 15:14:51*

is prevailing wage required

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-20 15:15:02*

Yes, **prevailing wage is required** for this project.

The **Hazlet Township Public School District** has specified that proposers must comply with the **Public Works Contractor Registration Act (P.L. 1999, c.238)**. This means:
- Contractors and their **subcontractors** must be **registered with the New Jersey Department of Labor**.
- Workers on the project must be paid **prevailing wage rates**, as per **New Jersey’s prevailing wage laws (N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.25 et seq.)**.

Additionally, the awarded proposer must provide:
- **Certified payroll records** to ensure compliance.
- Proper classification of workers based on the **New Jersey Department of Labor wage determinations**.

This requirement is standard for **public projects in New Jersey**, especially those involving school districts, to ensure fair compensation for laborers. 

Would you like me to find the **current prevailing wage rates** for this type of work in New Jersey?

**You:**

*2025-02-20 15:16:24*

are there any other requirements that would be considered non-standard

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-20 15:17:24*

Yes, there are several **non-standard requirements** in the **Hazlet Township Public School District Solar PPA RFP** that go beyond typical solar PPA agreements. Here are the key ones:  

---

### **1. Roof Work Cost Must Be Included in PPA Price Adder**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - The awarded contractor must evaluate and potentially **fund roof work** as part of the PPA.
  - Costs for **roof repairs or replacements** required for solar installation **must be included as a price adder** to the PPA rate.  
  - The district will evaluate whether to **extend the roof warranty through the life of the PPA** (specifically for **Raritan Valley Elementary School**).  

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Typically, school districts handle roof maintenance separately from solar projects.
  - Here, the contractor is responsible for assessing the **roof conditions** and ensuring that solar installation **does not void warranties**.

---

### **2. Mandatory Payment to BOE for Professional Services ($30,000)**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - The awarded contractor must **pay $30,000 to the BOE** upon execution of the PPA.  
  - This serves as a **reimbursement** for the district’s legal, consulting, and procurement costs.  

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Most PPAs do not require the contractor to **directly reimburse the school district** for procurement-related expenses.

---

### **3. Guaranteed Minimum Electricity Output (90%)**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - The contractor must **guarantee that the system produces at least 90%** of the projected annual energy output.
  - If production falls below this, the contractor **must compensate the district** for the shortfall.  

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Many PPAs include performance guarantees, but **90% is a high threshold**.
  - The contract also includes **specific degradation rates (0.5% per year)**, which the contractor must factor into system design.

---

### **4. Removal & Reinstallation Costs for Roofing Repairs**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - If **roofing repairs** are needed during the contract term, the contractor must **remove and reinstall the solar panels at their own cost**.
  - If the repair is unrelated to solar damage, the district will **reimburse the contractor** for costs **only after 10 years** into the contract.
  - Reimbursements for removals in **years 1–10** can be structured as either:
    - A **cash payment** of the actual costs.
    - An **adjustment to the PPA rate**.  

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Many PPAs place full removal/reinstallation responsibility **on the system owner (contractor)** for the **entire contract term**.
  - Here, the BOE is offering **some reimbursement**, but only after the first 10 years.

---

### **5. Temporary Shutdown Restrictions & Penalties**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - The BOE **cannot shut down the solar system** for more than **10 days within two consecutive years** (except in emergencies).
  - If the shutdown exceeds this limit, the **BOE must compensate the contractor** for:
    1. **Lost solar production** (PPA rate).
    2. **Lost SREC revenue** (contractor’s out-of-pocket loss).
    3. **Any costs related to system shutdown and reactivation**.

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Most PPAs allow the host site to perform maintenance or make necessary changes **without financial penalties**.
  - This contract **financially protects the contractor** from revenue loss due to unexpected downtime.

---

### **6. Firefighter Safety Plan Approval Required**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - The contractor **must create a Firefighter Safety Procedure Manual**.
  - The manual **must be approved by local fire safety authorities** before installation begins.

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Fire safety is always a consideration, but requiring a **custom manual approved before installation** is an additional step.

---

### **7. BOE Can Cancel a Project Site if Interconnection Costs Exceed $0.10/Watt**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - If utility-required interconnection upgrades exceed **$0.10/Watt DC**, the BOE has the right to **remove that site from the PPA**.
  - This decision must be made **before construction begins**.

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Many PPAs lock in the full site list **before interconnection costs are finalized**.
  - This provision gives the district **financial control to drop a site** if unexpected costs arise.

---

### **8. Proposer Must Be Present for Public Planning Board Hearings**  
- **Unique Requirement:**  
  - The contractor must attend **public hearings before the Planning Board** to present and answer questions about the solar project.

- **Why It's Non-Standard:**  
  - Most PPAs do not require the **solar provider to participate in public hearings**.
  - This adds a **public relations component** to the contractor’s role.

---

### **Summary of Non-Standard Requirements**
| Requirement | What Makes It Non-Standard? |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| **Roof work cost included in PPA** | Contractor must assess and possibly **fund roof repairs**. |
| **$30,000 payment to BOE** | Contractor must **reimburse the district** for procurement costs. |
| **90% minimum energy guarantee** | High performance threshold with **monetary penalties**. |
| **Solar removal & reinstallation policy** | BOE **partially reimburses** contractor after 10 years. |
| **Limits on system shutdown** | BOE must **pay contractor for lost energy** if shutdown exceeds 10 days. |
| **Fire safety plan approval required** | Firefighter plan **must be pre-approved** before installation. |
| **BOE can cancel a site over interconnection costs** | If costs exceed **$0.10/Watt**, the district can **remove that site**. |
| **Contractor must attend public hearings** | Requires contractor to **answer public questions** before the Planning Board. |

---

### **Final Thoughts**
These provisions **increase financial risks for the contractor** but **protect the district** from cost overruns. If you’re bidding, you’ll need to:
- **Carefully assess roof conditions** before finalizing your proposal.
- **Plan for compliance costs**, especially around prevailing wage, interconnection, and fire safety.
- **Price in the risk** of system removal and reinstallation if roofing work is needed.

Would you like a **summary document** for easy reference? Or do you need help estimating **cost impacts** based on these requirements?
