Some time after that, \nL98: she found herself back before any of that had happened. Again, and again, and \nL99: again... Then her friends began to join her on occasion, which helped with the \nL100: variety a bit. Now she, as well as over two dozen of her friends, fellows, and \nL101: in some cases erstwhile antagonists are doing the same thing - as well as other \nL102: worlds, worlds that none of them could have imagined. Friends have been made, \nL103: horizons broadened... and plenty of fun had along the way.\nL104: \nL105: \u301066\u2020My Little Pony\u3011 was not one of the first-activated settings, nor was it one \nL106: even considered in the initial genesis of the Loops. However, it has become \nL107: particularly important to the revival version of the Infinite Loops as presented\nL108:  by Saphroneth and those provoked by him, largely because it is the MLP Loops \nL109: which originally got Spacebattles involved.\nL110: \nL111: The MLP Loopers tend to be good friends, partly because this is the series' name\nL112:  and a core part of their setting, and partly because it is distinct from the \nL113: original Innortal iteration of the Loops. As such, the theme of the MLP Loops \nL114: could be said to be \"don't be unkind\" - though this is a goal in-universe and \nL115: not one which is met every time - and that the Pony Loopers have a tendency to \nL116: want to help the admins, rather than seeing them as obstacles. Apart from that, \nL117: the main feature of the MLP Loops is sheer scale owing to their long-standing \nL118: nature and the general popularity of the setting. (That and how they're mostly \nL119: ponies.)\nL120: \nL121: Aside from revitalizing the Infinite Loops project, the MLP Loops have also \nL122: provided the strong backbone for the revival and as such have had a very \nL123: considerable impact. Several other Loops settings got their genesis via a \nL124: crossover with the MLP Loops, as did a number of Loopers, and more than one \nL125: Anchor originated in a Loop written originally under the aegis of the MLP Loops.\nL126: \nL127: The MLP Loops can be found \u301067\u2020here\u2020www.fimfiction.net\u3011 and \nL128: \u301068\u2020here.\u2020www.fanfiction.net\u3011 The thread is so long it's been broken into parts:\nL129:  \u301069\u20201\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \u301070\u20202\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \nL130: \u301071\u20203\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \u301072\u20204\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \nL131: \u301073\u20205\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \u301074\u20206\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \nL132: \u301075\u20207\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \u301076\u20208\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \nL133: \u301077\u20209\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011 \u301078\u202010\u2020forums.spacebattles.com\u3011\nL134: \nL135: * * *\nL136: \nL137: ## The MLP Loops provide examples of:\nL138: \nL139:   * \u301079\u2020Acid Reflux Nightmare\u3011:\nL140:     * Variant in 136.6, where it's not food that causes it - instead, Twilight \nL141: remembers why it's a bad idea to watch \u301080\u2020The Godfather\u3011 right before bed.\nL142:     * In 143.5, Rainbow Dash thinks she's in one of these (it's really a prank \nL143: by Spike) when she sees a werewolfified reflection of herself in the mirror, and\nL144:  promptly swears off eating Manexican food before bed.\nL145:   * \u301081\u2020Actually Pretty Funny\u3011: In one Loop, Princess Celestia woke up to find \nL146: Nightmare Moon standing over her, and was almost immediately on the receiving \nL147: end of a \"Royal Canterlot Belly Zerbert\".

As such, the theme of the MLP Loops \nL114: could be said to be \"don't be unkind\" - though this is a goal in-universe and \nL115: not one which is met every time - and that the Pony Loopers have a tendency to \nL116: want to help the admins, rather than seeing them as obstacles. Apart from that, \nL117: the main feature of the MLP Loops is sheer scale owing to their long-standing \nL118: nature and the general popularity of the setting.
