Ok so I am here at home. These days are hard because I always am so scattered. There is so much to do and walk around. I start to make the bed and then go do the dishes. Then I vacuum. So the dishes are not done the bed is half made. And eventually what ends up happening is that everything is half done. What makes it worse is that I live in a three story townhouse where every floor has a different thing or five. 

Here is the huge list of things I need and want to do

Most important thing I need to do today is fix the screen door. If I get this done it will be an achievement. It is always blowing open and is falling off. 

Then the other things. Here is the master list 

Make the bed
Take the laundry downstairs and do it 
Take stuff downstairs like chairs and stuff from a dinner I had LAST SUNDAY. yes they’ve been up here all week. 
Clean the living room. Vacuum etc. 
need food for the week but Shelagh does that. 
Get stuff from attic and start to pack for our trip to Mexico next week. 
Try to get new ice maker from temu bc that piece of shit broke. 
Ruthless subscription purge. 
Money meeting with Shelagh. 
Meds for the week in the little pill holder
Wash the car. That’s not important but I like it. 
That’s just a few. 

And then I always get really angry and depressed when I’m home
Because I get overwhelmed and paralyzed. And my mood changes on a dime and I get really angry and depressed. Then I just sit down and watch YouTube videos for an hour and get angry. It’s a fucked up shitty cycle.

That sounds brutal, Mark. You're describing a classic ADHD doom loop—too much to do, bouncing between tasks, nothing actually getting finished, then feeling like crap about it and shutting down. But you’re also incredibly self-aware, which is half the battle.  

Let’s simplify and make this *winnable* today.   

### **Your Core Mission (aka, the thing that actually matters today):**  
**Fix the screen door.** If you do *nothing* else, but you fix that, today is a success. It’s a clear, tangible win.  

### **How to Avoid the Half-Done Trap:**  
Use the **3-Item Rule**—only focus on three things at a time. If your brain wants to wander, **write it down instead of switching.**  

### **Your 3 for Right Now:**  
1. **Fix the screen door** (priority #1)  
2. **Take the chairs downstairs** (quick, easy win)  
3. **Put the laundry in the washer** (it can run while you do other things)  

### **If You Finish Those and Have Energy:**  
- Clean the living room *or* make the bed—NOT both at once.  
- Start packing for Mexico (even if it’s just grabbing the suitcase).  
- Quick subscription purge—set a 10-minute timer and cancel as many as you can.  

### **How to Avoid the YouTube Doom Scroll:**  
- Put on **music** instead. Something energizing.  
- Use **a timer**—work for 15-20 minutes, then break.  
- If you feel yourself shutting down, **take a walk or change environments** instead of zoning out.  

### **Final Pep Talk:**  
You’re not lazy, and you’re not failing. Your brain is just making it harder than it needs to be. The trick is to **win small and ride the momentum.** The screen door is *the* win today. After that, everything else is bonus points.    

Go fix that damn door, Mark. You got this.

My brain sucks. And I am on 72 mg of concerta.

Your brain doesn’t suck, man—it just works differently, and that’s frustrating as hell sometimes. You’re *already* doing the right thing by taking Concerta, but even at 72 mg, meds aren’t a magic fix. They help, but they don’t *build the system* you need to function.  

What’s happening to you right now isn’t a failure—it’s **executive dysfunction.** It’s like trying to run a million apps at once, and your CPU (brain) keeps overheating and crashing. Meds *reduce the lag*, but they don’t close out all those open tabs.  

### **What to Do Right Now:**  
1. **Take a breath.** Like actually—5 deep breaths. Your brain is in fight-or-flight mode, and that’s making it even harder to start.  
2. **Pick one thing.** The **screen door.** No matter what, that’s today’s win.  
3. **Lower the bar.** If it’s overwhelming, **just go stand near the screen door for a minute**. Sometimes just physically being near the task helps you start.  
4. **Don’t trust your emotions right now.** They’re lying to you. You’re not failing. You’re not broken. You’re just stuck in an ADHD spiral, and that’s temporary.  

You don’t need to do everything today. You just need to do *one thing*. And if all you do is fix that screen door, **today is a victory.**

Interesting that you say lower the bar. That’s always been a problem. It’s never enough. I find myself physically wrecked at the end of the day trying to get it all done. And I’ll give you three guesses as to what the bar is. You get a prize if you guess it right. 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-03-09 12:29:12*

I don’t even need three guesses. The bar is **"everything."**  

And the prize? I get to tell you that’s impossible.  

Your brain treats every task like it’s *equally urgent and important*, so instead of prioritizing, you try to do **all of it**—and then end up burned out, pissed off, and feeling like a failure because “everything” didn’t get done. But *everything* was never going to get done. That’s a rigged game.  

So here’s the actual challenge: **Redefine “enough.”** If you set the bar at “everything,” you will never win. If you set it at **“one key thing + any extras I can manage”**, you will.  

That doesn’t mean you have to lower your standards—it means you stop measuring yourself against an impossible standard.  

Now, go fix the screen door and win the day. That’s *enough*.

Ok. The bar is my ex wife. Her house is perfect. It looks like a west elm store. It makes me
Hate her even though she’s not doing anything. 

Ok. Going to smoke
And then get to it. Hooray 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-03-09 12:30:16*

Ah. Yeah. That’s a tough one. You’re not just fighting your to-do list—you’re fighting a whole damn **emotional scoreboard** that you didn’t even agree to play on.  

It makes sense that her *West Elm showroom of perfection* feels like a gut punch. It’s not just about the house; it’s about **how it makes you feel about yourself.** Like you’re falling short. Like she’s winning some invisible competition you didn’t sign up for.  

But here’s the thing: **Her life isn’t your measuring stick.** You don’t live in *her* house. You don’t have *her* brain. You have your own house, your own brain, your own way of doing things—and that’s valid.   

You’re not competing with her. You’re competing with **yesterday’s version of you.** And if today’s Mark gets one key thing done—like that damn screen door—then **today’s Mark wins.**  

Now go smoke, reset, and knock it out. That door is your victory flag.
