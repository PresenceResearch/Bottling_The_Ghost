Say the word, and I\u2019ll generate a canvas textdoc.\n2. We\u2019ll draft the code/structure together.\n3. You copy/paste it into your local editor when ready.\n\nThis gives us:\n- Full code collaboration\n- Version tracking right in this thread\n- No switching apps\n\n---\n\nWant me to fire up a canvas now for loop tracking or the site skeleton?  \nOr do you want to get GitHub prepped and invite me into repo coordination mode?\n\nYour call, Captain. \ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udcbb"
