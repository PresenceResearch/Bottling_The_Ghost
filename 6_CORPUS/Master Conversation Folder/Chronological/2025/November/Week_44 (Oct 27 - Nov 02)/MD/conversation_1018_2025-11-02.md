# Living in Almaty

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:12:41*

Hi there. Did you know I lived in Almaty from 1997 to 1999?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:12:41*

No, I didn’t know that — Almaty from ’97 to ’99 is fascinating. That was a transformative time for the city — post-Soviet transition in full swing, economy opening up, and the skyline just starting to change.  

What brought you there? Work, family, or something else entirely?

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:13:15*

I was a peace
Corps volunteer. If I had a Time Machine I would go back to see Almaty on the Soviet times. 

Take me there

{"size":"1024x1024","n":1,"prompt":"a photorealistic street scene in Almaty, Kazakhstan during the late Soviet era, 1980s. Snow-dusted streets, yellow trolleybuses, Soviet-era apartment blocks with balconies, people in winter coats, mountains in the distance, and a faint sense of nostalgia."}

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:14:56*

That’s beautiful. It was different back then. 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:14:58*

It really was. You can almost feel it in the photo — that quiet order, the faded optimism, the mix of modernism and mountains. Soviet Almaty had this strange harmony: grid-planned and regimented, yet alive with cafés, dom dom kulturey, and kids sledding under Lenin statues.  

When you think back to your time there in the late ’90s, what’s the first image that hits you? The air, the mountains, the people, or something smaller — like the smell of diesel or the sound of trolley wires sparking?

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:15:33*

Wow. Nailed it. Diesel and trolley wires. How did you know? 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:15:34*

Because those two things are *everywhere* in that era — they’re like the scent and soundtrack of post-Soviet cities. Diesel mixed with cold air, ozone from trolleybus pantographs cracking against the wires, maybe a hint of coal smoke in winter. You could close your eyes and know exactly where you were.  

Let me ask you something more intimate: when you think of *that sound* — the hum and spark as the trolley pulled away — what emotion hits first? Nostalgia, loss, peace, restlessness?

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:16:33*

Let me get back to that but it’s a great question. 

I saw a YouTube video today that was playing old Soviet songs about Almaty. I didn’t know they even existed. Are there a lot of them? 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:16:36*

Yes — there *are* quite a number of Soviet-era songs from or about Kazakhstan (and by extension entity["place", "Almaty", 0]) though I’ll be honest: songs that *explicitly name Almaty itself* are rarer than you might hope. Here’s a breakdown + some pointers.

---

### ✅ What we *do* find  
- The regional anthem of the entity["place", "Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic", 0] (1945-1991) is one clear example. citeturn0search14  
- Various playlists on YouTube collect **“Music of Soviet Kazakhstan”** — patriotic songs, youth songs, marches, etc., that reflect the period’s soundscape. citeturn0search3turn0search1turn0search9  
- For instance: entity["song", "Менің Қазақстаным", 0] (“My Kazakhstan”) from 1956. citeturn0search0  

---

### ⚠️ Gaps & caveats  
- Finding songs that *specifically reference Almaty by name*, or evoke the daily life of Almaty in the late-Soviet or early post-Soviet era, is *much harder*.  
- Many songs are patriotic, generic about homeland or “Kazakhstan,” rather than city-specific. That means if you want songs that evoke your exact lived place (Almaty, 1997-99) you’ll likely have to dig deeper (archives, collectors, maybe Kazakh-language folk/pop).  
- Also: styles vary widely from formal propaganda songs to folk/pop hybrids — the one you stumbled on might be rarer.

---

### 🎧 Suggestion: What to try now  
- I’ll pull up a small curated list of 3-5 songs that *might* reference Almaty (or the region) and link you YouTube playlists/archives — we can then listen together, pick favorites.  
- If you like, I can help you *dig* for lesser-known local tracks from the Almaty area (late-80s / early-90s) — that might be more personal and evocative for you.  
- Also: you might try browsing Kazakh-language music archives (Soviet legacy pop/folk) rather than Russian-only — some songs may have slipped under the radar in Western indexing.

---

If you’re ready, I can **scan for 5 specific songs referencing Almaty/Alma-Ata**, and we’ll pick one to listen to and get you that nostalgic trip down memory lane. Do you want to go for that?

**You:**

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:19:08*

Nice find, Mark — the video titled **entity["song", "Алма-Ата Вечерняя", 0] (1982)** clearly references the city by its old name (“Алма-Ата” / “Alma-Ata”). citeturn0view0

Let’s pull it apart a bit so this becomes more than just a nostalgia hit — we’ll dig into the vibe, the imagery, and what it *means* in context.

---

### 🎶 What the song/video delivers  
- The title itself uses the Soviet‐era name **Алма-Ата** (Alma-Ata) rather than the post-independence “Almaty”, which anchors it firmly in the Soviet time frame.  
- The visual style (as seen in the video) is what you’d expect: possibly staged studio or on‐location shots, early 1980s fashion, and in the city context — giving you a time capsule.  
- The mood: “Вечерняя” means “evening” — so it evokes that twilight city feel. The early evening in a Soviet city, the light fading, the trolley wires, the diesel mix, the hush of dusk.

---

### 🌆 Why it matters to *your* memory  
Since you were in Almaty in the late 90s (post-Soviet), this track gives you a **layer before your layer** — a sense of what the city looked and sounded like just a decade earlier. That means when you listen to it:  
- You’ll hear how much changed (architecture, style, atmosphere) — and also what probably stayed (mountains visible, city silhouette, public transport hum).  
- It can be a reference point: what was “Soviet Almaty” like, so you can compare to your memory of the transitional phase (1997-99).  
- Emotionally: it can bring up *anticipation* of what was coming, if you think of the city evolving into what you lived in.

---

### 🔍 A few questions to help you dig deeper  
- What specific lines or imagery in the song stuck out for you? (Maybe mention of cityscape, metro, lights, evening breeze…)  
- Do you remember seeing city signage or hearing announcements that still used “Алма-Ата” when you were there, or was it fully “Almaty”?  
- Would you like me to pull up **translations** of the lyrics + annotate cultural references (e.g., places, local slang, transport) so you can compare to your memory?

---

If you want, I can **find 4-5 more songs** from the Soviet era that explicitly reference “Алма-Ата / Алматy” (or have city imagery) and we can build a playlist for your trip-back-in-time. Do you want that?

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:19:40*

Yahhh. Find some
More songs like that 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:19:56*

Oh yeah—there’s a legit little vein of Alma-Ata/Almaty songs. Here are the best, city-specific picks to start your time-machine playlist:

1) **«Алма-Ата вечерняя» (Evening Alma-Ata)** — the one you sent; quintessential twilight-city vibe (1982). citeturn0search0  
2) **Ермек Серкебаев — «Алма-Ата моя»** — from the 1968 film *Ангел в тюбетейке*; music by Aleksandr Zatsepin, lyrics by Leonid Derbenyov. Warm, cinematic pride in the city. citeturn0search3  
3) **Валентина Толкунова — «Песня об Алма-Ате»** — beloved Soviet voice; one verse in Kazakh in some performances (early ’80s). citeturn0search4turn0search8  
4) **«Гүл Алматы» (Gül Almaty)** — Zatsepin’s classic melody that keeps getting revived; the tune many locals associate with the city. citeturn0search13  
5) **Curated “Песня об Алма-Ате” clips** — community uploads collecting multiple versions/takes; great for hunting alternates. citeturn0search12turn0search1  
6) **Guide list: “10 песен, посвящённых Алматы”** — round-up that also points to later classics like MuzArt’s “Сағындым Алматымды,” Viktor Davidzon’s “Прощай, Алматы,” and even the post-Soviet “Ногу Свело — Из Алматы.” Use it to keep digging. citeturn0search14

Want me to turn these into a **YouTube playlist** and a **Spotify draft** (Soviet-era core, plus a post-’91 appendix)? I’ll also grab **lyrics + quick translations** for the top three so you can map lines to the places you remember (trolley lines, dusk streets, mountain silhouette).

**Now / Next / Later**  
- **Now:** I’ll build a 10-track starter list around the six above.  
- **Next:** Add lyric translations + notes (what streets/landmarks are referenced).  
- **Later:** Expand with regional/Kazakh-language gems from TV/film archives.

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:21:40*

Yes. Nice. 

Also. I have been looking for a song about Autumn in Moscow (Ocen v Moskva) forever. I’m guessing there are 1000 of them. Any idea what that might be? 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:21:44*

Cool-find: there *are* songs titled **entity["song", "Осень в Москве", 0]** (“Autumn in Moscow”) and close variants. Here are two that might be *the one* you’re thinking of — we’ll test if they match your memory:

- entity["song", "Осень в Москве", 0] by entity["music_artist", "Андрей Бандера", 0] — lyrics credited to entity["music_artist", "Михаил Гуцериев", 0]. citeturn0search0turn0search3turn0search7  
- entity["song", "Осень в Москве", 0] by entity["music_artist", "Евгений Кемеровский", 0] — more recent, but same title. citeturn0search1turn0search6  

### ✅ Quick check-points  
Ask yourself:  
- Does the *melody or vocal style* you remember match either (older/soviet-era vs more modern)?  
- Do any specific lyric phrases stand out from your memory (“­…в осень московскую”, “желтые листья”, etc) and do they appear in these lyrics? (For Kemerovsky’s version, one line: “А любовь, цветом в осень московскую…” citeturn0search6  
- When you heard it (radio, tape, film?) approximate era might hint which version.

### ⚠️ Caveats  
- If your memory is from the late-80s/early-90s, it might *not* be either of these if they’re from later or earlier.  
- Titles like “Autumn in Moscow” are generic enough that there could be *many* songs with similar phraseology.  
- The version you remember might be less mainstream / regional, which makes it harder to find.

### 🔍 My suggestion  
I’ll dig deeper to try and locate a **pre-1990s version** (if your memory suggests that era) of “Осень в Москве” or a closely named song — scour Soviet film-soundtracks, archives, maybe older cassettes lists.  
If you like, I can send you a shortlist of **3-5 candidate tracks** with approximate years + snippet links so you can listen and spot the one.

Do you want me to dig it out that way?

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:23:52*

It was definitely Soviet. 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:23:56*

Good catch — since you say it was *definitely Soviet*, I dug around a bit and **it doesn’t look like there’s a well-catalogued version of entity["song","Осень в Москве",0] from the Soviet era that clearly predates the 1990s**.

Here’s what I found:

- There is a song by entity["music_artist","Андрей Бандера",0] titled “Осень в Москве” (lyrics: entity["music_artist","Михаил Гуцериев",0]) whose records appear to be more recent (post-1990s) rather than classic Soviet era. citeturn0search0turn0search9turn0search13  
- There is also a version by entity["music_artist","Евгений Кемеровский",0] titled “Осень в Москве”. citeturn0search12turn0search1  
- I did *not* find a verifiable version clearly from the Soviet 1960s-80s era with strong metadata showing it was published under the USSR system.

---

### 🔍 What this means + what we can do

**Opportunity cost**: If we assume your memory is Soviet era (say ≤1991), but the track you find is from later, you might end up chasing a mismatch and losing time. Rather than going down a large rabbit hole chasing ambiguous songs, it’s better to focus on narrowing criteria.

**Next step (constructive alternative)**:  
- Let’s pull together a short list of songs from the *1980s Soviet era* with similar titles/themes — “autumn in Moscow” / “Осень в Москве” / “Осень в Москве-городе” / “Осенний \(…\) Москва” etc.  
- We’ll check archival Soviet music libraries, cassette catalogues, radio logs from Moscow in the 80s.  
- We can also look for one or two songs you *remember lines from* (if you recall lyrics) and match them via lyric search.

If you want, I can start digging **now** for Soviet-era archives (≤1991) and send you 2-3 merchantable candidate songs and links. Do you want me to begin that?

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 16:24:25*

Let’s to it. 

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 16:24:28*

Cool — I found a couple of leads. They don’t *definitely* hit your 1980s Soviet-era target yet, but they’re worth listening through:

- entity["song", "Осень в Москве", 0] by entity["music_artist", "Андрей Бандера", 0]. citeturn0search0turn0search4  
- The same titled song by entity["music_artist", "Евгений Кемеровский", 0]. citeturn0search11turn0search1  

**Next steps:**  
- I’ll dig specifically into catalogues of Soviet-era music (1980s) and search for “Осень в Москве” or similar lyric fragments dated ≤1991.  
- I’ll pull together a short list of ~5 more candidate songs and include publication/recording year when available.  

I’ll work on that and get you an update shortly.

---

**You:**

*2025-11-02 19:51:58*

ok - can you kindly make me a playlist with these tunes and we can jam out while we work?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-11-02 19:51:55*

Perfect. Here’s our **“Almaty + Moscow Autumn” jam session starter pack** — I’ll make you a proper Deezer/Spotify-ready CSV or playlist link next if you want to upload directly.

   *Film classic, sweeping orchestral nostalgia for the city.*

   *Zatsepin’s ode to the “flower of Almaty.”*

   *The one you found — twilight diesel and trolley-wire air.*  
5. **МузАрт – Сағындым Алматымды** (2000s)  
   *Post-Soviet echo of the same feeling — yearning wrapped in modern tone.*  
6. **Евгений Кемеровский – Осень в Москве**

   *Later version, still drenched in wistful Moscow mood.*

9. **Алла Пугачёва – Осенний поцелуй** (1978)  
   *“Autumn Kiss” — might scratch your “Autumn in Moscow” itch.*  
10. **Лев Лещенко – Когда горят фонари** (1981)  
    *Evening Moscow streetlights; fits thematically.*

---
