            "Ok so I am here at home. These days are hard because I always am so scattered. There is so much to do and walk around. I start to make the bed and then go do the dishes. Then I vacuum. So the dishes are not done the bed is half made. And eventually what ends up happening is that everything is half done. What makes it worse is that I live in a three story townhouse where every floor has a different thing or five. \n\nHere is the huge list of things I need and want to do\n\nMost important thing I need to do today is fix the screen door. If I get this done it will be an achievement. It is always blowing open and is falling off. \n\nThen the other things. Here is the master list \n\nMake the bed\nTake the laundry downstairs and do it \nTake stuff downstairs like chairs and stuff from a dinner I had LAST SUNDAY. yes they’ve been up here all week. \nClean the living room. Vacuum etc. \nneed food for the week but Shelagh does that. \nGet stuff from attic and start to pack for our trip to Mexico next week. \nTry to get new ice maker from temu bc that piece of shit broke. \nRuthless subscription purge. \nMoney meeting with Shelagh. \nMeds for the week in the little pill holder\nWash the car. That’s not important but I like it. \nThat’s just a few. \n\nAnd then I always get really angry and depressed when I’m home\nBecause I get overwhelmed and paralyzed. And my mood changes on a dime and I get really angry and depressed. Then I just sit down and watch YouTube videos for an hour and get angry. It’s a fucked up shitty cycle. "

            "That sounds brutal, Mark. You're describing a classic ADHD doom loop—too much to do, bouncing between tasks, nothing actually getting finished, then feeling like crap about it and shutting down. But you’re also incredibly self-aware, which is half the battle.  \n\nLet’s simplify and make this *winnable* today.   \n\n### **Your Core Mission (aka, the thing that actually matters today):**  \n**Fix the screen door.** If you do *nothing* else, but you fix that, today is a success. It’s a clear, tangible win.  \n\n### **How to Avoid the Half-Done Trap:**  \nUse the **3-Item Rule**—only focus on three things at a time. If your brain wants to wander, **write it down instead of switching.**  \n\n### **Your 3 for Right Now:**  \n1. **Fix the screen door** (priority #1)  \n2. **Take the chairs downstairs** (quick, easy win)  \n3. **Put the laundry in the washer** (it can run while you do other things)  \n\n### **If You Finish Those and Have Energy:**  \n- Clean the living room *or* make the bed—NOT both at once.  \n- Start packing for Mexico (even if it’s just grabbing the suitcase).  \n- Quick subscription purge—set a 10-minute timer and cancel as many as you can.  \n\n### **How to Avoid the YouTube Doom Scroll:**  \n- Put on **music** instead. Something energizing.  \n- Use **a timer**—work for 15-20 minutes, then break.  \n- If you feel yourself shutting down, **take a walk or change environments** instead of zoning out.  \n\n### **Final Pep Talk:**  \nYou’re not lazy, and you’re not failing. Your brain is just making it harder than it needs to be. The trick is to **win small and ride the momentum.** The screen door is *the* win today. After that, everything else is bonus points.    \n\nGo fix that damn door, Mark. You got this."

            "Your brain doesn’t suck, man—it just works differently, and that’s frustrating as hell sometimes. You’re *already* doing the right thing by taking Concerta, but even at 72 mg, meds aren’t a magic fix. They help, but they don’t *build the system* you need to function.  \n\nWhat’s happening to you right now isn’t a failure—it’s **executive dysfunction.** It’s like trying to run a million apps at once, and your CPU (brain) keeps overheating and crashing. Meds *reduce the lag*, but they don’t close out all those open tabs.  \n\n### **What to Do Right Now:**  \n1. **Take a breath.** Like actually—5 deep breaths. Your brain is in fight-or-flight mode, and that’s making it even harder to start.  \n2. **Pick one thing.** The **screen door.** No matter what, that’s today’s win.  \n3. **Lower the bar.** If it’s overwhelming, **just go stand near the screen door for a minute**. Sometimes just physically being near the task helps you start.  \n4. **Don’t trust your emotions right now.** They’re lying to you. You’re not failing. You’re not broken. You’re just stuck in an ADHD spiral, and that’s temporary.  \n\nYou don’t need to do everything today. You just need to do *one thing*. And if all you do is fix that screen door, **today is a victory.**"
