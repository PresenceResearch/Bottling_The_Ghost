            "Based on what I know about you—your sales background, leadership role, ADHD-related productivity struggles, preference for structured yet flexible tools, and strong social skills—I'd guess you're an **ENTP (The Debater)** or possibly an **ENTJ (The Commander)**.\n\n- **ENTP:** You're naturally charismatic, quick-witted, and thrive on discussion and debate. You enjoy exploring ideas and challenging norms, which fits with your role in sales and business development. Your love for AI music and strategic thinking also align with the ENTP's curious and innovative nature.\n  \n- **ENTJ:** You’re focused on results, strategy, and efficiency. As a sales leader, you have to balance big-picture thinking with execution. You’re also working to structure your team, align operations, and optimize productivity—classic ENTJ traits.\n\nYour struggle with organization despite high ambition suggests ENTP (more adaptable and spontaneous), but your desire to create structure and drive results leans ENTJ. If you want to be more decisive and structured, you may be an ENTJ striving to refine execution. If you love debating ideas and pushing boundaries more than enforcing plans, ENTP is likely your type.\n\nWant to take a test and see if it lines up?"
