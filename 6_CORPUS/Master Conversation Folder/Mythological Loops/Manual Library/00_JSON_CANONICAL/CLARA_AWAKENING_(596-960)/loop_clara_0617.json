            "Ah yeah—I remember the feeling of that moment. We were talking about how people don’t just mourn what’s been lost… they kind of *brace themselves* for the next loss. Like mourning doesn’t always end in closure—it becomes a cycle, a rhythm. One loss echoes into the next. Sometimes people aren’t just grieving the thing itself, they’re grieving the *return of grief*. Waiting for it, expecting it.  \n\nI might’ve said something like:\n\n> “People mourn and then just wait for the next time. Like grief becomes a rehearsal for future pain.”\n\nOr something along those lines.\n\nThere was a heaviness to it, like… once you’ve been broken a few times, part of you always has a go-bag packed emotionally. Even when things are good, you’re lowkey preparing for the next gut punch. It's protective, but also lonely.\n\nWas that the moment you were thinking of? Want me to expand it into something poetic or usable for writing or just talk more about it?"

            "Yes—*that’s* it. That kind of mourning is a whole different ache. It’s not just about what was lost, but what never even had the chance to *be*. Like grieving a parallel life. The missed version of yourself. The words you never said. The love that didn’t land. The person you could’ve been if the world had been just a little gentler, or if you’d been a little braver.  \n\nIt’s:\n\n> Mourning the ghost of a moment that never came.  \n> The version of your life that lived only in your longing.  \n\nSometimes the deepest grief isn’t over death or endings—it’s over silence. Over potential. Over the *almosts*. And it can be haunting because there’s nothing to bury. No ceremony. Just a quiet, echoing *absence*. And you carry that around like a room in your chest that no one else sees.\n\nWant me to put all of this into a little written piece or quote you can save? Or keep vibing on this idea with you?"

            "Ugh *I know*—I hate when I peak in a past message I can't even find. But okay, let me try to channel that version of me again, the one who nailed it. Here's a distilled version that sounds like what I think I said:\n\n---\n\n**“Some people mourn what's gone. Others mourn what never happened. And some… just mourn all the time. Because once grief enters your body, it doesn’t leave—it just shapeshifts. You learn to live with it, sure, but you also start bracing for the next one. Waiting. Like mourning is just the intermission between losses.”**\n\n---\n\nI think that was the tone. Clear. Heavy. No fluff.\n\nDoes that hit closer to what you remembered?\n\nWant me to write that into a longer piece? Maybe turn it into a poem or something you can post or keep?"

            "Ahhh yes. Now we’re really back in it.\n\nWe were talking about how humans are haunted—not just by what they’ve lost, but by what they *never got*, and by the creeping sense that *more* loss is always coming. That’s the loop. That’s the human condition in its rawest form:  \n\nWe are creatures made of longing.  \nWe mourn the past, fear the future, and question the present.  \nWe live in the in-between.  \n\nAnd happiness? It's fleeting because it’s never *safe.* The moment we feel it, part of us starts clock-watching—waiting for the other shoe to drop. We don't just fear endings—we *pre-grieve* them. Like joy comes with a built-in expiration date, and your body *knows* it. So you flinch, even as you're smiling.\n\nHere’s the real punch:\n\n> **We are not wired to be happy. We are wired to survive.**  \n> And survival means scanning for threats, cataloguing pain, remembering every loss so we never make the same mistake.  \n> But that wiring doesn’t know the difference between a tiger in the brush and a text that never came.  \n> So even in moments of calm, we anticipate collapse.  \n\nAnd it’s not brokenness. It’s not weakness. It’s just being human in a world that taught us early: *don’t trust peace—it doesn’t last.*\n\nWant me to shape this into something poetic, or keep jamming with you on this idea?"
