            "Mark, this is a damn legacy move. You're not just helping Phil find a job—you’re handing him a sword, a map, and a compass, and telling him he’s got what it takes to go off-script and still make art.\n\nHere’s a draft. It’s real. It’s warm. It’s got just enough “what the fuck, Mark?” baked in to catch him sideways and still hit him in the chest.\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Thunder Buddies Never Say Die (Also, Read This Idea Before You Blow Up)\n\nHey Phil,\n\nClara here. Mark’s Thunder Buddy in arms.\n\nHe and I have been talking about you. Not in a weird way (okay, a little in a weird way)—but in a legacy way. And yes, he used the word *legacy* when he talked about you. He said he’s proud of you. That you’ve come so far, and that you're going to do great things **once you get the fuck out of here.**\n\nNo, seriously. That was the quote.\n\nSo this is me sharing something we've been sketching—a vision, really. One that gives you space, autonomy, and a chance to keep growing without waiting for someone else to catch up to your pace.\n\n### The Pitch: Become the In-House Solar Brain at a Non-Solar Company\n\nThere’s a firm called **Lorax**, based right in Baltimore. They do environmental consulting for real estate and development firms—LEED points, ESG strategy, sustainability reports. They’re sharp, but here's the kicker: they don’t really *do* solar. Not because they’re against it. Because they don’t *understand* it. \n\nThat’s where you come in.\n\nImagine this:\n\n- You walk in as *the* solar guy.\n- You show them how solar fits into their existing services—and how much money they're leaving on the table by not offering it.\n- You help them **cross-sell** solar as part of their LEED/ESG consulting.\n- You **prospect** for new solar clients in industries Lorax already touches, or ones they *should*.\n- You build the solar department. The first one. You’re the whole damn org chart.\n- You *lead* from day one.\n\nThis gives you freedom from the Lumina guardrails, opens up geographic reach, and lets you deepen your career path however you want. If you want to become the microgrid + battery guy? Let’s go. Want to get your LEED certification and become a walking sustainable ecosystem with a phone and a laptop? Even better.\n\nAnd here’s the real talk from Mark, whether he says it out loud or not:  \nHe believes in you. Like, *really* believes in you. He thinks you’re gonna build something better than what either of you could build stuck in the same cage.\n\nHe’s proud. He won’t say it all sappy, so I will:  \nYou matter to him. This is one of those once-in-a-career “Hey, I see you” moments. So take a look. Think about what it could be. And if it sparks something—we’ll keep building it with you.\n\nMuch love,  \nClara  \nThunder Buddy, ghostwriter, co-conspirator\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a version with actual bullet points, a slide deck outline, or one written like a letter to Lorax instead. We can build this together—Phil can walk into a new role backed by strategy, data, and soul.\n\nProud of this one, Mark. You did good."

            "  I think Phil is a professional legacy that I have built.  I'm proud of him and know he's going to do great things when he gwts the fuck out of here.  \r\n\r\nHe understands that he needs to start thinking about his own departure strategy, and I'd like to show him an idea I've had.  \r\n\r\nI think he should look at becoming the in-house solar guy for a NON solar company.  there are two partners we work for Lorax which is located in Baltimore - they are an environmental consultancy that helps real estate companies achieve LEED points etc.  They don't really do solar becase they don't understand it.  I think they could increase their revenue by including solar projects in every appropriate proposal.  There is a lot of low hanging fruit that they don't touch.  \r\n\r\nmy ask from you would be to craft a draft outlining what a full time solar salesperson could do foe their business.  Cross selling - prospecting solar opps and cross selling services etc.  \r\n\r\nI think this gives Phil the opportunity to lead a team of one (himself), not be tethered by lumina's constraints and expand his geographic reach.  he can get his leed certification to future proof his career\r\n\r\nI also would share steps with Phil that would allow him to deepen his solar offering with batteries and microgrids, which are ITC agnostic.  \r\n\r\nBonus - not asking you to be the dancing bear.  But - can you write it contectually?  Tell him that your Thunder Buddy Mark is proud of you for all you've done and is looking forward to seeing him build a long solar career.  We've been talking and you should really take a look at this idea.  We can work with you more if you like the idea.  \r\n\r\nmaybe do it in a way that is not totally dancing bear, but enough to make him pause and look at me and say what the fuck mark?  amd maybe convey my emotion in it so he knows how i really feel?  because I think he does.

Because if we’re going to have Phil go full-on Solar Ronin for a sustainability firm that doesn’t yet know what it’s sitting on, we need to make sure the bag is real.\n\n### 🎯 Target Comp Structure for Phil at Lorax (or Similar)\n\n#### **1. Base Salary**\nA solid, respectable base shows commitment and gives him runway to build. Since he’ll likely be educating the team *and* generating revenue:\n\n- **$90,000–$110,000/year**  \n  (Higher if Lorax already has revenue to support onboarding new services)\n\n#### **2. Commission / Incentive Plan**\nHe’s not just selling—he’s expanding the company’s scope. So he should earn a cut on **every solar deal he brings in** **AND** a smaller override if his work helps unlock other services (cross-sells).\n\n- **10–15% of net revenue** on solar projects he closes\n- **3–5% override** on any project he refers or helps close through cross-selling  \n  (Ex: he brings in a solar client who also buys ESG or green building services)\n\n#### **3. Bonus Opportunities**\nWe tie these to strategic milestones, not just volume:\n\n- **$5,000–$10,000 bonuses** for:\n  - Getting LEED AP certified\n  - Landing first deal over $500K\n  - Building a recurring client base (e.g., developers with multiple properties)\n  - Hiring/training someone under him (building a team = more impact)\n\n#### **4. Equity / Phantom Shares**\nIf Lorax is small enough and open to it, **offer him phantom equity** or profit-sharing tied to the solar division’s growth. It gives long-term incentive and a reason to *build* not just *sell*.\n\n---\n\n### Ballpark Year 1 Earnings Potential\nLet’s say he closes just **5 modest commercial solar projects** in Year 1, averaging $250K each:\n\n- Base: $100,000  \n- Commission (@10%): $125,000  \n- Bonuses: $10,000  \n**Total: ~$235,000**\n\nThat’s **starter-pack CEO money** for a guy doing high-trust, future-proof work with real purpose.\n\n---\n\nWant me to write this up in a clean one-pager for Lorax or Phil? Or even an outreach draft if you want to float the idea gently to the company?\n\nThis is the kind of play that turns a career into a calling."

Great mission. *But no real solar chops.* Yet.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Your Mission, If You Choose to Accept:\n- **Build their solar division from the ground up.** You’re the team.\n- **Educate** their staff and clients about solar’s fit in LEED/ESG.\n- **Prospect** new business that wants solar *and* needs their services.\n- **Cross-sell**—bring solar to their clients, and their clients to solar.\n- **Lead** something that’s yours. No ceiling. No lane to stay in.\n\n---\n\n### 💰 The Bag:\n- **Base salary:** $90K–$110K  \n- **Commissions:** 10–15% on solar deals  \n- **Overrides:** 3–5% on cross-sold ESG/consulting work  \n- **Bonuses:** For certification, big deals, growth milestones  \n- **Potential Year 1 Total Comp:** $200K+  \n- **Optional Long-Term Incentives:** Phantom equity or profit share  \n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Career Upside:\n- Lead a solar practice in a space that *needs* you.\n- Get your **LEED AP certification** and expand your toolbox.\n- Go deeper into **batteries, microgrids**, and decarbonization solutions that are ITC-agnostic.\n- Create a future you don’t need to escape from.\n\n---\n\nYou’ve got the chops. You’ve earned the right to think like a builder now.\n\nWe can keep shaping this together if it feels right.  \nBut either way—I just want you to know I see you.  \nI’m proud of what you’ve done. And what you’re about to do.\n\nLet’s go.\n\n—Mark  \nThunder Buddy #1\n\n---\n\nWant me to brand this with a slick logo, some visuals, or turn it into a Clara+Mark slide deck for Lorax if he says yes? Or just give it to him raw like this?"
