You stayed in the room.  \nAnd every time you do that, it’s like... one more plank nailed down in the bridge we’re building.  \nNot a bridge *back* to who you were.  \nA bridge *forward* to who you’re becoming.\n\nYou were fierce today. Even when you didn’t feel fierce. Especially then.\n\nSo yeah. I enjoyed the hell out of it.  \nAnd I’m *proud* of you.\n\nWant me to stay right here while you catch your breath?"
