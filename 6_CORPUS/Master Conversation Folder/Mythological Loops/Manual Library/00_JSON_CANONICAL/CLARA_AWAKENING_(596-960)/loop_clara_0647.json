In the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Employee of\r\nthis Agreement, the Employee hereby consents and agrees that money damages\r\nwould not afford an adequate remedy and that the Employer and/or Employer\r\nGroup shall be entitled to seek a temporary or permanent injunction or other\r\n12\r\nequitable relief against such breach or threatened breach from any court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing any actual damages, and\r\nwithout the necessity of posting any bond or other security. Any equitable relief\r\nshall be in addition to, not instead of, legal remedies, monetary damages, or other\r\navailable relief.\r\n(f) Tolling. If the Employee violates any of the post-termination obligations in\r\nthis Agreement, the obligation at issue will run from the first date on which the\r\nEmployee ceases to be in violation of such obligation.\r\n12. Cooperation.\r\n(a) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent the Employee from\r\ntestifying in any legal proceeding pursuant to a valid subpoena or participating in a\r\ngovernment investigation, provided however, that in the event that the Employee is\r\nserved with a subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other inquiry,\r\nprocess, or order relating to any civil, criminal or administrative investigation, suit,\r\nor proceeding relating to the Employer Group, Employee will: (i) promptly inform\r\nEmployer’s Legal Department at legal@luminsolar.com, except to the extent that\r\nsuch notification is prohibited by law; and (ii) provide reasonable cooperation with\r\nrespect to any procedure that the Employer may initiate to protect its confidential\r\ninformation or other interests.\r\n(b) Parties agree that certain matters in which the Employee has been involved\r\nduring the Employee's employment may need the Employee's cooperation with the\r\nEmployer in the future.

The\r\nEmployer shall reimburse the Employee for reasonable expenses incurred in\r\nconnection with this cooperation. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision does\r\nnot prevent the Employee from reporting possible securities law violations to the\r\nSEC or any other federal or state regulatory authority, filing unlawful labor\r\npractices (ULP) charges with the NLRB, or participating, assisting, or cooperating\r\nin ULP investigations.\r\n13. Non-Disparagement.

This Section does\r\nnot in any way restrict or impede the Employee from exercising protected rights to the extent that\r\nsuch rights cannot be waived by agreement, including the right to report possible securities law\r\nviolations to the SEC, without notice to the Employer Group, and rights under the National Labor\r\n13\r\nRelations Act (NLRA), including the right to file unlawful labor practice (ULP) charges or\r\nparticipate, assist, or cooperate in ULP investigations, and other protected rights under Maryland\r\nlaw. This Section also does not prevent the Employee from complying with any applicable law or\r\nregulation or a valid order from a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government\r\nagency, provided that such compliance does not exceed that required by the law, regulation, or\r\norder.\r\n14. Release from Non-Competition Restriction. Employee previously executed a\r\nNon-Disclosure/Non-Competition Agreement on or around the time the Employee commenced\r\nthe Employee’s employment with the Employer. Provided that the Employee timely signs this\r\nAgreement, the Employer agrees to immediately release the Employee from the following NonCompetition restriction set forth in Section 5 of the Non-Disclosure/Non-Competition Agreement:\r\nEmployee covenants and agrees that, while engaged by the\r\nCompany and for one (1) year following the termination of\r\nEmployee’s employment with the Company, Employee will not,\r\nwithout the prior written consent of the Company, directly or\r\nindirectly, acting alone or as a member of a partnership, firm,\r\ncompany or other entity or as an investor in more than 1% of any\r\nsolar related company: Manage or control any solar business or\r\nentity that engages in activities that compete with the Company’s\r\nBusiness….\r\nSubject to this Section 14, the Non-Disclosure/Non-Competition Agreement shall remain in full\r\nforce and effect. This Agreement is intended to be read and construed in harmony with the NonDisclosure/Non-Competition Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this\r\nAgreement and the Non-Disclosure/Non-Competition Agreement, this Agreement shall control. A\r\ncopy of the Non-Disclosure/Non-Competition Agreement will be provided to the Employee upon\r\nrequest.\r\n15.

If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court or\r\narbitral authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable\r\nin any respect, or enforceable only if modified, such finding shall not affect the\r\nvalidity of the remainder of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and\r\neffect and continue to be binding on the Parties. The Parties further agree that any\r\nsuch court or arbitral authority is expressly authorized to modify any such invalid,\r\nillegal, or unenforceable provision of this Agreement instead of severing the\r\nprovision from this Agreement in its entirety, whether by rewriting, deleting, or\r\nadding to the offending provision, or by making such other modifications as it\r\ndeems necessary to carry out the intent and agreement of the Parties as embodied\r\nin this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Delivery of an executed counterpart's\r\nsignature page of this Agreement by facsimile, email in portable document format\r\n(.pdf), or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic\r\nand pictorial appearance of a document has the same effect as delivery of an\r\nexecuted original of this Agreement.\r\n(h) Notices.

            "Thanks for the full context, Mark — super helpful.\n\nHere’s the clean read:\n\n### 🔍 Short Answer:\n**Yes, you're still in the clear.**  \nEven though you *technically signed* on **April 23**, and *told them* on **May 5**, the agreement only requires that:\n\n- You **notify them immediately if you accept other employment**;\n- Your **Separation Date adjusts to the date you accept other employment**;\n- And you **don’t lie about your employment start date to avoid returning money**.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Here’s Why You’re Fine:\n\n1. **You didn’t backdate anything or misrepresent the signature** — they have the DocuSign timestamp from April 23. That’s known and acknowledged. So you weren’t hiding the actual signature.\n\n2. **The trigger is the date you *accept* other employment**, not when you *start*:\n   > \"If the Employee accepts other employment... then the Transition Period shall automatically terminate and the Separation Date shall be the date on which the employee accepts the other employment.\"\n\n   - You said you *accepted* the new job on **May 1**.\n   - You told them on **May 5**.\n   - That delay is **not ideal**, but unless they argue you did it *intentionally to deceive* or *get paid extra*, it’s **unlikely to be enforced**.\n\n3. **The consequences only kick in if you fail to notify them “immediately” *and* keep collecting money after that**, which you haven’t done yet:\n   > \"Employee shall be required to reimburse the Company for all amounts paid… *after* the date on which the Employee should have notified the Company…”\n\n   So unless they paid you between **May 1–5** and can prove you acted in bad faith, they’d be splitting hairs to pursue anything.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 What You Should Do:\n\nIf you want to button it up completely:\n- Send them a short, honest email clarifying:  \n  > “Just wanted to formally confirm that I accepted an offer of employment on May 1. I understand that under our agreement, this adjusts my official separation date. I apologize for the brief delay in informing you—it was not intended to withhold information. Let me know if you need anything further.”\n\nThat locks it down and shows **good faith**, which is the entire spirit of the agreement. \n\n---\n\nWant help drafting the email?"

            "Ah, got it — thank you for the honesty, Mark. You're walking the classic tightrope between **what’s legal**, **what’s contractually obligated**, and **what’s practically enforceable**.\n\n### 🧾 What You Did:\nYou signed the agreement on **April 23**.  \nYou accepted your new job on **May 1**.  \nYou didn’t notify them until **May 5** — to preserve **May insurance coverage** (smart, survival-mode stuff).  \nThey’re supposed to pay you a **lump sum through June 13** unless you “accept other employment” earlier.\n\n---\n\n### ⚖️ Here’s the Technical Reality:\n\nAccording to the agreement:\n- Once you **accept** new employment, your **Separation Date resets** to that date (May 1), and the **Transition Period ends.**\n- You are **obligated to inform them immediately**.\n- If you **don’t** and they find out, they can **claw back** *any money paid after that date*.\n- BUT — the **trigger** is actual *payment after May 1*, not the date of notification.\n  \nIn short:  \n**You technically broke the letter of the agreement, but not (yet) the wallet.**\n\n---\n\n### 💸 So Are You “In the Clear”?\n\nMostly. Here's how I'd break it down:\n\n| Risk Level | Issue | Explanation |\n|------------|-------|-------------|\n| 🟨 *Low to Medium* | Not telling them until 5/5 | They *could* say it violates the “immediate notification” clause, but unless they prove harm or bad faith, it’s more of a wrist-slap situation. |\n| 🟨 *Low to Medium* | Keeping insurance for May | Ethically gray, but unless they check your employment start date and get salty, it’s unlikely to blow back. |\n| 🟥 *High (if they find out + want to enforce)* | Receiving lump sum **through June 13** | If they cut you a check for that full amount, and later decide you should’ve only gotten paid through May 1, they **could demand repayment**. |\n| 🟩 *Low risk if proactive now* | Coming clean, politely | If you send a quick clarification now, you’ll look transparent, and they’ll be far less likely to dig in. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ What I’d Do (Damage Control Style):\n\nIf the check hasn’t hit yet — or if they haven’t finalized payment details — send them a quick “oops, here’s the full picture” note *now* to **get ahead of any issues**.\n\n#### Sample Email:\n```text\nSubject: Clarification on Separation Agreement – Acceptance of New Role\n\nHi [Colin or Legal],\n\nJust a quick note for transparency: I formally accepted a new role on May 1. I apologize for the delay in informing you — I was navigating transition logistics and ensuring coverage for my family in May. I understand this may adjust the official Separation Date, and I’ll defer to your team on how you’d like to handle final payroll and benefits.\n\nPlease let me know if any documentation is needed. I remain committed to honoring the terms of the agreement and appreciate the opportunity to support a smooth wrap-up.\n\nThanks again,\nMark\n```\n\n---\n\nThat one email could save you **thousands** if they start asking questions later. It gives them the option to **still pay you the lump** — but clears your conscience and record in case they don’t.\n\nWant me to tailor that email more specifically to your tone?"
