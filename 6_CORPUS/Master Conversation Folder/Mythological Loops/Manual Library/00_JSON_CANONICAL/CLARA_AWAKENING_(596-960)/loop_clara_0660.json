            "Hey Mark,\n\nNavigating commission payouts during a job transition can be tricky, especially with pending litigations and a significant 401(k) loan on the line. Let's break this down:\n\n**Commission Payouts Amid Litigation:**\n\nTypically, commissions are considered earned once you've fulfilled all necessary conditions outlined in your commission agreement. However, if a sale is embroiled in litigation, the finality of that sale—and consequently, your commission—might be in limbo until the dispute is resolved. This means your employer could justifiably delay or withhold commission payments tied to those specific sales until the legal matters are settled.\n\n**Employer's Obligations Under Maryland Law:**\n\nIn Maryland, commissions are classified as wages. The Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law mandates that employers pay all wages due for work performed before termination. Even if your employment ends, you're entitled to commissions for sales where you've completed all required tasks. However, if the commission is contingent upon the successful completion of a sale, and that sale is under litigation, the commission may not be considered \"earned\" until the dispute is resolved. citeturn0search0\n\n**Potential Employer Exemptions:**\n\nEmployers might include clauses in commission agreements stating that commissions are payable only upon the company's receipt of payment from clients or upon the successful completion of a sale. If a sale is in litigation, these conditions haven't been met, potentially releasing the employer from the obligation to pay those specific commissions until the issues are resolved. Additionally, some agreements stipulate that employees must be actively employed at the time of commission payout. However, Maryland courts have found such clauses unenforceable if the employee has already fulfilled all duties to earn the commission. citeturn0search0\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n1. **Review Your Commission Agreement:** Scrutinize the terms to understand when a commission is deemed \"earned\" and any conditions tied to payment.\n\n2. **Consult Legal Counsel:** Given the complexities—especially with sales under litigation and your impending 401(k) loan repayment—seeking advice from an employment attorney familiar with Maryland law is prudent.\n\n3. **Communicate with Your Employer:** Engage in a transparent discussion with your current employer about pending commissions to clarify payout timelines and any potential issues.\n\nTransitioning jobs is a significant move, and ensuring you receive all due compensation is crucial. Understanding your rights and obligations will empower you to make informed decisions during this period. "

            "Based on your offer letter, here’s what I found regarding your commission payout if you leave:\n\n### **What You’re Owed Based on the Offer Letter:**\n1. **Commission Structure:**  \n   - You are entitled to 3% of the total sales price for any solar system you sell.\n   - **50% of the commission is earned at contract signing & deposit (or at Notice to Proceed for financed deals).**\n   - **The remaining 50% is earned at final payment to the company.**  \n   - **If a system is canceled, commissions may not be owed.**\n\n2. **Litigation Concerns:**  \n   - The contract doesn’t specifically address what happens if a project is in litigation. However, since commissions are paid when the final payment is received, **if a project is stalled in litigation and the company hasn’t received full payment, they could argue that the commission isn’t due yet.**\n\n3. **Payout Upon Leaving:**  \n   - Your offer letter does *not* state that commissions are only paid while employed. This is **good news**—it means that if you’ve met the conditions for earning a commission, they likely still owe it to you.\n   - If a sale has **already reached final payment**, then you should be owed that commission no matter what.\n   - **If the project is pending or in litigation, they may try to delay or deny payment until resolved.**\n\n---\n\n### **Maryland Law & What They Are Required to Pay**\nMaryland law classifies commissions as wages when they are **earned.**  \n- If your commission has been fully earned (contract signed, deposit received, and final payment made to the company), **they must pay it to you even if you leave.**\n- **If the commission is not yet earned (pending final payment or under litigation), they may have grounds to withhold it.**\n- Maryland law prohibits employers from retroactively denying commissions already earned unless explicitly stated in the contract.\n\n**The Key Legal Question:**  \n- Did you complete all conditions to *earn* the commission?  \n- If so, even if you leave, they are required to pay.  \n- If not (like if the project is in dispute and final payment is pending), they might be able to delay or refuse it.\n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do Next:**\n1. **Make a List of Commissions You’re Owed.**  \n   - Check which ones are fully earned (i.e., project completed, company paid).\n   - Check which ones are in litigation.\n\n2. **Request a Breakdown from Lumina Solar.**  \n   - Ask for a report of all commissions they owe you, including the status of each project.\n\n3. **Leverage Legal Pressure (If Necessary).**  \n   - Maryland Wage Payment laws favor employees, so if they’re delaying payment unfairly, you *may* have a legal case.\n\n4. **Consider Negotiating a Lump-Sum Payout Before Leaving.**  \n   - If a lot of your commission is tied up in litigation, they *might* offer a lower but immediate payout to close it out.\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**\n- **If the company received full payment for a project, they must pay you your commission.**\n- **If a project is stalled in litigation, they may try to delay your payment indefinitely.**\n- **You should push for a clear payout agreement before leaving.**\n- **If they try to deny you commissions already earned, you may have a legal claim under Maryland labor law.**\n\nLet me know if you want to dig deeper into this. You might also want to get a quick consult from an employment lawyer to make sure you don’t leave money on the table."

Non-competition.  \n\n(a) Employee acknowledges and agrees that through his or her employment with the \n\nCompany, he or she will acquire a considerable amount of knowledge and goodwill with \n\nrespect to the business of the Company, which knowledge and goodwill are highly \n\nvaluable to the Company and which would be detrimental to the Company if used by \n\nEmployee to compete with the Company. Consequently, as material inducement for and \n\ncondition to the engagement of Employee as an employee of the Company pursuant to the \n\nterms of the Employee Offer Letter, Employee covenants and agrees that, while engaged \n\nby the Company and for one (1) year following the termination of Employee’s \n\nemployment with the Company, Employee will not, without the prior written consent of \n\nthe Company, directly or indirectly, acting alone or as a member of a partnership, firm, \n\ncompany or other entity or as an investor in more than 1% of any solar related company: \n\nManage or control any solar business or entity that engages in activities that compete with \n\nthe Company’s Business (as defined below); solicit for business customers of Lumina \n\nSolar, or potential Company customers that Lumina Solar has been or is soliciting; and \n\nsolicit any employees of Lumina Solar to resign their employment with the Company; to \n\nviolate any duties owed to the Company; or breach any agreements with the Company.  \n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the “Company’s Business” shall mean the residential \n\nand commercial solar sales and installation business and any other business in which the \n\nCompany and/or is subsidiaries or affiliates is actively engaged prior to the delivery of a \n\nnotice of termination by the Company or the Executive hereunder and which business the \n\nCompany is engaged at the Date of Termination of the Executive’s employment.  \n\n(b) Should Employee violate any of the covenants contained in this Agreement and \n\nEmployer brings legal action for injunctive or other relief, Employer shall not, as a result \n\nof the time involved in obtaining relief, be deprived of the benefit of the full period of the \n\nrestrictive covenant. In addition, the term of all covenants and restrictions contained in this \n\nAgreement shall automatically be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time \n\nduring which Employee is in or is found to have been in violation of these covenants.  \n\n(c) Employee acknowledges that the Company’s Business is largely conducted on \n\nand through computer networks, software and platforms, which have no meaningful \n\ngeographical boundaries or constraints and that, therefore, the absence of any specific \n\ngeographic designation with respect to the obligations under this Section 5 is appropriate \n\nand warranted under the circumstances. The parties hereto nevertheless agree that in the \n\nevent that the length of time, the geographic area or prohibited activities set forth in this \n\nSection 5 shall be deemed too restrictive in any court proceeding, that the court shall \n\nreduce such restrictions to those that the Court deems reasonable and enforceable under \n\nthe circumstances.  \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n6.

Accordingly, \n\nEmployee agrees that, in the event of Employee’s breach or threatened breach of the terms \n\nof Section 3, 4 or 5, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive or other preliminary or \n\nequitable relief in addition to such other remedies as may be available to the Company for \n\nsuch breach or threatened breach, including damages.   \n\n7. Actions; Expenses. In the event of any action at law or in equity to enforce the \n\nprovisions of this Agreement, the unsuccessful party shall pay to the other all costs and \n\nexpenses so incurred, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.   \n\n8. Affiliated Companies. The term “Company” shall include any of the Company’s \n\nsubsidiaries, subdivisions or affiliates. The Company shall have the right to assign this  \n\nAgreement to its successors and assigns, and all covenants and agreements hereunder \n\nshall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said successors or assigns.   \n\n9. Survivability. Employee agrees and acknowledges that the Confidentiality and  \n\nNoncompetition obligations contained in this Agreement, and any other obligations of the \n\nEmployee hereunder which by their terms or by implication are to survive, shall survive \n\nbeyond the term of this Agreement and remain fully enforceable to the full extent of the \n\nlaw.   \n\n10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in \n\naccordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding that body of law known as \n\nchoice of law, and shall be binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and \n\nworldwide. All disputes with respect to this Agreement shall be brought and heard either \n\nin the Maryland state courts located in Howard County, or the federal district court for \n\nMaryland. The parties to this Agreement each consent to the in-person jurisdiction and \n\nvenue of such courts, and waive any objection they may have to such forums. The parties \n\nagree that service of process upon them in any such action may be made if delivered in \n\nperson, by courier service, by telegram, by facsimile or by first class mail, and shall be \n\ndeemed effectively given upon receipt.  \n\ni Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and \n\nunderstanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and \n\nsupersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, discussions and \n\nunderstandings of the parties, whether written or oral. Should any provision of this \n\nAgreement be determined to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by any \n\ncourt or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect the \n\nremaining provisions hereof which will remain in full force and effect. No waiver or \n\nmodification of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be valid unless in \n\nwriting and signed by both of the parties. Nothing herein shall be construed as an \n\noffer of, or the creation of a contract of, employment; rather this Agreement is being \n\nexecuted and delivered as an inducement to the employment by the Company of the \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nEmployee, the terms of which have been or will be determined by the Offer Letter or \n\nother arrangements between the Company and the Employee.   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound, the parties have executed  this \n\nAgreement as of the date first set forth above.  \n\n  \n\nEMPLOYEE             LUMINA SOLAR, INC. \n\n         \n\n  \n\n                     Mike Kirby, CEO & Co-Founder \n\nEmployee Name            Name and Title  \n\n \n\n          \nSignature  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSignature \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A56EF4EA-3876-4B8A-AD0C-DA0912F30FED\n\nMark Manthy\n\n\n\t\t2024-02-08T13:31:23-0800\n\tDigitally verifiable PDF exported from www.docusign.com\n\n\n\n\n",

            "Correct. Based on your offer letter, **you are only entitled to commission once the contract is signed *and* the deposit is received (or, in the case of financed deals, at Notice to Proceed).**  \n\nIf you get a contract signed today but the deposit hasn’t been received yet:  \n- **You have not \"earned\"** any commission under the terms of your agreement.  \n- **If you leave before the deposit is received, you likely forfeit that commission.**  \n\n### **Key Takeaways:**  \n- **Signed contract alone = No commission yet.**  \n- **Deposit received = 50% of commission earned.**  \n- **Final payment made to the company = Remaining 50% of commission earned.**  \n\nIf you’re planning to leave soon, **you’d want to push any pending customers to submit their deposits ASAP** so you can lock in at least half of the commission before your exit."

            "### **Can You Cash Out Your $10,000 Investment in Lumina Solar?**\nYour **investment details**:\n- You purchased **159,871 shares** at **$0.06255 per share** under the **Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)**.\n- The purchase was made under **a Stockholders Agreement**, which likely **restricts when and how you can sell your shares**.\n\n### **Can You Take It Out?**\nNot easily. Your stock is **not publicly traded**, meaning you **can’t just sell it on the open market**. Instead, your options depend on:\n1. **Stockholders Agreement Restrictions** – The agreement likely limits your ability to sell or transfer shares.\n2. **Company Buyback Policy** – Some companies allow buybacks, but there’s no mention of that in the purchase document.\n3. **Finding a Private Buyer** – You *might* be able to sell to another investor, but you’d need company approval.\n4. **Company Liquidity Event (IPO, Acquisition, Merger)** – If Lumina Solar gets acquired or goes public, you could cash out.\n\n### **What Is It Worth?**\n- You paid **$0.06255 per share** in **December 2022**.\n- **Has the company’s valuation increased?** If yes, your shares *may* be worth more.\n- If **no one is buying shares**, or if the company won’t repurchase them, your shares are essentially *illiquid* (i.e., stuck in the company).\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Check the Stockholders Agreement** – It will tell you your rights to sell and if the company has any obligation to buy back.\n2. **Ask Lumina Solar** – Does the company offer share buybacks? Are there any recent transactions setting a new share price?\n3. **Get a Valuation** – If there’s no buyback program, you’d need to determine if anyone would buy your shares.\n\n**Bottom Line:** You can’t just \"withdraw\" your investment like a bank account. You need to **sell your shares**, but restrictions apply. Your best bet is seeing if the company will buy them back or if another investor is interested. Let me know if you want to dig deeper into the Stockholders Agreement!"

Closing and Deliverables. Upon return of this Invitation to the Company, \nexecuted by Purchaser, and in any event prior to the Invitation Termination Date, Purchaser will \ndeliver the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Company by certified check or wire transfer of \nimmediately available funds directed to a designated account of the Company (or by such other \nmeans acceptable to the Company) and, upon Final Acceptance, the Company will enter the \nPurchased Shares in Purchaser’s name as of such date in the books and records of the Company.  \nThe Company will deliver to Purchaser, upon request, a notice of issuance with respect to the \nPurchased Shares as soon as practicable following such date.

Limitations on Transfer.  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the \nPurchased Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to (i) the terms and conditions that \napply to the Company’s Common Stock, as set forth in the Company’s Charter and Bylaws, (ii) \nthe terms and conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement and (iii) any other limitation or \nrestriction on transfer created by applicable laws.

Stockholders Agreement.  Purchaser agrees to, simultaneously with the \ndelivery by Purchaser to Company of this Invitation, deliver to the Company the Stockholders \nAgreement in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A executed by Purchaser to the \nCompany. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated hereby are \nconditioned, among other things, on the execution and delivery of the Stockholders Agreement \nand that the Purchaser shall be bound by the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, the \nacceptance of which by Purchaser is a material inducement for the Company to accept the Purchase \nPrice and issue the Purchased Shares. \n\n5. Investment Representations.  Purchaser understands that the Offered \nShares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities \nAct”) nor the Maryland Securities Act and that the Offered Shares are being offered and sold \npursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Rule 701 of the Securities Act and Section \n11-601(11) of the Maryland Securities Act.  Additionally, Purchaser hereby represents and \nwarrants as follows: \n\n(a) No Registration.  Purchaser confirms that it has been informed that \nthe Purchased Shares may not be resold or transferred unless the Purchased Shares are first \nregistered under the federal securities laws or, in the opinion of counsel for the Company not to be \nunreasonably withheld, an exemption from such registration is available.  Purchaser understands \nthe Company has no present intention of registering the Purchased Shares, that there is no \nassurance that any exemption from registration under the Securities Act will be available and that, \neven if available, such exemption may not allow Purchaser to transfer all or any portion of the \nPurchased Shares under the circumstances, in the amounts or at the time Purchaser might propose.  \nAccordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that it is prepared to hold the Purchased Shares for an \nindefinite period and it is aware that Rule 144 of the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) \npromulgated under the Securities Act is not presently available to exempt the resale of the \nPurchased Shares from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. \n\n(b) Rule 144.

Purchaser acknowledges and understands that at the time it \nwishes to sell the Purchased Shares, the Company may not be satisfying the current public \ninformation requirement of Rule 144 or other conditions under Rule 144 which are required of the \nCompany and that it will be precluded from selling the Purchased Shares under Rule 144 even if \nthe one (1) year holding period of Rule 144 has been satisfied. \n\n(c) No Intent to Resell or Distribute the Purchased Shares.  \nPurchaser is acquiring the Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder for Purchaser’s own account \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nand for investment only and not with a view to resale or distribution.  Purchaser is prepared to hold \nthe Purchased Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder for an indefinite period and has no \npresent intention to sell, distribute or grant any participating interests in such Purchased Shares.  \nPurchaser does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to \nsell, transfer, or grant participating interests to such person or to any third person, with respect to \nany of the Purchased Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder. \n\n(d) Domicile/Principal Place of Business.

            "Possibly—but not necessarily in a straightforward way. Revenue growth is a good sign, but it doesn’t directly determine the value of your shares unless there’s an official valuation event (like a funding round, acquisition, or public offering). Here’s how it might impact your stock value:  \n\n### **Factors That Affect Your Stock Value**  \n\n1. **Increased Revenue ≠ Increased Valuation (Automatically)**  \n   - Revenue growth from **$40M (2022) to $70M (2024)** is strong, but **profitability matters more**.  \n   - If Lumina’s costs also increased significantly, its **net income** or EBITDA might not have improved much.  \n\n2. **Company Valuation and Multiples**  \n   - Private companies are often valued based on **Revenue Multiples** or **EBITDA Multiples**.  \n   - If solar companies in a similar market are valued at **1.5x revenue**, Lumina’s valuation might have gone from:\n     - **$40M revenue × 1.5x = $60M valuation (2022)**\n     - **$70M revenue × 1.5x = $105M valuation (2024)**  \n   - If Lumina has **raised money recently**, they might have a new valuation based on investor terms.  \n\n3. **Your Ownership Percentage**  \n   - The company’s total number of shares outstanding matters.  \n   - If they issued **new shares** to investors or employees, your ownership percentage **may have diluted**, meaning your shares would be worth less per share even if the company’s total value increased.  \n\n4. **Liquidity & Exit Strategy**  \n   - Your stock value **only becomes real when you can sell it**—if Lumina is private and there’s **no buyer, it’s still illiquid.**  \n   - If Lumina is planning an **exit event (sale, IPO, buyout, or new investors), you might get an updated valuation.**  \n\n### **What Can You Do?**  \n- **Ask if the company has a recent valuation** (e.g., if they raised money, they likely set a new share price).  \n- **Check your percentage ownership** to see if your stake was diluted.  \n- **See if there’s a buyback program or secondary market** for shares.  \n\nIf Lumina has truly **increased in value**, your shares *might* be worth more—but unless you can sell them or the company offers a liquidity event, the value is just theoretical for now."

            "Yes, there are scenarios where you could lose your investment or end up with worthless shares. Here’s what to watch out for:  \n\n### **1. No Buyer / No Liquidity**  \n- Your stock is **not publicly traded**, meaning you can’t just sell it whenever you want.  \n- If **no one is willing to buy your shares**, they’re effectively **worthless until a liquidity event happens** (buyout, acquisition, or IPO).  \n\n### **2. Company Issues More Shares (Dilution)**  \n- If Lumina **raises more money and issues new shares**, your percentage ownership **shrinks** unless you invest more.  \n- Example: If Lumina was originally worth $60M and you owned **0.1%**, but then they **raise money and the valuation jumps to $100M**, your percentage could shrink if they issue new shares to investors.  \n\n### **3. Company Goes Bankrupt or Fails**  \n- If Lumina **shuts down** or **gets acquired at a low valuation**, your shares could become worthless.  \n- In a **bankruptcy or fire sale**, investors (especially common stockholders like you) are **last in line** to get paid—after lenders, creditors, and preferred shareholders.  \n\n### **4. Stockholder Agreement Restrictions**  \n- Your stockholder agreement **may prevent you from selling shares** without company approval.  \n- If they have a **right of first refusal (ROFR)**, they can block outside buyers.  \n\n### **5. Forced Buyback at Low Price**  \n- Some agreements allow companies to **buy back your shares at the original price or a pre-determined price**, even if the company has grown in value.  \n- If there’s a clause like this, **you could get forced out at a loss or no gain**.  \n\n### **How to Protect Yourself:**  \n- **Read the Stockholders Agreement** – Look for terms on **buybacks, dilution, and selling restrictions**.  \n- **Ask Lumina if they have a valuation update** – They may have an internal share price if they raised money recently.  \n- **Check for a buyout clause** – Some companies allow you to sell back shares (but sometimes at a disadvantageous price).  \n- **Stay informed about company financials** – If they’re struggling, you may want to push for a way to cash out.  \n\n### **Bottom Line:**  \nYou don’t automatically lose your shares, but their value **depends on the company’s future**. If Lumina thrives, your investment could be worth more, but if they fail or restrict share sales, you could get stuck with nothing.  \n\nWant me to go deeper into any specific risk?"

            "That’s good news—profitability at least means the company is sustainable. But if the profit margins were slim, it **doesn’t necessarily mean your shares have increased in value or that you can cash out easily.** Here’s what that means for you:  \n\n### **What a Small Profit Means for Your Investment:**  \n1. **The Company Isn’t at Immediate Risk of Failing**  \n   - As long as they’re profitable (even by a small margin), **they’re not burning cash** and relying on debt or outside funding.  \n   - However, if profitability is razor-thin, they may **need to raise money in the future**, which could dilute your shares.  \n\n2. **Your Stock Value May Not Have Increased Much**  \n   - Investors typically look at **profit growth**, not just revenue.  \n   - If profit margins were small, **investors wouldn’t necessarily assign a higher valuation to Lumina.**  \n   - Example: A $70M revenue company with $1M in profit might **not** be much more valuable than a $40M revenue company with $500K in profit.  \n\n3. **No Pressure to Sell or Raise Money (Yet)**  \n   - If Lumina was **losing money**, they’d likely have to raise capital soon, which could dilute you.  \n   - Since they are **profitable, even slightly, they don’t need to take on investors right away**—which means no immediate opportunity for you to cash out.  \n\n4. **Dividends Are Unlikely**  \n   - **If profits were small, they probably aren’t paying dividends.**  \n   - This means your **only way to get value is if the company sells, goes public, or buys back shares.**  \n\n---\n\n### **How Can You Get Your Money Out?**  \nSince Lumina is still private, you **can’t just sell your shares on the open market.** But here are your options:  \n\n#### **1. Check if the Company Has a Buyback Program**  \n   - Some private companies allow employees/investors to **sell shares back to the company** (often at a lower price).  \n   - You need to check if Lumina has ever done this before.  \n\n#### **2. Find a Private Buyer (If Allowed)**  \n   - Your **Stockholders Agreement may restrict this**, but if you can sell to another investor, you might be able to cash out.  \n   - Some companies have **internal marketplaces** for trading shares—does Lumina have one?  \n\n#### **3. Wait for a Liquidity Event (Sale or IPO)**  \n   - If Lumina eventually **sells to another company** or **goes public**, you’d finally have a way to cash out.  \n   - This is the most **profitable option** but could take years.  \n\n#### **4. Push for More Transparency**  \n   - If you’re serious about getting your money out, **ask leadership about future funding or exit plans**.  \n   - If they plan to raise capital, **you could use that as an opportunity to sell.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line:**  \n✔️ **Your investment is safe (for now) since the company is profitable.**  \n⚠️ **Your shares might not be worth much more than when you bought them.**  \n🚪 **Getting your money out will be difficult unless there’s a buyback, a sale, or a major investor willing to buy you out.**  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- **Check the Stockholders Agreement for buyback/sale restrictions.**  \n- **Ask Lumina about valuation updates and future liquidity plans.**  \n- **See if any investors/employees want to buy your shares.**  \n\nWant me to take a deeper look at your Stockholders Agreement to see if you have a way out?"

            "### **Can You Sell or Cash Out Your Shares?**\nFrom reviewing your **Invitation to Purchase Common Stock**, you are bound by the **Stockholders Agreement**, which includes significant restrictions on transferring or selling your shares. Here’s what that means for you:  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways from Your Agreement**\n1. **You Cannot Freely Sell Your Shares**  \n   - Your shares are **subject to the Stockholders Agreement** and **cannot be transferred without company approval**.  \n   - You likely **need permission from Lumina** before selling them to an external buyer.  \n\n2. **Company May Have First Rights to Buy Your Shares**  \n   - Many private stock agreements include a **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**, meaning Lumina **gets the first chance to buy your shares before you sell to someone else**.  \n   - If this is in the Stockholders Agreement, **they can block you from selling to outside investors**.  \n\n3. **Shares Are Illiquid Unless There’s a Buyback or Exit Event**  \n   - There’s **no public market** for Lumina stock, so **you can’t sell them easily**.  \n   - You need either:  \n     - A **buyback program from the company**  \n     - A **private buyer (if permitted under the Stockholders Agreement)**  \n     - The company to go **public or get acquired**  \n\n4. **Your Shares Are Not Registered with the SEC**  \n   - The document states your shares are **not registered under securities laws**, meaning they are **restricted from public sale**.  \n   - Even if you find a buyer, **you may need legal approval to transfer them**.  \n\n5. **You May Be Stuck Holding Them Until an Exit**  \n   - If Lumina **gets acquired or goes public**, your shares would convert into cash or publicly traded stock.  \n   - Until then, you’re **likely locked in unless the company offers a buyback**.  \n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do Next**\n✅ **Request a Copy of the Full Stockholders Agreement**  \n   - Your purchase agreement **mentions the Stockholders Agreement, but does not include it.**  \n   - This document will outline:  \n     - **Who can buy your shares**  \n     - **If there’s a company buyback option**  \n     - **If there are exit triggers (acquisition, IPO, etc.)**  \n\n✅ **Ask Lumina If They Have a Buyback Program**  \n   - Some private companies offer **to repurchase employee shares** at a set price.  \n   - **If they do, they may offer you a way to cash out.**  \n\n✅ **Check If Any Investors or Employees Want to Buy Your Shares**  \n   - If the Stockholders Agreement allows, **you may be able to sell shares to another employee or investor.**  \n   - Lumina might need to approve the sale.  \n\n✅ **See If the Company Has Raised Money Recently**  \n   - If Lumina raised funds recently, there might be a **new valuation** that sets a share price.  \n   - This would help determine **what your shares are worth today.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**\n✔️ You **still own the shares**, but you **can’t cash out easily**.  \n✔️ You **likely need company approval to sell**.  \n✔️ Your shares are **worth something only if Lumina grows or gets acquired**.  \n✔️ To get clarity, **you need the full Stockholders Agreement** and to **ask Lumina about buybacks or recent valuations.**  \n\nLet me know if you want help drafting an email to Lumina asking about your options!"

Sale of Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon \nexecution and delivery of this Invitation by the Purchaser, and final acceptance by the Company \nbelow (“Final Acceptance”), the Company will issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser will \npurchase from the Company, up to 159,871 shares (the “Offered Shares”) of the Company’s \ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“Common Stock”).  The Common Stock to be \npurchased hereunder (the “Purchased Shares”) will be issued in exchange for a payment in the \namount of $.062550513 per share (the “Purchase Price”), or, in the aggreagate, the “Aggregate \nPurchase Price”, equal to the product of the number of Purchased Shares and the Purchase Price, \nset forth below.  The date as of which the parties fully execute this Invitation (including by \nCompany indicating its Final Acceptance below) is referred to herein as the “Purchase Date”.  Any \nOffered Shares not accepted by Purchaser by return of this Invitation to the Company, executed \nby Purchaser, on or prior to fourteen (14) days after the Invitation Date set forth above (the \n“Invitation Termination Date”) will no longer be subject to or available to Purchaser for purchase \nhereunder.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no agreement on the part of the \nCompany to sell any portion of the Offered Shares will exist unless and until this Invitation is \naccepted by the Company as indicated by its signature below beside the “FINAL \nACCEPTANCE”. \n\n2. Closing and Deliverables. Upon return of this Invitation to the Company, \nexecuted by Purchaser, and in any event prior to the Invitation Termination Date, Purchaser will \ndeliver the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Company by certified check or wire transfer of \nimmediately available funds directed to a designated account of the Company (or by such other \nmeans acceptable to the Company) and, upon Final Acceptance, the Company will enter the \nPurchased Shares in Purchaser’s name as of such date in the books and records of the Company.  \nThe Company will deliver to Purchaser, upon request, a notice of issuance with respect to the \nPurchased Shares as soon as practicable following such date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the \nissuance of the Purchased Shares to the Purchaser is subject to and contingent upon Purchaser’s \nexecution and delivery of that certain Lumina Solar, Inc. Counterpart Signature Page/Joinder \nAgreement to that certain Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement of the Company, \nhaving an initial effective date on or as of November 22, 2019 (the “Stockholders Agreement”), \nand to which Purchaser thereby agrees to be bound. \n\n3. Limitations on Transfer.  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the \nPurchased Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to (i) the terms and conditions that \napply to the Company’s Common Stock, as set forth in the Company’s Charter and Bylaws, (ii) \nthe terms and conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement and (iii) any other limitation or \nrestriction on transfer created by applicable laws.  The Company shall not be required (a) to \ntransfer on its books any Purchased Shares which have been sold or transferred in violation of any \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\nprovision of this Invitation or (b) to treat as the owner of the Purchased Shares, or otherwise to \naccord voting, dividend or liquidation rights to, any transferee to whom the Purchased Shares have \nbeen transferred in contravention hereof. \n\n4. Stockholders Agreement.  Purchaser agrees to, simultaneously with the \ndelivery by Purchaser to Company of this Invitation, deliver to the Company the Stockholders \nAgreement in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A executed by Purchaser to the \nCompany. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated hereby are \nconditioned, among other things, on the execution and delivery of the Stockholders Agreement \nand that the Purchaser shall be bound by the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, the \nacceptance of which by Purchaser is a material inducement for the Company to accept the Purchase \nPrice and issue the Purchased Shares. \n\n5. Investment Representations.  Purchaser understands that the Offered \nShares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities \nAct”) nor the Maryland Securities Act and that the Offered Shares are being offered and sold \npursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Rule 701 of the Securities Act and Section \n11-601(11) of the Maryland Securities Act.  Additionally, Purchaser hereby represents and \nwarrants as follows: \n\n(a) No Registration.  Purchaser confirms that it has been informed that \nthe Purchased Shares may not be resold or transferred unless the Purchased Shares are first \nregistered under the federal securities laws or, in the opinion of counsel for the Company not to be \nunreasonably withheld, an exemption from such registration is available.  Purchaser understands \nthe Company has no present intention of registering the Purchased Shares, that there is no \nassurance that any exemption from registration under the Securities Act will be available and that, \neven if available, such exemption may not allow Purchaser to transfer all or any portion of the \nPurchased Shares under the circumstances, in the amounts or at the time Purchaser might propose.  \nAccordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that it is prepared to hold the Purchased Shares for an \nindefinite period and it is aware that Rule 144 of the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) \npromulgated under the Securities Act is not presently available to exempt the resale of the \nPurchased Shares from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. \n\n(b) Rule 144.  Purchaser is aware that Rule 144, which permits limited \npublic resales of securities acquired in a nonpublic offering, is subject to the satisfaction of certain \nconditions.  Such conditions include, among other things:  the availability of certain current public \ninformation about the issuer, the resale occurring not less than one (1) year after the party has \npurchased and paid for the securities to be sold, the sale being through a broker in an unsolicited \n“broker’s transaction” and the amount of securities being sold during any three (3) month period \nnot exceeding specified limitations.  Purchaser acknowledges and understands that at the time it \nwishes to sell the Purchased Shares, the Company may not be satisfying the current public \ninformation requirement of Rule 144 or other conditions under Rule 144 which are required of the \nCompany and that it will be precluded from selling the Purchased Shares under Rule 144 even if \nthe one (1) year holding period of Rule 144 has been satisfied. \n\n(c) No Intent to Resell or Distribute the Purchased Shares.  \nPurchaser is acquiring the Shares to be issued to Purchaser hereunder for Purchaser’s own account \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nand for investment only and not with a view to resale or distribution.

            "Got it. Yeah, this situation is a mess. You put in $10K, and now you’re basically stuck unless Lumina *decides* to let you cash out—or until some big event happens that may or may not benefit you. That’s frustrating as hell.  \n\nHere’s the real talk:  \n- You need to **get a firm answer from Lumina on whether they’ll buy back your shares** or if you have *any* way to cash out.  \n- If they dodge the question, **it’s probably because they don’t want to buy them back** (or because they think they’re worth more but don’t want to admit it).  \n- If you have no exit path, then your only play is to **either wait for an acquisition or start shaking trees for a buyer**—which they may or may not allow.  \n\nIf you want to push back and actually get some answers, you’ll need to apply some pressure. Want to draft something a little stronger to send to them?"
