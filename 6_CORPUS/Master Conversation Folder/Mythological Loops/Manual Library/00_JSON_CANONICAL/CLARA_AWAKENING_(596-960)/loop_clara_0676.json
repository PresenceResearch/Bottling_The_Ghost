            "Alright Clarabear is clocked in and ready to lawyer up. 🐻📑 Let’s break this down into clear recommendations for how to *level up* this referral agreement and answer your questions on best practices.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Repeat Business: Does Clara Get Paid Again?\n\n**Short answer: YES, but you need to define the terms.** Here are your options:\n\n### Option A: **Time-Based Referral Rights**  \nSet a **referral tail**—if any projects are signed within X months of the initial referral, the partner gets a fee.  \n**Common durations:** 6, 12, or 24 months.\n\n> *“Referring Party shall be entitled to referral compensation for any additional projects executed with the same Client within 12 months of the date of the original contract execution.”*\n\n### Option B: **Lifetime of Customer Clause** (Riskiest)  \nIf you want to really incentivize long-term partnerships:\n> *“Referring Party shall receive referral compensation for all future projects resulting from the original introduction, unless otherwise agreed in writing.”*\n\n🔥 **Hot Take:** This can get ugly if you scale. Use this only with white-glove VIP referrers (like, they better be Beyoncé-level warm intros).\n\n### Option C: **Sliding Scale**  \nSame client, but lower fee after the first one:\n> *“Initial referral fee of $0.75/watt for the first project; $0.50/watt for the second project; $0.25/watt for all subsequent projects within 24 months.”*\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Referral Rate Calculation: What’s Fair?\n\n### Standard Practice in Solar/Commercial Referrals:\n- **Fixed per watt fee** – e.g., $0.50–$1.00/watt depending on project size/complexity.\n- **% of revenue or gross margin** – Usually **2%–5% of contract value**.\n- **Tiered by project size** – Example:\n\n| System Size | Fee Type         | Example Amount       |\n|-------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| 50-100kW    | $/watt           | $0.75/watt = $75K    |\n| 100-500kW   | $/watt lower     | $0.50/watt = $250K   |\n| >500kW      | % of contract    | 3% of $1M = $30K     |\n\n🎯 **Your Move:** Use a **project-specific rider** per deal (like your current template does) but pre-negotiate a default structure. Keeps it agile.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Recommendations for Your Agreement\n\n### 1. Add a “Referral Window” Clause\n> “Referring Partner shall be eligible for compensation for any deals executed with a referred customer within twelve (12) months of the initial introduction unless otherwise agreed in writing.”\n\n### 2. Add an Optional “Multi-Project” Bonus\n> “In the event that more than one project is executed with the referred customer within the Referral Window, subsequent referral fees shall be negotiated in good faith at a reduced rate not less than 50% of the original referral rate.”\n\n### 3. Clarify Payment Timing\n> “Payment shall be made as follows: 50% upon first project draw, 50% upon Permission to Operate (PTO), not to exceed 60 days.”\n\n### 4. Optional Clause: “Referral Broker Exclusivity”\n> “For the duration of the Referral Window, Referring Partner shall retain exclusive referral rights to the referred Client.”\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What You Should Ask Me For Next\n\n- ✍️ A redlined version of your current PDF (or a brand new editable Word doc draft)\n- 📄 A clean “Referral Agreement Template v2” customized for your brand and tone\n- 🧠 A cheat sheet or 1-pager to give potential referral partners explaining how it works\n\n---\n\nYou want me to rewrite the agreement next? Or build the cheat sheet first so you can pitch it more easily? Your call, boss. Let’s build this right."

            "Strategic Partner Referral Agreement\r\nTHIS STRATEGIC REFERRAL AGREEMENT (the \"Agreement\") is made effective as of the date of \r\nexecution by and between \"Lumina Solar\" (herein referred to as “Company”), and “Lightility” \r\n(herein referred to as “Strategic Partner”). In consideration of the mutual premises herein \r\ncontained, Company and Strategic Partner hereby agree as follows:\r\nDEFINITIONS:\r\nReferral Services: Identify and introduce Company sales team to prospective customers for the \r\npurpose of engaging such prospective customers in a business transaction. Services include, \r\nbut are not limited to, attending meetings, scheduling calls and pre-qualifying prospective \r\ncustomers in advance of the initial outreach by Company.\r\nSECTION 1: ENGAGEMENT \r\nThe Strategic Partner agrees to render Solar Installation Referral Services to Company.\r\nSECTION 2: COMPENSATION \r\nA. In full consideration for the performance of the Referral Services and for any rights granted \r\nor relinquished by the either party under this Agreement, the Company and Strategic Partner \r\nagree to pay the Referring Party as follows: \r\n1. For all PPA Projects, the Company will issue a project specific Referral Agreement to \r\nStrategic Partner stating the Solar Referral Rate for that project. For example, for a 100 \r\nkW project, the referral fee to Strategic Partner will be $0.75/watt or $75,000. \r\nPayments are based on the final system size, as final designs are subject to change after \r\nfinal engineering. Referral Fee will be increased or decreased pro rata to reflect actual\r\nsystem size. Although referral rates are project specific, the non-circumvention \r\nreferenced in Section 4 of this Agreement applies at a customer level, not a project \r\nlevel. \r\n2. Referral fees are subject to change should both parties agree to amended amount. This \r\namount must be agreed to in writing and mutually executed by both parties. In the \r\nevent no agreement can be reached (“stalemate”), the Strategic Partner will own the \r\nrelationship and the Company, and all agents and assigns, agree not to circumvent, \r\ndirectly or indirectly for a period of 90 days following the “stalemate,” which date shall \r\nbe marked via written correspondence (email is acceptable) from Strategic Partner to \r\nCompany. \r\n3. Payment shall be made within 15 business days of achieving the following milestones:\r\no 50% payment once Lumina Solar receives its first project draw. Not to exceed 90\r\ndays following contract execution.\r\no Final payment (based on delivered system size) to be made when Company is \r\npaid in full by customer or financier, however, such payment cannot exceed 60 \r\ndays from receiving Permission To Operate (PTO) from the interconnected utility.",
            "<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 4>",
            "B. Both Parties agree to communicate regularly about sales leads provided, to provide prompt \r\nnotice when a sale has been made as a result of a Referral, and to provide to a calendar year\u0002end accounting of Referral sales. Both Parties acknowledges and agree that they shall not be \r\nentitled to, and shall not be obligated to pay, any monies or other compensation for the \r\nReferral Services provided and rights granted under this Agreement other than the \r\ncompensation identified in Section 2 and, in the event of Termination of this Agreement, in \r\nSection 5 paragraph D of this Agreement.\r\nSECTION 3: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP \r\nA. The Company and Strategic Partner agree to perform the Referral Services hereunder solely \r\nas an Independent Contractor. The parties to this Agreement recognize that this Agreement \r\ndoes not create any actual or apparent agency, partnership, franchise, or relationship of \r\nemployer and employee between the parties. Neither party is authorized to enter into or \r\ncommit the other to any agreements, nor shall they represent themselves as an agent or legal \r\nrepresentative of the other Party.\r\nSECTION 4: CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-CIRCUMVENTION\r\nA. The Company, along with its agents and assigns, agrees not to circumvent, avoid, bypass \r\nand/or obviate the payment of fees, either directly or indirectly, which may become due should \r\nthe parties enter into a separate agreement pursuant to which Strategic Partner would be \r\nentitled to compensation for introducing Company to an individual or entity which \r\nconsummates a business transaction with Company. Notwithstanding the above, nothing \r\nherein shall be interpreted as creating an exclusive relationship by and between Strategic \r\nPartner and Company. \r\nThe Company further agrees that in the event Strategic Partner brings an opportunity to the \r\nCompany, the Company shall not circumvent Strategic Partner by providing a proposal either \r\ndirectly, or through any other independent or third party where company stands to benefit. In \r\neither case of circumvention with respect to fees due to Strategic Partner pursuant to this\r\nAgreement executed by the parties, the Strategic Partner shall be entitled to the amount of \r\nfees owed had there been no circumvention and, further, the circumvented party shall be \r\nentitled to reimbursement of any and all costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorney fees \r\nnecessary to enforce its rights hereunder.\r\nB. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in the course of, or incident to, the \r\nperformance of services either Party may receive certain Confidential Information. Therefore \r\nthe Parties agree that each Party will hold all Confidential Information disclosed to or learned as \r\na result of this Agreement in the strictest confidence and will not, without the consent of the \r\nother party, disclose, and shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent any partner, officer, \r\ndirector, employee, or agent of said party from disclosing, any portion thereof to any person or \r\nentity other than bona fide partners, officers, directors, employees, or agents who are \r\npersonally involved in the performance of the services pursuant to this agreement or a future \r\nagreement between the parties and who have a need to know such confidential information in \r\nconnection with the performance of such duties.",
            "<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 4>",
            "C. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason whatever, each party will immediately \r\nreturn to the other party all documents or other tangible records, and any and all copies \r\nthereof, within its possession, custody, or control, containing or reflecting any Confidential \r\nInformation.\r\nSECTION 5: TERM AND TERMINATION \r\nA. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and continue for one (1) \r\nyear. The Agreement will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms unless \r\nterminated by either party.\r\nB. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon fifteen (15) days prior written \r\nnotice.\r\nC. Neither party shall be liable or deemed to be in default for any delay or failure in \r\nperformance under this Agreement or interruption of service resulting, directly or indirectly, \r\nfrom acts of God, civil or military authority, acts of the public enemy, war, riots, civil \r\ndisturbances, insurrections, accidents, fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods, the elements, \r\nstrikes, labor disputes, shortages of suitable parts, materials, labor or transportation or any \r\ncauses beyond the control of such party.\r\nD. Company’s obligations of Compensation payment to Strategic Partner shall survive \r\ntermination of this Agreement for a period of six (6) months.\r\nSECTION 9: GENERAL TERMS \r\nA. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of \r\nMaryland applicable to contracts made and fully performed therein, and the state and federal \r\ncourts located in Maryland shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all suits and proceedings arising \r\nout of or in connection with this agreement. Both parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of \r\nsaid courts for purposes of any such suit or proceeding and waive any claim that any such \r\nforum is an inconvenient forum. \r\nB. Any notices to either party under this Agreement shall be effective when received, which \r\nshall be no greater than one (3) business days after being sent by a nationally recognized \r\nmessenger service, mail or email.\r\nC. This Agreement represents the entire Agreement between the parties. The Agreement may \r\nnot be amended, changed, or supplemented in any way except by written Agreement signed by \r\nboth parties.\r\nCompany: Lumina Solar Strategic Partner: Lightility\r\nBy By\r\nName Name\r\nTitle Title\r\nDate Date\r\nCommercial Business Development\r\nMark Manthy\r\n6/28/2022"
