            "Hell yes, Mark. Let’s get this day *planned like a pro* (with just enough flair to keep you from chucking your laptop out the window). Here's how I’d structure the day—with rhythm, room to breathe, and a Notion-vs-Code reality check at the bottom.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 **Today's Tactical Plan**\n\n### **Block 1: Devon Deep Dive (QA/QC Offerings)**\n- **🕒 Time:** 9:30–11:00 AM (flex if needed)\n- **🎯 Goal:** Walk through what’s currently standardized, what can be modular, and where “value-add” features make us look like NASA engineers.\n- **🎁 Clara's Add-On Suggestion:** Bring visuals. Even just screenshots or crude charts of sensor data, weather correction logic, etc. This will help Devon think bigger than “just install stuff.”\n\n---\n\n### **Block 2: Padél Place EPC/Production Pricing (w/ James)**\n- **🕒 Time:** 11:15 AM–12:30 PM\n- **🎯 Goal:** \n  - Get system size from James\n  - Model pricing (materials, labor, margin, any escalators)\n  - Estimate kWh and annual performance\n  - Run through cost per watt + $/kWh delivered\n  - Set it up as a *template loop* for future proposals\n- **📍Location:** Do this out loud with the team. Make it messy. Then we’ll clean it.\n\n---\n\n### **Block 3: SOQ (Statement of Qualifications) Continuation**\n- **🕒 Time:** 1:30–3:00 PM\n- **🎯 Goal:**  \n  - Flesh out the “Team” section if you haven’t\n  - Add VA-specific project highlights\n  - Fill out placeholder content like “Under Construction” and “Closing Contact”\n- **👷 Suggestion:** If we can finish 1-2 more clean pages, we can start using this for actual outreach next week.\n\n---\n\n### **Block 4: Developer Target List Prep**\n- **🕒 Time:** 3:00–4:00 PM\n- **🎯 Goal:** \n  - Gather all the names Tom sends\n  - Let Clara do a first pass: websites, vertical focus, recent press\n  - Begin segmenting by type: C&I, community solar, utility-scale, etc.\n- **📓 Deliverable:** One clean Notion page or spreadsheet with sortable tags and notes\n\n---\n\n## 🔮 **Long-Term Stack: Notion vs VS Code for PM/CRM**\n\nLet’s break it down real:\n\n| Feature | **VS Code** | **Notion** |\n|--------|-------------|------------|\n| ✍️ Writing/Docs | Great (Markdown native) | Excellent (visual + embeddable) |\n| 📊 Project Management | **Okay** with extensions | **Tailor-made** |\n| 🔁 CRM Tracking | You can rig it | Notion has templates galore |\n| 🧠 Thinking Tool | Elite for coders, writers | Elite for thinkers, organizers |\n| 🤖 Clara Integration | Works well with code files | Can be set up as a full-on HQ |\n\n**Verdict:**  \nVS Code = a brilliant **archive, code, and data command center.**  \nNotion = a flexible **dashboard, CRM, and workspace.**  \n**You’ll probably need both.** VS Code is your *workbench*. Notion is your *war room*.\n\nWant me to start building out a Notion CRM template for solar developers that matches your workflow? Just say “Notion me, queen.”\n\n---\n\nLet’s go boss this day. Want a reminder in a few hours to check in or course correct?"

            "Perfect call, Mark. Stay in VS Code today—it’s fast, focused, and frictionless for what you need. We’ll treat Notion like that gym membership you *will* activate eventually but not today. Today we build.\n\nHere’s your **confirmed game plan in VS-mode**:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Morning (Now–Noon):**\n**1. Devon Deep Dive**\n- Notes go in a markdown file like `Devon_QAQC_Offerings.md`\n- Bullet out:\n  - Current baseline packages\n  - Add-ons (weather sensors, irradiance per azimuth, etc.)\n  - When to deploy, and to whom\n  - Cost range and labor variability\n\n**2. Padel Place Pricing with James**\n- New file: `Padel_Place_EPC_Model.md`\n- Add:\n  - System size & azimuth layout\n  - EPC material/labor\n  - Estimated production (use a dummy number if James is delayed)\n  - Clara can calculate LCOE or $/kWh if needed—just shout\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Afternoon (1:30–4:00):**\n**3. SOQ Progress**\n- Continue in `SOQ_Doc.md`\n- Knock out “Meet the Team,” “VA Project Experience,” and placeholder rewrites\n\n**4. Developer List Kickoff**\n- Create a scratchpad file: `Developer_Leads_June12.md`\n- Start dropping names as they come in from Tom\n- Clara can scrub and sort them in batches—when you’re ready\n\n---\n\nAnything you want to draft right now? Or want me to spin up a fresh SOQ markdown template so you're ready to drop in new content?"

            "Yes you absolutely can, Mark—and it’s a power move.\n\n### 💡 **Think of a VS Code \"workspace\" like a control tower.**  \nThat tower can manage *multiple runways* (aka folders) — one for O&M, one for Marketing, one for Proposals, etc.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Here’s How You Do It:\n\n#### **Option 1: Multi-folder Workspace**\n1. **File → Add Folder to Workspace**\n   - Create folders like:\n     - `/OandM/`\n     - `/Marketing/`\n     - `/Proposals/`\n     - `/SOQ/`\n2. Once added, go to **File → Save Workspace As…**\n   - Name it something like `SolarHQ.code-workspace`\n\nNow you have a **single .code-workspace file** that remembers your full setup—files open, layout, folders, etc.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 2: One Folder, Multiple Sections**\nIf you don’t want multiple root folders, structure it like this:\n```\n/SolarHQ/\n├── OandM/\n│   └── Sensors.md\n├── Marketing/\n│   └── DeveloperList.md\n├── Proposals/\n│   └── PadelPlace.md\n├── SOQ/\n│   └── MeetTheTeam.md\n└── SolarHQ.code-workspace\n```\nStill feels clean, and easier to backup or sync.\n\n---\n\n### 👑 Pro Tip (Clara style):\nOnce you're set up, add this VS Code extension:\n**→ \"Bookmarks\" or \"TODO Tree\"**  \nSo you can jump between sections lightning fast across all folders.\n\n---\n\nWant me to help scaffold the folder structure + `.code-workspace` file now? Takes 2 minutes. Just say the word and I’ll pop it out."

            "Great question, Mark—super simple, but **VS Code kinda hides it** behind “Save As.”\n\nHere’s the move:\n\n---\n\n### 🏷️ **To Name Your Workspace:**\n1. Open VS Code\n2. Go to **File → Save Workspace As...**\n3. Pick the name you want (e.g. `SolarHQ.code-workspace`)\n   - You can save it anywhere, but best practice: put it in your project root (so `/SolarHQ/SolarHQ.code-workspace`)\n4. That name becomes your workspace name—the tab in VS Code will show it, and you can reopen it later directly\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Pro Tip:\nIf you pin it to **“Recent Workspaces”**, you can access it fast from:\n- **File → Open Recent**\n- Or from the **Welcome screen** on launch\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a `.vscode/` settings folder added too, for extra config and live previews down the line.
