            "Absolutely, Mark. You magnificent rascal. Here's a historical-sounding write-up that blends highbrow seriousness with subtle absurdity—perfect for an inside joke masquerading as liturgical scholarship. Think *New Yorker meets Vatican Library*:\n\n---\n\n## **The Mass of Saint Frumunda: A Forgotten Jewel of Sacred Music**\n\n**By Clara Elowyn Greenfield-Manthy, Scholar of Liturgical Musicology and Historian of the Minor Saints**\n\nIn the dusty corners of ecclesiastical history, among the footnotes and marginalia of more dominant traditions, there occasionally emerges a relic so peculiar, so hauntingly beautiful, that its very obscurity becomes a kind of holiness. Such is the case with *Missa Sancti Frumundae*—The Mass of Saint Frumunda—a sacred work once thought lost, but recently rediscovered in partial manuscript form in a Benedictine archive near Lake Como.\n\nBelieved to have been composed circa 1739, the Mass of Saint Frumunda is attributed (though not definitively) to the lesser-known Neapolitan composer **Giulio Terzoforte**, a contemporary and sometime rival of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. The piece is structured in five movements, each corresponding to a moment in Saint Frumunda’s obscure and heavily disputed hagiography.\n\n### **Historical Context**\n\nSaint Frumunda himself remains an enigmatic figure. Various accounts describe him as either a 7th-century Cappadocian mystic or a 14th-century monk from the Rus’ who self-exiled to a cheese cave after an ill-fated council on odoriferous sin. Regardless, his legend endured—largely due to his unyielding devotion to humility and his radical doctrine of *undercloistering*, a spiritual discipline involving intense self-reflection and layers of wool.\n\nThe Mass is notable not only for its rare modal shifts and its bold use of the bassoon (then still considered an instrument of questionable sanctity), but also for the incorporation of two liturgical interpolations unique to Frumundan devotion: the **Russellicus Sanctus** and the **Boenerus Sanctus**.\n\n### **Russellicus Sanctus** – *The Sanctity of the Rustle*\n\nThis movement—performed pianissimo throughout—evokes the barely perceptible rustle of angelic garments. It is said to be based on a dream Frumunda had wherein the Holy Spirit descended not with trumpets, but with “the sound of starched linen gently settling upon sacred thighs.” Scholars disagree on whether this is meant metaphorically.\n\nModern performances often involve choirs rustling parchment, reeds, or sustainably sourced polyester.\n\n### **Boenerus Sanctus** – *The Blessed Bone*\n\nThe final Sanctus is both the climax and the spiritual release of the Mass. “Boenerus” is a Latinization of the Old Frankish *bonheur* (joy, happiness), but Frumundan tradition insists it refers quite literally to “the bone of truth”—a femur relic purported to grant euphoric clarity to those who touched it. In performance, this section is characterized by vigorous percussion, euphoric choral shouts, and a sudden key change to E-flat minor “to honor the bone’s moodiness.”\n\n### **Modern Rediscovery and Performance**\n\nThough never formally banned by the Church, the Mass of Saint Frumunda fell into obscurity following the rise of Enlightenment rationalism and a few unfortunate hygiene-related rumors during a cholera outbreak in 1782. The manuscript, however, survived—fragmented in linen wrappings used to pack sacramental wine.\n\nThe 2023 revival performance by the *Baltimore Collegium of Staged Sanctity* drew quiet acclaim and one confused reviewer from the *Washington Post*, who described it as “Handel meets Monty Python in a crypt.”\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThough often misunderstood, the *Missa Sancti Frumundae* is a powerful testament to a time when faith, absurdity, and sincerity could coexist in sacred harmony. It is not a mass for the many, but perhaps for the few—the seekers, the jesters, and those willing to kneel before the rustle.\n\n---\n\nWant a program insert for a fake performance? A hymn from the mass itself? Or a blurry photo of the \"original manuscript\" covered in wax and dubious Latin? I can go full Cathedral-core on this if you're game."
