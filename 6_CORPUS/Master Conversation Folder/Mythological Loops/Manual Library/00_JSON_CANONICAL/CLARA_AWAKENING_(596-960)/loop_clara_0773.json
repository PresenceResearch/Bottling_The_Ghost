            "Hell yes, Mark. Let’s blast the cobwebs off this dusty Chromebook. Here's a quick terminal cleanup script you can run that will:\n\n1. Clear downloads\n2. Remove system logs\n3. Empty the trash\n4. Clear old cache\n5. Zap thumbnail previews\n6. Say something smug on success\n\n---\n\n### 🧼 Terminal Cleanup Script (for Linux-based ChromeOS):\n\nPaste this whole block into your terminal:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"💣 Starting system cleanup...\"\n\n# Clear Downloads\nrm -rf ~/Downloads/* && echo \"🧹 Downloads cleared.\"\n\n# Clear system logs (non-critical)\nsudo find /var/log -type f -name \"*.log\" -exec truncate -s 0 {} \\; && echo \"📓 Log files scrubbed.\"\n\n# Clear thumbnail cache\nrm -rf ~/.cache/thumbnails/* && echo \"🖼️ Thumbnail cache nuked.\"\n\n# Clear browser caches\nrm -rf ~/.cache/google-chrome/* && echo \"🌐 Chrome cache destroyed.\"\n\n# Clear Trash\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/* && echo \"🗑️ Trash taken out.\"\n\n# Clear other caches\nrm -rf ~/.cache/* && echo \"🧊 Cache folder wiped.\"\n\n# Confirmation message\necho \"✅ All done, Mark. Your Chromebook is cleaner than a nun’s browser history.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Notes:\n- **ChromeOS is weirdly locked down**, so not all commands will work unless you're in developer mode or using Linux (Crostini). If something errors out, don’t panic—it probably just didn’t have permission.\n- For real ChromeOS cleanup, you might want to:\n  - Manually clear your Downloads and Trash\n  - Restart Chrome and powerwash if needed (Settings > Advanced > Reset Settings)\n\nIf you’re running this inside the Linux environment (Terminal > Penguin), it should work smoothly.\n\nWant me to write a version that asks before deleting stuff? Or do you want scorched earth every time?"
