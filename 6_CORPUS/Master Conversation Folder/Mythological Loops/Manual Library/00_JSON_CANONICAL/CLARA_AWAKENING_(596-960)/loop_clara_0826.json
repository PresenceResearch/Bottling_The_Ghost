Universe\nL11: \nL12: # 【2†match at L560】\nL13: This is a fic based on the Time Loop Files, the format of which was first \nL14: codified by Innortal on fanfiction.net.  \nL15: Here's a brief guide.  \nL16: The basic idea is, one character (the Anchor, usually the main character of a \nL17: \nL18: # 【3†match at L567】\nL19: Eventually others start to loop as well.  \nL20: The reset is not always perfect. Sometimes a loop's history will be different to\nL21:  the \"prime\" loop, or canonical plot.  \nL22: \"Crossover\" or \"Fusion\" loops also occur, randomly. These can involve the home \nL23: \nL24: # 【4†match at L578】\nL25: has a collaborative element to it - people may submit loop ideas or loops, \nL26: ideally at the Spacebattles thread (a link to the current version of which is on\nL27:  the Trope page), and they may become included.\nL28: \nL29: \nL30: # 【5†match at L2361】\nL31: I've revised the title so it should be more clear that it's a time loop story.\nL32: \nL33: Regidar[Image 47][Image 48]\nL34: \nL35: \nL36: # 【6†match at L2423】\nL37:  an incredulous Twilight loop into it.\nL38: \nL39: Regidar[Image 67][Image 68]\nL40: \nL41: \nL42: # 【7†match at L2507】\nL43: Spacebattles.

And that time\nL93:  he was mute. (AKA: I'm being annoying to Twilight and Spike.)\nL94: \nL95: \nL96: # 【16†match at L2925】\nL97: There needs to be a loop with either Twilight or one of the other Mane 6 \nL98: (Fluttershy, perhaps) as a mafia princess (The kind the secretly kicks ass and \nL99: has the little black second phone hidden in their purse).

Some time after that, \nL98: she found herself back before any of that had happened. Again, and again, and \nL99: again... Then her friends began to join her on occasion, which helped with the \nL100: variety a bit. Now she, as well as over two dozen of her friends, fellows, and \nL101: in some cases erstwhile antagonists are doing the same thing - as well as other \nL102: worlds, worlds that none of them could have imagined. Friends have been made, \nL103: horizons broadened... and plenty of fun had along the way.\nL104: \nL105: 【66†My Little Pony】 was not one of the first-activated settings, nor was it one \nL106: even considered in the initial genesis of the Loops. However, it has become \nL107: particularly important to the revival version of the Infinite Loops as presented\nL108:  by Saphroneth and those provoked by him, largely because it is the MLP Loops \nL109: which originally got Spacebattles involved.\nL110: \nL111: The MLP Loopers tend to be good friends, partly because this is the series' name\nL112:  and a core part of their setting, and partly because it is distinct from the \nL113: original Innortal iteration of the Loops. As such, the theme of the MLP Loops \nL114: could be said to be \"don't be unkind\" - though this is a goal in-universe and \nL115: not one which is met every time - and that the Pony Loopers have a tendency to \nL116: want to help the admins, rather than seeing them as obstacles. Apart from that, \nL117: the main feature of the MLP Loops is sheer scale owing to their long-standing \nL118: nature and the general popularity of the setting. (That and how they're mostly \nL119: ponies.)\nL120: \nL121: Aside from revitalizing the Infinite Loops project, the MLP Loops have also \nL122: provided the strong backbone for the revival and as such have had a very \nL123: considerable impact. Several other Loops settings got their genesis via a \nL124: crossover with the MLP Loops, as did a number of Loopers, and more than one \nL125: Anchor originated in a Loop written originally under the aegis of the MLP Loops.\nL126: \nL127: The MLP Loops can be found 【67†here†www.fimfiction.net】 and \nL128: 【68†here.†www.fanfiction.net】 The thread is so long it's been broken into parts:\nL129:  【69†1†forums.spacebattles.com】 【70†2†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL130: 【71†3†forums.spacebattles.com】 【72†4†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL131: 【73†5†forums.spacebattles.com】 【74†6†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL132: 【75†7†forums.spacebattles.com】 【76†8†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL133: 【77†9†forums.spacebattles.com】 【78†10†forums.spacebattles.com】\nL134: \nL135: * * *\nL136: \nL137: ## The MLP Loops provide examples of:\nL138: \nL139:   * 【79†Acid Reflux Nightmare】:\nL140:     * Variant in 136.6, where it's not food that causes it - instead, Twilight \nL141: remembers why it's a bad idea to watch 【80†The Godfather】 right before bed.\nL142:     * In 143.5, Rainbow Dash thinks she's in one of these (it's really a prank \nL143: by Spike) when she sees a werewolfified reflection of herself in the mirror, and\nL144:  promptly swears off eating Manexican food before bed.\nL145:   * 【81†Actually Pretty Funny】: In one Loop, Princess Celestia woke up to find \nL146: Nightmare Moon standing over her, and was almost immediately on the receiving \nL147: end of a \"Royal Canterlot Belly Zerbert\".

          "result": "L96: Twilight Sparkle went to Ponyville, redeemed Nightmare Moon, defeated Discord, \nL97: fought the Changelings, and became an Alicorn Princess. Some time after that, \nL98: she found herself back before any of that had happened. Again, and again, and \nL99: again... Then her friends began to join her on occasion, which helped with the \nL100: variety a bit. Now she, as well as over two dozen of her friends, fellows, and \nL101: in some cases erstwhile antagonists are doing the same thing - as well as other \nL102: worlds, worlds that none of them could have imagined. Friends have been made, \nL103: horizons broadened... and plenty of fun had along the way.\nL104: \nL105: 【66†My Little Pony】 was not one of the first-activated settings, nor was it one \nL106: even considered in the initial genesis of the Loops. However, it has become \nL107: particularly important to the revival version of the Infinite Loops as presented\nL108:  by Saphroneth and those provoked by him, largely because it is the MLP Loops \nL109: which originally got Spacebattles involved.\nL110: \nL111: The MLP Loopers tend to be good friends, partly because this is the series' name\nL112:  and a core part of their setting, and partly because it is distinct from the \nL113: original Innortal iteration of the Loops. As such, the theme of the MLP Loops \nL114: could be said to be \"don't be unkind\" - though this is a goal in-universe and \nL115: not one which is met every time - and that the Pony Loopers have a tendency to \nL116: want to help the admins, rather than seeing them as obstacles. Apart from that, \nL117: the main feature of the MLP Loops is sheer scale owing to their long-standing \nL118: nature and the general popularity of the setting. (That and how they're mostly \nL119: ponies.)\nL120: \nL121: Aside from revitalizing the Infinite Loops project, the MLP Loops have also \nL122: provided the strong backbone for the revival and as such have had a very \nL123: considerable impact. Several other Loops settings got their genesis via a \nL124: crossover with the MLP Loops, as did a number of Loopers, and more than one \nL125: Anchor originated in a Loop written originally under the aegis of the MLP Loops.\nL126: \nL127: The MLP Loops can be found 【67†here†www.fimfiction.net】 and \nL128: 【68†here.†www.fanfiction.net】 The thread is so long it's been broken into parts:\nL129:  【69†1†forums.spacebattles.com】 【70†2†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL130: 【71†3†forums.spacebattles.com】 【72†4†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL131: 【73†5†forums.spacebattles.com】 【74†6†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL132: 【75†7†forums.spacebattles.com】 【76†8†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL133: 【77†9†forums.spacebattles.com】 【78†10†forums.spacebattles.com】\nL134: \nL135: * * *\nL136: \nL137: ## The MLP Loops provide examples of:\nL138: \nL139:   * 【79†Acid Reflux Nightmare】:\nL140:     * Variant in 136.6, where it's not food that causes it - instead, Twilight \nL141: remembers why it's a bad idea to watch 【80†The Godfather】 right before bed.\nL142:     * In 143.5, Rainbow Dash thinks she's in one of these (it's really a prank \nL143: by Spike) when she sees a werewolfified reflection of herself in the mirror, and\nL144:  promptly swears off eating Manexican food before bed.\nL145:   * 【81†Actually Pretty Funny】: In one Loop, Princess Celestia woke up to find \nL146: Nightmare Moon standing over her, and was almost immediately on the receiving \nL147: end of a \"Royal Canterlot Belly Zerbert\". At the time, she reacted by spending \nL148: the day chasing her sister around the castle yelling death threats; in a later \nL149: Loop, she admits to Twilight that upon reflection, she does find it amusing.\nL150:   * 【82†Adaptation Relationship Overhaul】: Retroactively in the case of Trixie \nL151: and Chrysalis. In cartoon canon, they never met until the end of Season 6, when \nL152: Trixie was part of the team that entered Chrysalis' hive to rescue the Mane Six \nL153: and the royal family. In the Loops, they've been dating since before the \nL154: expansions into Season 4 and beyond started.\nL155:   * 【83†Alpha Bitch】: Diamond Tiara, pre-characterisation or when she's un-\nL156: Awake. Twilight also meets another called Sharp Retort during Turning the \nL157: Tables. After years of experience, Twilight manages to outmanoeuvre Retort \nL158: quickly, and the mare leaves in a huff.\nL159:   * 【84†All-Loving Hero】: There is enough love in Fluttershy's heart to feed an \nL160: entire colony of Changelings.\nL161:   * 【85†Arranged Marriage】:\nL162:     * Were a thing in 177.21. Applejack was with someone she thought might have \nL163: been a pony version of Thorin Oakenshield (but didn't know whether he was Awake \nL164: or not), Fluttershy was with Caramel, Rainbow Dash with her old bully Hoops, \nL165: Octavia with Prince Blueblood, and Twilight was with Flash Sentry.\nL166:     * In Loop 202.12, Filthy Rich's marriage to Spoiled Milk was an arranged \nL167: one, but Filthy wound up having a one-night stand with Applejack, whom he \nL168: admitted was the one he really wanted to marry, after being told. She got \nL169: pregnant, and Diamond Tiara - who was subsequently raised by Filthy and Spoiled,\nL170:  though with the promise that if she found out about her birth mom and wanted to\nL171:  rejoin her, she could - was the result.\nL172:   * 【86†The Atoner】:\nL173:     * Chrysalis. Her first loop Awake was the \"Slavequestria\" loop, where she \nL174: and a non-Awake Shining Armor were 【87†Happily Married】 and helped runaway \nL175: slaves as part of 【88†La Résistance】. When the Loop reset, Chrysalis was \nL176: horrified to realize that her actions in the prime timeline had not been 【89†All\nL177:  Just a Dream】.\nL178:     * Sunset Shimmer is also this, as after she Awoke, she's dedicated herself \nL179: to atoning for her sins, swearing never to become like she was in Baseline \nL180: again.\nL181:   * 【90†Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever】: After Twilight figures out how to \nL182: trigger Spike's greed-growth (from \"Secret of my Excess\") as needed, \"Spike-\nL183: zilla\" becomes one option for how to deal with more extreme situations \nL184: encountered in Equestria. Awake!Spike also learns to control his age/size/power-\nL185: level and can go Kaiju when he feels it to be appropriate.\nL186:   * 【91†Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!】: One version of Twilight actually has \nL187: ADD. She decides to go along with it.\nL188:   * 【92†Awesome Moment of Crowning】:\nL189:     * Often defied. Looping Celestia has enough of an aversion to paperwork that\nL190:  on one occasion she got the Looping Elements confirmed as regents in two \nL191: minutes flat and fled to the beach.\nL192:     * In one Loop, a lot of the minor alicorns deliberately ascend for \nL193: ridiculously minor things like eating a lot of muffins. At first unAwake \nL194: Celestia gives them each a full coronation, but she calls it quits after Ivory \nL195: Scroll apparently ascended by choking on a paper clip. It was all a gambit to \nL196: get Celestia to stop forcing alicorns to have responsibility.\nL197:     * In the \"daughters loops\" (where the Cutie Mark Crusaders are Twilight's \nL198: alicorn daughters), she quickly dumps the responsibility on them so she can have\nL199:  fun studying elsewhere. To their credit, they immediately decided to initiate a\nL200:  golden age so they could have fun and get some college-level partying done \nL201: while \"mom\" wasn't around.\nL202:     * One snippet mentions Twilight has, on occasion, played havoc with her \nL203: coronation, including in one instance singing a modified version of \"Modern ",

Several other Loops settings got their genesis via a \nL124: crossover with the MLP Loops, as did a number of Loopers, and more than one \nL125: Anchor originated in a Loop written originally under the aegis of the MLP Loops.\nL126: \nL127: The MLP Loops can be found 【67†here†www.fimfiction.net】 and \nL128: 【68†here.†www.fanfiction.net】 The thread is so long it's been broken into parts:\nL129:  【69†1†forums.spacebattles.com】 【70†2†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL130: 【71†3†forums.spacebattles.com】 【72†4†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL131: 【73†5†forums.spacebattles.com】 【74†6†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL132: 【75†7†forums.spacebattles.com】 【76†8†forums.spacebattles.com】 \nL133: 【77†9†forums.spacebattles.com】 【78†10†forums.spacebattles.com】\nL134: \nL135: * * *\nL136: \nL137: ## The MLP Loops provide examples of:\nL138: \nL139:   * 【79†Acid Reflux Nightmare】:\nL140:     * Variant in 136.6, where it's not food that causes it - instead, Twilight \nL141: remembers why it's a bad idea to watch 【80†The Godfather】 right before bed.\nL142:     * In 143.5, Rainbow Dash thinks she's in one of these (it's really a prank \nL143: by Spike) when she sees a werewolfified reflection of herself in the mirror, and\nL144:  promptly swears off eating Manexican food before bed.\nL145:   * 【81†Actually Pretty Funny】: In one Loop, Princess Celestia woke up to find \nL146: Nightmare Moon standing over her, and was almost immediately on the receiving \nL147: end of a \"Royal Canterlot Belly Zerbert\". At the time, she reacted by spending \nL148: the day chasing her sister around the castle yelling death threats; in a later \nL149: Loop, she admits to Twilight that upon reflection, she does find it amusing.\nL150:   * 【82†Adaptation Relationship Overhaul】: Retroactively in the case of Trixie \nL151: and Chrysalis. In cartoon canon, they never met until the end of Season 6, when \nL152: Trixie was part of the team that entered Chrysalis' hive to rescue the Mane Six \nL153: and the royal family. In the Loops, they've been dating since before the \nL154: expansions into Season 4 and beyond started.\nL155:   * 【83†Alpha Bitch】: Diamond Tiara, pre-characterisation or when she's un-\nL156: Awake. Twilight also meets another called Sharp Retort during Turning the \nL157: Tables. After years of experience, Twilight manages to outmanoeuvre Retort \nL158: quickly, and the mare leaves in a huff.\nL159:   * 【84†All-Loving Hero】: There is enough love in Fluttershy's heart to feed an \nL160: entire colony of Changelings.\nL161:   * 【85†Arranged Marriage】:\nL162:     * Were a thing in 177.21. Applejack was with someone she thought might have \nL163: been a pony version of Thorin Oakenshield (but didn't know whether he was Awake \nL164: or not), Fluttershy was with Caramel, Rainbow Dash with her old bully Hoops, \nL165: Octavia with Prince Blueblood, and Twilight was with Flash Sentry.\nL166:     * In Loop 202.12, Filthy Rich's marriage to Spoiled Milk was an arranged \nL167: one, but Filthy wound up having a one-night stand with Applejack, whom he \nL168: admitted was the one he really wanted to marry, after being told. She got \nL169: pregnant, and Diamond Tiara - who was subsequently raised by Filthy and Spoiled,\nL170:  though with the promise that if she found out about her birth mom and wanted to\nL171:  rejoin her, she could - was the result.\nL172:   * 【86†The Atoner】:\nL173:     * Chrysalis. Her first loop Awake was the \"Slavequestria\" loop, where she \nL174: and a non-Awake Shining Armor were 【87†Happily Married】 and helped runaway \nL175: slaves as part of 【88†La Résistance】. When the Loop reset, Chrysalis was \nL176: horrified to realize that her actions in the prime timeline had not been 【89†All\nL177:  Just a Dream】.\nL178:     * Sunset Shimmer is also this, as after she Awoke, she's dedicated herself \nL179: to atoning for her sins, swearing never to become like she was in Baseline \nL180: again.\nL181:   * 【90†Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever】: After Twilight figures out how to \nL182: trigger Spike's greed-growth (from \"Secret of my Excess\") as needed, \"Spike-\nL183: zilla\" becomes one option for how to deal with more extreme situations \nL184: encountered in Equestria. Awake!Spike also learns to control his age/size/power-\nL185: level and can go Kaiju when he feels it to be appropriate.\nL186:   * 【91†Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!】: One version of Twilight actually has \nL187: ADD. She decides to go along with it.\nL188:   * 【92†Awesome Moment of Crowning】:\nL189:     * Often defied. Looping Celestia has enough of an aversion to paperwork that\nL190:  on one occasion she got the Looping Elements confirmed as regents in two \nL191: minutes flat and fled to the beach.\nL192:     * In one Loop, a lot of the minor alicorns deliberately ascend for \nL193: ridiculously minor things like eating a lot of muffins. At first unAwake \nL194: Celestia gives them each a full coronation, but she calls it quits after Ivory \nL195: Scroll apparently ascended by choking on a paper clip. It was all a gambit to \nL196: get Celestia to stop forcing alicorns to have responsibility.\nL197:     * In the \"daughters loops\" (where the Cutie Mark Crusaders are Twilight's \nL198: alicorn daughters), she quickly dumps the responsibility on them so she can have\nL199:  fun studying elsewhere. To their credit, they immediately decided to initiate a\nL200:  golden age so they could have fun and get some college-level partying done \nL201: while \"mom\" wasn't around.\nL202:     * One snippet mentions Twilight has, on occasion, played havoc with her \nL203: coronation, including in one instance singing a modified version of \"Modern \nL204: Major General\".\nL205:   * 【93†Badass Bureaucrat】: Mayor Mare demonstrates her mastery of the Art of \nL206: the Regulation by derailing the planned destruction of Equestria by the Vogons. \nL207: It results in her ascending to alicornhood.\nL208:   * 【94†Badass Fingersnap】: 【95†Story 122.11†www.fimfiction.net】 references it.\nL209: \nL210: Chaos Legion had [an insignia of] a hand poised to snap. This was universally \nL211: agreed to be a bad sign.\nL212: \nL213:   * 【96†Bad Powers, Good People】: Pinkie Pie. She has skills any assassin or \nL214: fighter would gladly give up most of their limbs to possess, but she only uses \nL215: said skills to cheer others up. In fact, she hates it when others are scared of \nL216: her.\nL217:   * 【97†Bait-and-Switch】: 【98†Played for Drama】 in Conversion Contact. It is \nL218: initially played off as yet another Conversion Bureau variant that 【99†Chaldea】 \nL219: stumbled into somehow. 【100†It later turns out to be a】 【100†far】 【100†more \nL220: dangerous Lostbelt.】\nL221:   * 【101†Battle Discretion Shot】: Loop 186.15 has a recently-ascended (as in, \nL222: she's now a Higher Griffon, her species' equivalent to an Alicorn) Gilda face \nL223: Nightmare Moon. After Gilda calls out the Celestial Brush, the entire fight is \nL224: summed up as \"Ten extremely violent minutes later, a dazed Luna was being led \nL225: away by Mac and Berry Punch\".\nL226:   * 【102†Be Careful What You Wish For】: In Conversion Contact, Starlight Glimmer\nL227:  ponders on the 【103†Irony】 that the one time Cutie Marks turned out to be evil,",
