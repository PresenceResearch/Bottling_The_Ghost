          "text": "\nIn a nutshell, compared to PJM’s 【86†day-ahead and real-time†www.pcienergysolutions.com】 energy markets, the RPM ensures long-term grid reliability by securing future capacity—the appropriate power of power supply resources necessary to satisfy predicted energy demand typically three years into the future. The BRA essentially allows PJM to procure resource commitments to satisfy the region’s unforced capacity obligation for a capacity delivery year (this auction’s period spans June 1, 2025, to May 31, 2026).\n\nAs a whole, in each BRA, PJM aims to procure a target capacity reserve level for the RTO in a “least-cost” manner while also taking into account reliability-based constraints on the location and type of capacity that can be committed. PJM allocates the cost of those commitments to load-serving entities (like NRG Energy or Vistra) through a locational reliability charge, which is then paid to power supply resources for performance. The total cost for the 2025/2026 BRA was $14.7 billion, PJM said on Tuesday. \n\nBRA auctions are usually held three years in advance of the delivery year. While the 2025/2026 auction was originally scheduled to be held in May 2022, it was suspended while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considered the approval of new capacity market rules. The recent July 2024 auction stems from a compressed schedule that aims to return to the three-year forward basis. According to PJM, the next BRA—for the 2026/2027 delivery year—is scheduled for December 2024.\n\nBut compared to previous auctions, the 2025/2026 auction results point to several concerning trends. “The significantly higher prices in this auction confirm our concerns that the supply/demand balance is tightening across the RTO,” noted PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana. “The market is sending a price signal that should incent investment in resources.”\n\n[Image 2: INSERT ART.

Peak load forecast for the 2025/2026 delivery year surged upwards to 153,883 MW, compared to  150,640 MW for the 2024/2025 BRA, it noted. \n\nIn addition, the entity pointed to impacts from recent market reforms approved by the FERC. These include “improved reliability risk modeling for extreme weather and accreditation that more accurately values each resource’s contribution to reliability,” it said.\n\n[Image 4: INSERT ART.

Courtesy: 【88†PJM†pjm.com】\n\n## A Key Worry: Fourth Year in a Row Where Supply Resources Fell \n\nA more concerning factor for the RTO is that this year the amount of supply resources in the auction fell yet again this year. As the 【88†RTO’s report shows†pjm.com】, supply offered into the RPM capacity market declined by more than 13 GW, falling to 135,692.3 MW in the 2025/2026 BRA. That compares to 148,945.7 MW of supply offered in the 2024/2025 BRA. \n\n“This is the fourth BRA in a row where the total capacity offered from non-[energy efficiency (EE)] resources has declined,” the report notes. In addition, the number of constrained Locational Deliverability Areas (LDAs) dropped from five to two in the 2025/2026 BRA. “The total amount of capacity, excluding EE Resources, in RPM that cleared decreased by 5,743.6 MW from 140,415.8 MW in the 2024/2025 BRA to 134,672.2 MW in the 2025/2026 BRA,” it said. \n\nThe auction results add new weight to PJM’s long-voiced concerns ab",

A higher reliability requirement in RPM vs FRR and demand growth led to a shortage.  \n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe capacity price outcome signals a capacity need…but it does not guarantee new capacity.\n\n[Image 3: PJM Capacity price chart - Charles River Associates]\n\n  * If capacity prices are above Net CONE*, on average, an investor would expect to be made whole for the year without other non-energy revenues.\n  * In BGE and DOM, the price exceeded Gross CONE – on average, a new plant could be “in the money” for the year even without energy revenues.\n\n  * Signal duration – PJM capacity prices are for a single delivery year. New power plants must earn returns over a much longer period, so investment will depend on longer-term views and arrangements.\n  * Lack of headroom – Only 22 MW of annual resources failed to clear – capacity is not standing on the sideline waiting to enter.[Image 4: PJM capacity - CRA]\n  * Interconnection challenges – Even if investors are convinced, new entry is delayed by the significant queue. The PJM queue is dominated by resources with low accredited capacity value.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\n  * Planned reforms – The auction result will be a major consideration in PJM’s already planned deliberations on further market reforms.\n  * Additional changes – The high prices will likely drive stakeholders to advocate market changes and possibly out-of-market interventions.\n  * Disputes – When prices and costs dramatically swing, there are often challenges to contracts and finances.\n  * Auctions – PJM is off-schedule and trying to get back to 3-year forward auctions. There will be two more auctions within the next year (see schedule). This leaves minimal time for new capacity to impact outcomes or for load to respond (it continues to grow, mostly due to data centers, other large loads, and electrification).\n\nDelivery Year Auction Date  \n2026/27 Dec 2024  \n2027/28 Jun 2025  \n2028/29 Dec 2025  \n2029/30 May 2026  \n\nCRA energy consultants provide expertise to utilities, regulators, investors, and developers evaluating strategies and opportunities in PJM and other regions.

          "text": "customers must be approved by the government. In Maryland, rates are reviewed \r\nand approved by the Public Service Commission (PSC). While in other industries \r\ncompetition incentivizes companies to keep prices low, utilities are regulated \r\nbecause they do not have to compete against other companies in their service areas. \r\nAs regulated entities, utilities enjoy lower market risks than other industries.\r\nIn an MRP, rates are based \r\non projected spending, \r\nwith little accountability. \r\nAn MRP also allows utilities \r\nto charge customers \r\nfor the costs of projects \r\nbefore those projects are \r\nused to serve customers.\r\n1What Rate Increase Is BGE Proposing?\r\nBGE’s MRP application requests to increase the rate charged for the distribution\r\nof energy—the rate charged for delivering gas and electricity to your home. \r\nMost of the commodity cost (the cost of the energy itself) is passed directly \r\nthrough to customers. The utility does not control other costs, such as taxes, \r\nthat are included in a customer’s bill. Separating out the distribution rate \r\nincreases from the rest of the utility bill provides a clear picture of the rate \r\nincreases BGE is proposing. The charts below provide BGE distribution rates \r\nfrom past years for context, the current rates, and the rates requested by BGE.\r\nBGE’s proposed distribution rates for gas would increase rates by more than \r\nthree times what BGE charged in 2010, while electric rates would more than \r\ndouble. The last year that rates were in place as a result of a standard rate case \r\n(instead of an MRP) was 2020. \r\nWhy Is BGE Proposing Changes to Rates?\r\nDistribution rate increases are primarily driven by spending on infrastructure. \r\nUtility infrastructure is necessary to maintain safe and reliable service. \r\nDistribution rates generally will stay constant if the utility is replacing and \r\nbuilding new infrastructure at the same \r\nrate as older infrastructure is paid off or \r\nretired. But if infrastructure is replaced \r\nor added more quickly, distribution \r\nrates will increase. Utility investors profit \r\nprimarily from spending on infrastructure, \r\nwith more spending bringing greater \r\nreturns. Thus, effective regulation is \r\nnecessary to ensure utilities spend at \r\nappropriate levels.\r\nYear Rate ($/therm)\r\nACTUAL\r\n2010 $0.30\r\n2020 $0.60 % Increase \r\nfrom \r\n2023 $0.67 2023\r\nPROPOSED\r\n 2024* $0.96 43%\r\n2025 $1.01 51%\r\n2026 $1.08 61%\r\nBGE Actual and Proposed \r\nGas Distribution Rates\r\nBGE Actual and Proposed \r\nElectric Distribution Rates\r\nYear Rate ($/kWh)\r\nACTUAL\r\n2010 $0.025\r\n2020 $0.037 % Increase \r\nfrom \r\n2023 $0.042 2023\r\nPROPOSED\r\n 2024* $0.051 21%\r\n2025 $0.049 17%\r\n2026 $0.055 31%\r\nIf infrastructure is replaced \r\nor added more quickly, \r\ndistribution rates will \r\nincrease. Currently, BGE is \r\nspending at a rate of more \r\nthan $1.2 million per day on \r\ncapital gas infrastructure.\r\n*Rates in 2024 include a “reconciliation adjustment,” an aspect of the MRP that allows BGE to \r\ncharge ratepayers for spending in 2021 and 2022 that exceeded the originally approved rates. \r\n2025 and 2026 do not include reconciliation adjustments that may be imposed in the future. \r\n2Currently, BGE is spending at a rate of more than $1.2 million per day on capital \r\ngas infrastructure, and this spending goes beyond promoting the reliability and \r\nsafety of the system for existing customers. In 2022, BGE spent $78 million to \r\nconnect new customers and expand its gas distribution systems. These costs \r\nare included in the rates paid by all ratepayers. For electricity, BGE’s distribution \r\nplant additions would almost triple BGE’s spending from 2017 to 2026.\r\nWhat Would This Mean for My Energy Bill? \r\nAssuming that gas usage in the winter averages 160 therms per month, under \r\nBGE’s proposed MRP, a customer’s monthly winter bill for distribution (excluding \r\ncommodity costs) would grow from $111 in 2020 to $189 in 2026, an increase \r\nof 70%. For electric usage of 1,000 kWh/month, a customer’s distribution bill \r\nwould grow from $45 in 2020 to $65 in 2026, an increase of 44%. \r\n*Note: A customer may use more or less than 160 therms/month. \r\nBGE Electric Distribution Plant Additions ($ millions) \r\nMonthly Winter Bill for Gas Customer Using 160 therms/month, 2010 to 2026\r\nFORECASTED\r\nBGE Gas Winter Monthly Bill\r\nProjected BGE Gas \r\nWinter Monthly Bill\r\nAverage Growth Rate\r\n$60\r\n$111\r\n$124\r\n$170\r\n$177\r\n$189\r\n52% \r\nincrease\r\nA customer’s winter gas and electric distribution charges would \r\ngrow from $156 in 2020 to $254 in 2026, a total increase of 63%.\r\n3The average rate of growth in distribution charges between 2010 and 2023 was \r\n3.5% for electricity and 5.7% for gas. BGE’s rate increases proposed in its \r\nMRP outpace these historic growth rates, and are significantly higher than \r\ninflation, which averaged 2.5% from 2010 to 2022. \r\nIn contrast to the summary above, BGE’s application to the PSC presents a \r\ndifferent picture of its proposed rate increases by using a “total bill” cost. \r\nBGE says that if approved, the MRP will result in an overall price increase of \r\nonly 1.7% in total",

This substantial increase in capacity price can be attributed to three primary changes PJM \r\nmade prior to the capacity auction: (1) an increase in forecasted Peak Load, (2) an increase in the target Installed Reserve \r\nMargin, and (3) a decrease in Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) factors assigned to the various electric generating \r\nor load-reducing resources. \r\nPJM’s Increase in Forecast Peak Load and Target Installed Reserve Margin\r\nPrior to the 2025/26 BRA, PJM released the Planning Period Parameters that would need to be met by the upcoming \r\nauction. The updated Planning Period Parameters included an increase in forecast peak load from 150,640 MW during the \r\n2024/25 delivery year to 153,883 MW during the 2025/26 delivery year, an increase of over 3,200 MW or 2.2%. FIGURE 2\r\nshows the forecast peak load for the last 10 PJM capacity auctions. \r\n1 PJM’s capacity market years operate from June 1 to May 31 of the following year2025/26 PJM BRA RESULTS & IMPACTS AUGUST 2024\r\n© 2024 ENERGY VENTURES ANALYSIS 6\r\nFIGURE 2: PJM FORECAST PEAK LOAD FOR THE LAST 10 CAPACITY AUCTIONS\r\nAfter years of declining forecast peak load, PJM’s demand forecast has shown a noticeable reversal as the 2025/26 forecast \r\npeak load represents a 2.2% increase over the 2024/25 peak load forecast. According to PJM’s January 2024 load forecast \r\nreport2, the primary drivers in PJM’s increased electricity demand forecast were positive shifts in electrification of the \r\ntransportation sector (i.e., electric vehicles) and a substantial growth in electricity demand from data centers. Specifically, \r\nPJM staff adjusted the demand forecast for anticipated point loads due to data center growth in its American Electric \r\nPower (AEP), Allegheny Power (APS), DOM, and PSEG (PS) zones. FIGURE 3 shows PJM’s updated 2024 load forecast for \r\nthe entire RTO with a comparison to its 2023 load forecast, highlighting the massive electricity demand growth the ISO is \r\nnow projecting over the next decade. \r\nFIGURE 3: PJM'S 2024 RTO ELECTRIC PEAK LOAD FORECAST\r\nBesides the apparent substantial upward shift in forecasts for both summer and winter peaks across the PJM RTO, it is \r\nalso worth noting the noticeable increase in weather-adjusted winter peak demand over the last decade, as more states \r\nwithin the PJM footprint pursue more aggressive GHG emission reduction goals and encourage increased switching from \r\nfossil fuels (e.g., natural gas and oil) to electricity within the residential and commercial heating sectors.

Following the system strains \r\nduring Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022, PJM proposed to increase its IRM target by 3.1 percentage points to 17.8%. \r\nAdditionally, PJM changed the methodology for calculating the FPR for the 2025/26 BRA due to changes in the ELCC of its \r\nparticipating resources, as explained later. During the 2024/25 BRA, the FPR was calculated as follows:\r\nForecast Pool Requirement (FPR) = (1+IRM) *(1- Pool-Wide 5-Year Average Equivalent Forced Outage Rates (EFORd))\r\n2024/25 BRA FPR = (1+14.7%) * (1-5.02%) = 1.0894\r\nHowever, for the 2025/26 BRA, PJM changed the formula to the following:\r\n2025/26 FPR = (1+IRM) * Pool-Wide Accredited Unforced Capacity (UCAP) Factor\r\n2025/26 FPR = (1+17.8%)*79.69% = 0.9387\r\nAs a result, the PJM RTO Reliability Requirement (inclusive of all possible FRR resources) for the 2025/26",

            "The most recent PJM capacity auction, which impacts Baltimore Gas & Electric (BGE) customers, has shown a significant rise in future electricity prices due to a tightening supply-demand balance and changes in market regulations. For the 2025/26 delivery year, capacity prices for BGE surged to $466.35/MW-day, which is about 9-10 times higher than previous years. This jump is primarily driven by several factors:\n\n1. **Supply Constraints**: A major reduction in available power supply due to retirements of key plants like Brandon Shores and Wagner, which significantly reduced in-zone capacity for BGE.\n   \n2. **Increased Demand**: Forecasted peak electricity demand has grown by over 3,200 MW, partly due to factors like data center expansion and electrification efforts across PJM’s service area.\n\n3. **Regulatory Adjustments**: Changes in how capacity is accredited and stricter reliability requirements also contributed to the higher prices.\n\nAs a result, BGE customers should expect noticeable increases in their electricity bills from 2025 onward, as the costs of capacity will be passed down to consumers. This upward pressure on prices will likely lead to double-digit percentage increases for residential customers unless significant new generation capacity or policy changes come into play【7†source】【8†source】【10†source】."

The auction secured resources to meet PJM's reliability requirements, but the prices were notably higher due to several factors, driving up capacity costs for end users.\n\n[Image 4]\n\nKey Factors Driving Higher Prices\n\n  1. Decreased Supply: A substantial number of generator retirements reduced the electricity supply entering the auction.\n  2. Increased Demand: The forecasted peak load for the 2025/2026 Delivery Year increased from 150,640 MW to 153,883 MW.\n  3. Market Reforms: FERC-approved market reforms, including improved reliability risk modeling for extreme weather, have tightened the supply-demand balance.\n\nAuction Results\n\nThe auction cleared at $269.92/MW-day for much of the PJM footprint, a stark increase from $28.92/MW-day in the previous year's auction. This hike reflects the market's need to incentivize new investment in generation resources.\n\nImpact on End Users\n\nHigher capacity prices translate to increased electricity costs for end users across PJM's 13 states and the District of Columbia. End users should anticipate rising fixed all-in energy costs as suppliers pass on these increased capacity costs.\n\nConstrained Areas\n\nPrices hit the zonal cap in the BGE zone in Maryland ($466.35/MW-day) and the Dominion zone in Virginia and North Carolina ($444.26/MW-day) due to insufficient local resources and transmission constraints. These areas will benefit from additional generation resources or improved transmission infrastructure to import capacity.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nPJM's capacity auction highlights a tightening supply-demand balance and underscores the need for new investments in generation resources. End users can expect continued upward pressure on electricity costs as PJM implements further market reforms and seeks to address resource adequacy concerns.\n\nFor additional information please 【12†contact us】 to schedule a quick call.\n\nInsights\n\n## Related Articles\n\n【15†News】, 【10†Sustainability】, 【16†Pennsylvania】 \n\n#### 【17†City of Philadelphia Releases 2019 Energy Benchmarking Report】\n\n【17† 】 \n\nThe city of Philadelphia has released their 2019 report on the energy benchmarking that has been...\n\n【17† Read More 】 \n\n【18†Reporting】, 【19†Energy Efficiency】, 【10†Sustainability】, 【20†Massachusetts】, 【21†Renewable Energy】 \n\n#### 【22†BERDO 2.0: Navigating Boston's Enhanced Building Emissions Ordinance】\n\n【22† 】 \n\nIn 2013, the initial implementation of the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance...\n\n【22† Read More 】 \n\n【10†Sustainability】, 【11†Markets】, 【21†Renewable Energy】, 【23†Cost Components】 \n\n#### 【24†Understanding Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and Their Impact on Electricity Costs】\n\n【24† 】 \n\nRenewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) are regulatory mandates requiring electric utilities and...\n\n【24† Read More 】 \n\n[Image 5: logo_full-color]\n\nYour Strategic  \nPower Partner \n\n【25† †www.linkedin.com】 \n\n    * 【0† Services 】 \n      * 【1† Energy Procurement 】 \n      * 【2† Sustainability 】 \n      * 【3† Risk Management 】 \n      * 【4† Demand Response 】 \n      * 【5† Reporting 】 \n      * 【6† Energy Efficiency 】 \n    * 【8† Resources 】 \n    * 【7† About 】 \n\n【12† Contact Us 】 \n\n【25† †www.linkedin.com】 \n\n【26†877-214-9066†tel:+8772149066】\n\ninfo@stanwichenergy.com\n\n2 Greenwich Office Park   \nGreenwich, CT 06831\n\n###\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

          "text": "triggers substantial financial penalties, as experienced by numerous generators in the fallout of December 2022 Winter \r\nStorm Elliott. \r\nChanges to PJM’s Capacity Market Prior to the 2025/26 Base \r\nResidual Auction\r\nAs previously mentioned, PJM’s 2025/26 BRA cleared at a capacity price of $269.92/MW-d, representing a 10-fold increase \r\nin price over the previous BRA. This substantial increase in capacity price can be attributed to three primary changes PJM \r\nmade prior to the capacity auction: (1) an increase in forecasted Peak Load, (2) an increase in the target Installed Reserve \r\nMargin, and (3) a decrease in Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) factors assigned to the various electric generating \r\nor load-reducing resources. \r\nPJM’s Increase in Forecast Peak Load and Target Installed Reserve Margin\r\nPrior to the 2025/26 BRA, PJM released the Planning Period Parameters that would need to be met by the upcoming \r\nauction. The updated Planning Period Parameters included an increase in forecast peak load from 150,640 MW during the \r\n2024/25 delivery year to 153,883 MW during the 2025/26 delivery year, an increase of over 3,200 MW or 2.2%. FIGURE 2\r\nshows the forecast peak load for the last 10 PJM capacity auctions. \r\n1 PJM’s capacity market years operate from June 1 to May 31 of the following year2025/26 PJM BRA RESULTS & IMPACTS AUGUST 2024\r\n© 2024 ENERGY VENTURES ANALYSIS 6\r\nFIGURE 2: PJM FORECAST PEAK LOAD FOR THE LAST 10 CAPACITY AUCTIONS\r\nAfter years of declining forecast peak load, PJM’s demand forecast has shown a noticeable reversal as the 2025/26 forecast \r\npeak load represents a 2.2% increase over the 2024/25 peak load forecast. According to PJM’s January 2024 load forecast \r\nreport2, the primary drivers in PJM’s increased electricity demand forecast were positive shifts in electrification of the \r\ntransportation sector (i.e., electric vehicles) and a substantial growth in electricity demand from data centers. Specifically, \r\nPJM staff adjusted the demand forecast for anticipated point loads due to data center growth in its American Electric \r\nPower (AEP), Allegheny Power (APS), DOM, and PSEG (PS) zones. FIGURE 3 shows PJM’s updated 2024 load forecast for \r\nthe entire RTO with a comparison to its 2023 load forecast, highlighting the massive electricity demand growth the ISO is \r\nnow projecting over the next decade. \r\nFIGURE 3: PJM'S 2024 RTO ELECTRIC PEAK LOAD FORECAST\r\nBesides the apparent substantial upward shift in forecasts for both summer and winter peaks across the PJM RTO, it is \r\nalso worth noting the noticeable increase in weather-adjusted winter peak demand over the last decade, as more states \r\nwithin the PJM footprint pursue more aggressive GHG emission reduction goals and encourage increased switching from \r\nfossil fuels (e.g., natural gas and oil) to electricity within the residential and commercial heating sectors.

Following the system strains \r\nduring Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022, PJM proposed to increase its IRM target by 3.1 percentage points to 17.8%. \r\nAdditionally, PJM changed the methodology for calculating the FPR for the 2025/26 BRA due to changes in the ELCC of its \r\nparticipating resources, as explained later. During the 2024/25 BRA, the FPR was calculated as follows:\r\nForecast Pool Requirement (FPR) = (1+IRM) *(1- Pool-Wide 5-Year Average Equivalent Forced Outage Rates (EFORd))\r\n2024/25 BRA FPR = (1+14.7%) * (1-5.02%) = 1.0894\r\nHowever, for the 2025/26 BRA, PJM changed the formula to the following:\r\n2025/26 FPR = (1+IRM) * Pool-Wide Accredited Unforced Capacity (UCAP) Factor\r\n2025/26 FPR = (1+17.8%)*79.69% = 0.9387\r\nAs a result, the PJM RTO Reliability Requirement (inclusive of all possible FRR resources) for the 2025/26",

            "PEPCO customers, like those of BGE, will also see a significant rise in electricity prices due to the latest PJM capacity auction for the 2025/26 delivery year. The auction resulted in a capacity price of $269.92/MW-day for most of the PJM region, including PEPCO, which is roughly a 10-fold increase from the previous auction's prices. This hike is driven by a reduced supply of generation (due to plant retirements), increased demand (partly from growing data center and electric vehicle loads), and regulatory changes aimed at ensuring grid reliability during extreme weather events【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】.\n\nAs a result, PEPCO customers can expect a substantial increase in their electricity bills in the coming years as these higher capacity costs are passed through by electricity suppliers. However, the price hike for PEPCO is not as steep as for constrained zones like BGE and Dominion, where prices exceeded $440/MW-day."

So, the increase is from 1 to 6.\n- The percentage increase is calculated by finding the difference between the new value and the original value, dividing that difference by the original value, and then multiplying by 100.\n\nHere's the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{6 - 1}{1} \\times 100 = 500\\%\n\\]\nThis shows that the increase from 1 to 6 is a 500% increase.\n\nIf we say 6 is \"greater\" than 1, it means it's 5 units more than 1, which is 500% greater.

            "The rate changes resulting from the PJM capacity auction will typically be rolled out to consumers through adjustments in their electricity bills, primarily in the capacity cost component. Here’s how it usually works:\n\n1. **Regulatory Approval**: In regulated areas like Maryland, utilities such as BGE and PEPCO submit rate proposals to the state’s Public Service Commission (PSC) for review. The PSC reviews the proposed increases and approves rates based on infrastructure investments, capacity charges, and other factors【9†source】. This ensures that utilities recover their costs while adhering to regulations.\n\n2. **Incremental Increases**: Rather than a one-time drastic increase, the higher rates are often spread out over a few years. For example, utilities might request a multi-year rate plan that includes gradual increases to avoid shocking consumers with a single large hike【9†source】【10†source】.\n\n3. **Capacity Charges**: The increased capacity prices, as seen in the PJM auction, will directly affect consumers through their energy bills as these charges are passed on by electricity suppliers. The higher capacity costs are included in the \"capacity charge\" portion of the bill, which reflects the cost of ensuring sufficient power generation capacity is available during peak demand periods【17†source】.\n\n4. **Reconciliation Adjustments**: In some cases, utilities apply a reconciliation adjustment to account for prior under-recoveries, where they charged less than their actual costs in previous periods. This adjustment ensures that they can recover the full amount over time【9†source】.\n\nConsumers will likely see these changes as a gradual increase in their monthly bills, with specific details about capacity charges, distribution charges, and any adjustments outlined in communication from the utility."

            "For PEPCO customers, the process of rolling out these rate changes will follow a similar path to other utilities in regulated areas. Here’s how it typically works:\n\n1. **Public Service Commission (PSC) Approval**: Like BGE, PEPCO will submit rate increase proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC). These proposals include requests to recover higher capacity costs due to increased PJM auction prices, along with any infrastructure or operational costs【9†source】.\n\n2. **Capacity Charge Adjustments**: The PJM auction results for the 2025/26 delivery year, which saw a substantial price hike, will affect the capacity charges in consumers' bills. PEPCO will pass these increased capacity costs onto customers, which will appear as part of the energy supply charges. These charges reflect the cost of ensuring adequate electricity generation during peak demand【17†source】【16†source】.\n\n3. **Gradual Increases**: To minimize customer impact, utilities like PEPCO may request multi-year rate increases, which spread out the cost increases over several years. This method prevents sudden large jumps in consumer bills and provides a predictable increase over time【9†source】.\n\n4. **Reconciliation Adjustments**: PEPCO may also apply reconciliation adjustments to make up for under-recoveries from previous periods. These adjustments ensure that the utility recovers the full cost of providing service, particularly when expenses were higher than anticipated in prior years【9†source】.\n\nPEPCO will communicate these changes to consumers through bill inserts or other notifications, detailing how the new rates will affect their monthly bills and providing justification for the increases."

Auctions are \nusually held three years in advance of the delivery year. Due to recent \nchanges in market design, among other factors, PJM held the most recent  \nBRA, in July, 2024, for the delivery year starting June 1, 2025 (the BRA \n25/26), with the auction held only about one year in advance of the \nbeginning of the delivery year. PJM currently intends to conduct \nsubsequent BRAs on an accelerated basis to enable returning to the 3-\nyear forward schedule. The BRA is the first auction, in a cycle of several \nauctions for each delivery year underPJM’s Reliability Pricing Model \n(RPM), or capacity market, where the majority of the RPM capacity is \nprocured for a particular delivery year. \n\nCETL Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer Limit \n\nCapacity Emergency Transfer Limit (CETL) is the capability of the \ntransmission system to support deliveries of electric energy to a given \narea (or LDA, see below) experiencing a localized capacity emergency as \ndetermined in accordance with the PJM Manuals. \n\nCETO Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer \nObjective \n\nThe amount of electric energy that a given area (a LDA) must be able to \nimport in order to remain within a loss of load expectation of one event in \n25 years (or its expected unserved energy (EUE) equivalent under the \nnew PJM reliability metrics starting with the 25/26 BRA) when the area is \nexperiencing a localized capacity emergency. \n\nCONE Cost of New \nEntry \n\nCONE represents the total annual net revenue (net of variable operating \ncosts) that a new generation resource would need to recover its capital \ninvestment and fixed costs, given reasonable expectations about future cost \nrecovery over its economic life. CONE is the starting point for estimating the \nNet Cost of New Entry (Net CONE). Net CONE represents the first-year \nrevenues that a new resource would need to earn in the capacity market, \nafter netting out energy and ancillary service (E&AS) margins from CONE. \nThis metric is used in calculating the VRR Curve (see below) which is used \nto define the administrative cost cap to the BRA. \n\nCSRR Cost of Service \nRecovery Rate \n\nOne of two options RMR (see below) owners can elect for cost recovery \nfor an RMR agreement. See text for more details on the CSRR method. \n\nCTR Capacity \nTransfer Rights \n\nA method of allocating the economic value of transmission import \ncapability that exists into a constrained Locational Deliverability Area \n(LDA) to Load Serving Entities (LSEs). \n\nDACR Deactivation \nAvoidable Cost \nRate \n\nOne of two options RMR (see below) owners can elect for cost recovery \nfor an RMR arrangement. See text for more details on the DACR method. \n\nDY Delivery Year The PJM capacity auction procures commitments for a delivery year, \nbeginning June 1 and ending May 30th. The RPM was and is intended to \nprovide for the conduct of each annual capacity auction (or BRA) three \nyears in advance of the beginning of the running of the delivery year \ncommitment procured through the auction. Currently due to slippage \nresulting from multiple causes, PJM just completed the most recent BRA,  \nin July, 2024, for the 25/26 delivery year, which begins at the same time \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  4 \n\n(June 1, 2025) as the scheduled beginning of the Brandon Shores and \nWagner RMR arrangements. The 24/25 delivery year was already \nprocured through a previously completed auction. \n\nE&AS Energy & \nAncillary \nServices \nRevenues \n\nRevenues from the energy and ancillary services markets, which are unit-\nspecific. E&AS are historically netted out of Market Seller Offer Caps, \nand/or Net Cost of New Entry calculations. \n\nEFORd Equivalent \nDemand Forced \nOutage Rate \n\nA measure of the probability that a generating unit will not be available \ndue to a forced outages or forced deratings when there is a demand on \nthe unit to generate. \n\nELCC Effective Load \nCarrying \nCapability \n\nELCC provides a way to assess the capacity value (or reliability \ncontribution) of a resource (or a set of resources) that is tied to the loss-of-\nload probability concept. ELCC can be defined as a measure of the \nadditional load that the system can supply with a particular generator of \ninterest, with no net change in reliability. ELCC can be based on any \nreliability metric (e.g., Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE), Loss of Load \nHours (LOLH), or Expected Unserved Energy (EUE)). PJM shifted from its \nprior use of LOLE to an EUE metric for the most recently completed BRA \n(2025/2026) which was conducted in July, 2024 \n\nEUE Expected \nUnserved \nEnergy \n\nThis is defined as a measure of the resource availability to continuously \nserve all loads at all delivery points while satisfying all planning criteria. \nThe EUE is energy-centric and analyzes all hours of a particular year. \nResults are calculated in megawatt hours (MWh). The EUE is the \nsummation of the expected number of megawatt hours of load that will not \nbe served in a given year as a result of demand exceeding the available \ncapacity across all hours. \n\nFERC Federal Energy \nRegulatory \nCommission \n\nThe federal agency that regulates wholesale electric power sales and \ntransmission rates. \n\nICAP Installed \nCapacity \n\nA MW value based on the summer net dependable capability of a unit and \nwithin the capacity interconnection right limits of the bus to which it is \nconnected. \n\nIMM Independent \nMarket Monitor \n\nPJM's Independent Market Monitor is responsible for guarding against the \nexercise of market power in PJM's markets and assisting in the \nmaintenance of competitive and nondiscriminatory markets in PJM. The \nIMM operates independently from PJM staff and members to objectively \nmonitor, investigate, evaluate, and report on PJM’s markets. Monitoring \nAnalytics serves as PJM’s independent market monitor. \n\nIRM Installed \nReserve Margin \n\nPercentage value used to establish the level of installed capacity \nresources that provide an acceptable level of reliability. \n\nLDA Locational \nDeliverability \nArea \n\nSub-regions of PJM’s “footprint” used to evaluate locational constraints of \nthe electric grid. An LDA is an area or zone within the wholesale electric \nmarkets administered by PJM, in which local effects of transmission, load, \nand generating resources are separately accounted for in the operation of \nPJM’s markets. In this report, costs described as allocated to or incurred \nby a LDA mean costs flowed through to the end-use customers located \nwithin that LDA. Maryland is covered by all or portions of 4 LDAs: the BGE \nLDA, roughly equal to BGE’s retail service area (and entirely within \nMaryland); DPL-South (inclusive of the Maryland eastern shore and \nsouthern Delaware); Pepco LDA, covering the retail service areas of \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  5 \n\nPepco (both Maryland and DC) and SMECO; and the APS LDA (including \nPotomac Edison’s Maryland service area and extending to the retail \nservice areas of PE’s affiliates in West Virginia and Southwest \nPennsylvania). The cost impacts analyzed in this report focus on those \nanticipated for Maryland customers.. \n\nLOLE Loss of Load \nExpectation \n\nLoss-of-load expectation (LOLE) defines the adequacy of capacity for the \nentire PJM footprint based on load exceeding available capacity, on \naverage, only once in 10 years. This is generally defined as the expected \nnumber of days per year for which the available generation capacity is \ninsufficient to serve the daily peak demand. \n\nMSOC Market Seller \nOffer Cap \n\nPJM uses Market Seller Offer Caps to ensure that resources are \nsubmitting competitive offers into the capacity market, thus preventing \nsellers from exerting market power and setting artificially high prices. A \nresource’s MSOC is equivalent to the costs it would avoid if it retired or if it \ndid not clear in the capacity market and did not operate for the delivery \nyear. It is the minimum capacity price a resource needs to take on a \ncapacity obligation and continue operations for another year. \n\nRMR Reliability Must-\nRun \n\nA generating unit slated to be retired by its owners but that is needed for \nreliability reasons. Typically, PJM requests that the unit remain \noperational beyond its proposed retirement date until transmission \nupgrades are completed. \n\nRPM Reliability \nPricing Model \n\nPJM's capacity market design that includes a series of auctions to satisfy \nthe reliability requirements of the PJM region for a Delivery Year. The \nmajority of capacity is procured in the first auction for a particular delivery \nyear, which is known as the Base Residual Auction. This auction is intended \nto be conducted three years in advance of a given delivery year. The RPM \nmodel works in conjunction with PJM’s Regional Transmission Expansion \nPlanning process to ensure the reliability of the PJM region for future years. \n\nRTO Regional \nTransmission \nOrganization \n\nThe organization that coordinates, controls, and monitors a multi-state \nelectric grid. In this report, RTO refers to PJM Interconnection, LLC (or \nPJM) which operates a competitive wholesale electricity market and \nmanages the high-voltage electricity grid to ensure reliability in all or parts \nof Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, \nand the District of Columbia. \n\nUCAP Unforced \nCapacity \n\nThe megawatt (MW) value of a capacity resource in the PJM Capacity \nMarket. PJM currently uses different methods to accredit the amount of \nUCAP specific resource types may offer into the PJM capacity market but \nwas shifted to a marginal ELCC approach for the recently completed BRA \n(for delivery year 2025/2026). \n\nVRR \nCurve \n\nVariable \nResource \nRequirement \n\nA downward sloping demand curve used in the conduct and settlement of \nthe BRA, both PJM wide and for individually constrained LDAs, that \nrelates the maximum price for a given level of capacity resource \ncommitments relative to reliability requirements. \n\nAll definitions above are sourced from the PJM website and its educational materials, as well the North American Electric Reliability \nCorporation (NERC).  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  6 \n\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nPJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), the entity that operates the electricity grid for the Mid-Atlantic \nregion and nearby states, administers a capacity market to assure adequate generation \ncapacity to meet peak loads and reliability standards.1 As part of its responsibilities, PJM \nprocures capacity through annual competitive auctions. On July 30, 2024, PJM released results \nfor its latest capacity market base residual auction (BRA) for the 2025/2026 delivery year that \nruns from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026. The results showed a more than 800 percent increase \nin system-wide prices relative to the prior BRA for the 2024/2025 delivery year, a price spike \nunprecedented in PJM. Across the entire PJM footprint, beginning June 1, 2025, these capacity \nprices will result in a total annual cost to electric customers of $14.7 billion, a substantial \nincrease from the $2.2 billion in capacity costs in the 2024/2025 delivery year. These surging \nprices are driven primarily by (1) increases in load, (2) various market rule changes that, among \nother effects, modify how supply (e.g., generation) is valued in the capacity market, and (3) a \nreduction in capacity market supply due to plant retirements and retirement-related “reliability-\nmust-run” (RMR) arrangements.  The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel commissioned \nSynapse Energy Economics (Synapse) to analyze the likely impacts of the changes in the \ncapacity market and these RMR arrangements on the rates paid by Maryland’s electric utility \ncustomers. \n\nThe capacity market auction is conducted for the entire PJM footprint. Capacity-constrained \nregions, known as locational deliverability areas (LDAs) can sometimes have separate, higher \ncapacity prices from the RTO as a whole. These LDAs exhibit constraints when comparing the \nlocal load within the LDA, the local generation within the LDA, and the PJM-administered \ntransmission system’s ability to transfer power into the LDA. The different, typically higher \nclearing prices for the constrained LDAs reflect the tighter balance of load, local generation, and \ntransmission transfer capacity into the LDA when compared with broader areas of the PJM \nfootprint. \n\nMaryland is included in all or portions of four LDAs:  \n\n• Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE LDA), the only LDA entirely located in Maryland, which \nis comprised of Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BGE) Maryland service territory; \n\n• Allegheny Power System (APS LDA), which covers portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, including the service territory of Potomac Edison, which \nserves customers in Western Maryland, and various municipal utilities in the APS LDA \nfootprint; \n\n \n1 PJM administers other product markets, in addition to the capacity market, that are paid for by electric customers. \nPJM administers the “energy” market for the power consumed by customers continuously over time. It also plans and \nprocures the transmission system within its footprint. In relative terms, the costs of the energy and capacity markets \nand those due to transmission costs are the three principal cost components of wholesale electric costs borne by \nelectric customers. In 2023, they comprised 62%, 8% and 27%, respectively, on average across the PJM footprint of \nwholesale electric costs. With the results of the recent 25/26 BRA discussed further in the report, capacity costs \nbeginning June 1, 2025 will comprise nearly 27% of total wholesale costs (up from 8% in 2023), assuming energy \nand transmission costs remain near 2023 levels. PJM Members Committee, Markets Report, MC Webinar, July 22, \n2024. Item 05A - 2 - Market Operations Report Appendix. Available at: https://www.pjm.com/committees-and-\ngroups/committees/mc.aspx \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  7 \n\n• Delmarva Power South (DPL-South LDA), which covers Maryland and Delaware \nportions of the Delmarva Peninsula, including Maryland utility Delmarva Power; and \n\n• Potomac Electric Power (Pepco LDA), which covers portions of Maryland and \nWashington, D.C., including Maryland utilities Potomac Electric Power (Pepco) and \nSouthern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO). \n\n \n\nExcept for the BGE LDA, the Maryland LDAs cover multiple jurisdictions and encompass other \nutilities within them. For example, the Pepco LDA includes SMECO, which means that the \ncustomer impacts discussed in this report for the Pepco LDA apply equally to SMECO \ncustomers. Similarly, the impacts on DPL-South LDA apply to customers of Delmarva Power & \nLight as well as municipal and cooperative electric utilities on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. \n\nOver the past several years, the BGE LDA has been capacity-constrained and has seen higher \nprices relative to other LDAs. Once again, in the latest base residual auction, for the 2025/2026 \ndelivery year, the BGE LDA was capacity-constrained, and this time it cleared at its maximum \npossible price: $466/MW-day. This is a six-fold increase from the 2024/2025 BGE LDA BRA \nclearing price of $73/MW-day. The APS, DPL-South, and Pepco LDAs all cleared at the same \nclearing price as the full RTO, which saw prices of $270/MW-day, a nine-fold increase from the \nprevious year’s results ($29/MW-day). Electric customers pay for capacity at these prices, \nmeaning that the results of this auction will be seen on the bills of electric customers in \nMaryland starting in 2025 or beyond. In the BGE LDA, the total increase in customer costs from \nthe 2024/2025 to the 2025/2026 BRA auction is $504 million. For the average residential \ncustomer in the BGE LDA, this means an additional $16 per month on their electric bills for at \nleast a year (Table 1). Similarly, average residential customers in APS, DPL-South, and Pepco \nLDAs will see an additional $18, $4, and $14 per month, respectively, on their electric bills \nstarting in 2025 or soon after (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1. Bill and Rate Impacts of the 2025/2026 capacity market relative to 2024/2025, for the \nBGE LDA and the Maryland portion of APS, DPL-South, and Pepco LDAs \n\nMaryland LDAs Monthly Bill Change (%) Additional Costs on Monthly Bills ($) \n\n All Residential Commercial \n\nBGE LDA Customers 14% $16 $170 \n\nAPS LDA Customers \n(Maryland only) \n\n24% $18 $81 \n\nDPL-South LDA Customers \n(Maryland only) \n\n2% $4 $16 \n\nPepco LDA Customers \n(Maryland only) \n\n10% $14 $163 \n\nSource: See description in text.  \n\nThe most notable driver behind BGE LDA’s record high capacity price is the removal of four \ngenerating units from the capacity market, starting in the 2025/2026 delivery year. Specifically, \nin 2023, Talen Energy, the owner of the aging, large, fossil fuel-fired power plants—Brandon \nShores Units 1 & 2 and Wagner Units 3 & 4—announced its intent to retire (or deactivate) the \nplants, effective June 1, 2025. The units are in the BGE LDA, an area already known for its \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  8 \n\nconstrained transmission capacity. PJM determined their retirement could cause grid reliability \nissues until new transmission solutions can be implemented to bring in electricity from other \nareas and to address power quality issues arising when the power plants are retired.  \n\nWhile the transmission solutions are being built (that address the reliability issues arising from \nTalen plant retirements), PJM is arranging for the continued operation of these four units past \ntheir proposed retirement date of June 2025. The plants would operate under a “reliability must \nrun,” or “RMR” arrangement and receive payments—funded through customer rates—outside of \nthe competitive wholesale power markets. RMR service is intended to ensure grid reliability until \nthe transmission grid can be enhanced to eliminate the grid reliability concerns associated with \nthe plant retirements.  \n\nUnder these RMR arrangements, ratepayers will pay the power plants’ owner compensation for \nthe continued operation of the plants under a separate “out of market” regime administered by \nPJM. Importantly, these RMR units do not participate in the capacity market as supply-side \nresources, dramatically reducing supply in the already-constrained BGE LDA. In fact, without \nthese units participating in the capacity market in 2025/2026, less than 10 percent of BGE’s \ncleared capacity was from generation within the BGE LDA, pushing the clearing price for the \nBGE LDA to the capacity price maximum for the LDA.  \n\nThe capacity shortfall in BGE LDA from the conversion of Brandon Shores and Wagner to RMR \nservice also likely had spillover effects into the RTO as a whole, increasing the RTO-wide \nclearing price and impacting customers throughout the region. To determine the effects, we \nconducted a counterfactual analysis of clearing prices in PJM using assumptions described in \nmore detail in section 3.3. We found that if Brandon Shores and Wagner RMR units had \nremained as supply-side resources in the capacity market under those assumptions, the RTO \nas a whole would have cleared at $163.46/MW-day. At that price, electric customers across the \nRTO would save over $5 billion in that delivery year. Further, comparing this counterfactual \nanalysis to the actual results of the capacity market and Talen’s proposed RMR, we found that \nTalen’s revenues for the 2025-2026 delivery year are $360 million higher than what they would \nhave been had Talen’s units participated in the capacity market. \n\nFurthermore, the BGE LDA is now so constrained that the cleared resources and imported \ncapacity did not meet the LDA’s reliability requirement for the 2025/2026 delivery year in this \nauction. The reliability requirement is the target amount of capacity required to meet PJM’s \nreliability standard, i.e., a loss of load probability of no more than once in 25 years for LDAs. In \nthe 2025/2026 delivery year, there is a capacity shortfall of 176 MW relative to the reliability \nrequirement, suggesting that the probability of reliability issues for the BGE LDA could increase \nstarting June 2025, potentially further impacting customers in addition to higher electric rates.  \n\nBecause the Talen units are within the capacity-constrained zone of the BGE LDA (located \nentirely within Maryland), and because the RMR cost allocation follows the cost allocation for \nthe transmission solutions that will eliminate the RMR need, Maryland customers will pay most \nof these out-of-market RMR costs. Currently, PJM projects that the planned transmission \nsolutions will be completed by December 2028, after which the RMR units would no longer be \nneeded. Until that time—or later, if the transmission solutions take longer to construct—\ncustomers of local utilities in these constrained areas will pay millions of dollars for RMR service \nto the power plants’ owner.  \n\nTalen Energy is seeking to recover annual fixed costs of over $215 million for Brandon Shores’ \nand Wagner’s RMR arrangements, combined. These RMRs could cost Maryland’s residents \nand businesses over $629 million through 2028, the earliest by which the RMR arrangements \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  9 \n\ncould end. BGE customers can expect to pay an estimated 74 percent—or roughly $159 million \nper year—of these costs. As a result, BGE customers could see their bills increase by \napproximately 5 percent, resulting in an average residential bill increase of $5 per month due to \nRMR costs alone (Table 2). When combined with the incremental impact of the capacity market \ncosts (Table 1, above), electric customers in the BGE LDA could see average bill increases of \n$21 per month.  \n\nTable 2.

For one, OPC is litigating the amount of recoverable \nRMR costs before FERC. Second, there is uncertainty in the length of time that PJM will use \nthese units for RMR service. PJM has indicated that it requires Brandon Shores to provide RMR \nservice until December 2028, when it projects that the transmission solutions needed to \neliminate the need for the Brandon Shores RMR units will be completed, while the Wagner plant \nmay need to continue providing RMR service beyond 2028. However, if there are major \nchanges to load or other factors that could affect reliability in the region, PJM may determine \nthat Brandon Shores and Wagner need to continue providing reliability service beyond the \ncurrently planned December 2028 date. Lastly, the projected completion date of December \n2028 for these transmission solutions is highly uncertain; there could be delays in the project \nconstruction and execution, further imposing RMR costs on electric customers. If the \ntransmission projects are not complete by the end of 2028, and/or the continued operation of \nthe RMR units are required beyond December of that year, the RMR costs for electric \ncustomers would necessarily increase. \n\nThe length of time that PJM, and especially BGE customers, will continue to see elevated prices \nis also uncertain. The next PJM capacity market auction, for the 2026/2027 delivery year, is set \nto occur in December 2024, less than 5 months from the recently completed 2025/2026 auction, \nmaking it unlikely that there will be any major increases in available supply. Given the long wait \ntimes in processing the interconnection queue (delaying the interconnection of new generating \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  10 \n\nresources to the grid to replace the RMR units) and the uncertainty around queue reform, it is \nunlikely that enough new generation will be under way before December 2024 and online by \nJune 1, 2026 (the start of the 2026/2027 delivery year) to substantially alleviate the very high \nprices seen for the 2025/2026 BRA. In the case of the BGE LDA, these interconnection queue \nbacklogs make it unlikely that any major generation will be interconnected before the end of \n2028, the earliest date for ending the Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s RMR arrangements. Thus, \nthe strong price signal sent by the high capacity market prices in the BGE LDA (and the RTO as \na whole) may not induce timely new generation into service within the LDA before the \ncompletion of the transmission lines that end the need for these RMRs (or to help alleviate \nprices seen across the region). Instead, the clogged queue could lock in a windfall for the \nexisting generating units continuing to operate in the BGE LDA and across the PJM region \ngenerally. \n\nThis report and its calculations of prices and bill impacts is based on the best information \navailable at the time of publication. The nature of the report is necessarily forward looking and \ndepends on the assumptions described within. Because PJM is reviewing its market rules and \nbecause of changing economic conditions, actual future market prices and bill impacts could be \ndifferent. \n\n \n\n2. PJM’S RELIABILITY MUST-RUN \n\nTo understand the impacts to Marylanders of the anticipated RMR arrangements, one needs an \nunderstanding of how RMR arrangements work in PJM. This section provides background on \nthe power plant units at issue and describes how RMR costs are allocated to different locational \ndeliverability areas (LDAs).2 Finally, we describe how, within PJM, RMRs typically interact with \nwholesale capacity and energy markets. \n\n2.1. Background \n\nReliability must-run service is a status applied to a generating unit that enters into an \narrangement with PJM to remain online beyond its slated retirement date to maintain grid \nreliability. RMRs are arrangements a generator owner and PJM enter into for continued \noperation of the generator in exchange for payments outside of the competitive wholesale \npower market. They are referred to as “Part V Reliability Service” in the PJM tariff.3 Typically, \nPJM requests that the RMR unit remain operational beyond the generation plant owner’s \nproposed retirement date, until completion of the transmission upgrades that PJM has deemed \n\n \n2 An LDA is an area or zone within the wholesale electric markets administered by PJM, in which local effects of \ntransmission, load and generating resources are separately accounted for in the operation of PJM’s markets. In this \nreport, costs described as allocated to or incurred by a LDA mean costs flowed through to the end use customers \nlocated within that LDA. Maryland is covered by all or portions of 4 LDAs—the BGE LDA, roughly equal to BGE’s \nretail service area (and entirely within Maryland); DPL-South, inclusive of the Maryland eastern shore and southern \nDelaware; the Pepco LDA, covering the retail service areas of Pepco (both Maryland and DC) and SMECO; and the \nAPS LDA, including Potomac Edison’s Maryland service area and extending to the retail service areas of PE’s \naffiliates in West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania. The cost impacts analyzed in this report focus on those \nanticipated for Maryland customers, although the increases described impacting the cross-jurisdictional LDAs will \nalso adversely affect customers in the other jurisdictions included in these LDAs. \n3 OATT Part V. \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  11 \n\nnecessary to resolve the grid reliability deficiencies which would be caused when and if the \nplant is retired. Out-of-market solutions, such as RMR service arrangements, limit the \neffectiveness of the PJM markets and can lead to high costs for consumers. PJM has engaged \nin 17 RMR arrangements since they were first introduced in PJM in 2005.4  \n\nIndian River 4 (“IR4”), a 410-MW coal plant owned by NRG Power Marketing, is the only unit \ncurrently providing RMR service in PJM and illustrates RMR arrangements. NRG announced its \nintent to retire IR4 as of June 1, 2022. Before that planned retirement date, PJM deemed the \nplant’s continued operation necessary for grid reliability. Under PJM’s plans, the transmission \nbuilds to address reliability issues resulting from the retirement of IR4 require a capital \ninvestment of $51 million,5 while NRG’s RMR revenue requirements for IR4, as reflected in a \ncontested settlement agreement currently pending before FERC for approval, are $228 million \nover the  proposed term of the RMR arrangement (June 1, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2026).6 NRG \noriginally proposed fixed RMR revenue requirements of $357 million; these were contested at \nFERC by some PJM customer advocates and representatives, including the Maryland Office of \nPeople’s Counsel. The lower RMR costs, as reflected in the contested settlement pending at \nFERC, are the result of that litigation and settlement, assuming approval of the settlement by \nFERC. \n\nThis paper focuses on the cost impacts of the future RMR arrangements that PJM is entering \ninto with Talen Energy for its Brandon Shores and Herbert A. Wagner (Wagner) power plants. \n\n• Brandon Shores. On April 6, 2023, PJM received Talen Energy’s deactivation notice for \nBrandon Shores, a 1,282 MW coal-fired power plant in Maryland’s BGE zone, proposing \nthe retirement of the plant on June 1, 2025.7 PJM assessed the deactivation, and stated \nthat without Brandon Shores, severe voltage drop and thermal violations could occur \nacross seven PJM zones, which could lead to a widespread voltage collapse in \nBaltimore and the surrounding areas.8 PJM has said that these reliability issues can only \nbe addressed through needed transmission system upgrades. The Grid Solutions \nPackage addressing these shortcomings was approved by the FERC in November 2023 \nand is slated to be in service by December 31, 2028.9 For the interim period until the \ntransmission upgrades are complete, PJM requested that Brandon Shores remain in \n\n \n4 Deactivation Enhancements Senior Task Force, February 15, 2024 Meeting, Agenda Item 3 – RMR History. \nMonitoring Analytics, LLC. \n5 Public Service Commission of Maryland, Order 90950, December 5, 2023.

These avoidable costs are defined as “incremental expenses directly required for the \noperation of a generating unit” and include “project investments” (capital expenditures needed to keep the plant \noperating) of up to $2 million. The incentive adder escalates for each year of service (10 percent of expenses in the \nfirst year, 20 percent in the second year, 35 percent in the third year, and 50 percent in the fourth year and beyond). If \nthe owner of an RMR unit decides to continue operations after the RMR arrangement term ends, the tariff requires \nthat project investments that were required for RMR service be repaid to PJM. \n17 More information on the two cost recovery approaches can be found at: Deactivation Enhancements Senior Task \nForce, October 12, 2023.

The \ninitial terms of both RMR arrangement tariff filings extend to December 2028, after which PJM \nanticipates transmission solutions should be in place to eliminate the need for RMR service.19 \nHowever, there is significant uncertainty around this date, as there are numerous factors that \ncould delay the construction and completion of these transmission solutions.

Historically, final RMR costs are on average 25 percent less than the initial filing for \nplants using CSRR.20 For instance, Indian River 4 (or IR4), described above as the only unit \ncurrently providing RMR service in PJM, used the CSRR approach. Its owner, NRG Power \nMarketing, initially proposed an RMR cost of $520/MW-day.21 As a result of litigation at FERC \nand as incorporated into a proposed settlement filed at FERC, IR4’s revenue requirements for \nRMR service are $333/MW-day.22 This revenue requirement remains subject to challenge by \nthe Maryland OPC and PJM’s Independent Market Monitor and is pending a FERC decision. \nThe comparison between the initial filing and the litigated outcome over the history of RMRs in \nPJM is useful, but not dispositive of predicting the particular outcome in any RMR proceeding \nlitigated at FERC, given the widely varying specific circumstances and levels of cost support \nacross each of the RMR proceedings.  \n\nIn addition, total whole-term costs, as presented in Table 3, depend on timely completion of \nPJM’s planned transmission solutions on or before the planned date of December 31, 2028. The \n\n \n19 The end date or Wagner’s RMR arrangement is less certain; PJM may require Wagner to continue RMR service \nbeyond December 2028 (even if Brandon Shores’ arrangement terminates on that date as currently planned). \n20 Based on a simple average in $/MW-day across all RMR Arrangements that started June 1, 2011 or later.

If they are not completed on time, however, \nit is likely PJM would seek to extend the RMR terms beyond 2028, adding further RMR costs for \ncustomers. The RMRs could also be extended as a result of changes in load forecasts; if \nforecasts go up, PJM could determine the RMRs are needed past 2028 to mitigate related \nreliability impacts.  \n\nCost Allocation to Maryland LDAs \n\nAs described in PJM’s tariff, RMR costs are allocated to the “load in the Zone(s) of the \nTransmission Owner(s) that will be assigned financial responsibility for the reliability upgrades \nnecessary to alleviate the reliability impact that would result from the Deactivation of the \ngenerating unit.”24 FERC approved the Brandon Shores Grid Solutions Package at the end of \n2023. The package includes transmission upgrades PJM deemed necessary to maintain \nreliability following the deactivation of Brandon Shores.25 We assumed Brandon Shores RMR \ncosts are allocated proportionally to the cost allocation of that same Grid Solutions Package, \nwhich affects all Maryland LDAs (BGE, Pepco, DPL-South, and APS)26 (Table 4). PJM has not \nindicated what transmission upgrades are required to alleviate the reliability impact of Wagner. \nWithout more accurate information, we assumed that RMR costs for the Wagner plant would \nalso be allocated according to the approved Brandon Shores Grid Solutions Package.27  \n\nTable 4.

As shown in Table 4, Maryland customers in the Pepco LDA pay for \n7 percent of the PJM total, while customers in the remaining two Maryland LDAs (APS, DPL-\nSouth) pay less than 1.5 percent of the costs together. In total, Maryland customers pay roughly \n81 percent of the total RMR costs for Brandon Shores (Units 1 and 2) and Wagner (Units 3 and \n4)—$176 million per year and $630 million over 3.5 years. As discussed, final revenue \nrequirements of these RMR units may be lower as a result of litigation at FERC.   \n\n2.3. Treatment of RMRs in the Capacity and Energy Markets \n\nPJM’s capacity market is meant to secure capacity commitments—in megawatts (MW)—from \ngeneration plant owners, with the intention of securing future reliability. Like any market, prices \nset by the capacity market depend on buyers and sellers. For example, a smaller number of \nbidders offering fewer megawatts of capacity into the capacity market lowers supply and could \nincrease prices paid by wholesale buyers—and ultimately by utility retail customers. As further \nexplained below in Section 3.1, PJM’s capacity market prices are set in an annual auction and \nare based on supply (generation plant owner bids)28 and reliability requirements. The clearing \nprice, or the intercept point between supply and demand, is the price that is paid to all \ngeneration plant owners that successfully cleared in the market.  \n\nBrandon Shores and Wagner have participated in the capacity market and are committed to \nprovide capacity through to their proposed deactivation dates of June 1, 2025.  RMR unit \nparticipation in the capacity market, however, depends on the unit’s specific RMR arrangement \nwith PJM.29 Although PJM has designated RMR units to be needed for grid reliability purposes, \nPJM has not required them to make commitments in the capacity market. PJM and the IMM \ninformed us that nearly all, if not all, of the past 17 RMRs have not participated in PJM’s \ncapacity market, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM).30 Neither Brandon Shores nor Wagner \nparticipated in the most recent 2025/2026 capacity market auction and are not expected to \nparticipate in future auctions. As discussed in Section 3.3 below, their absence affected the \ncapacity market auction and clearing price for the delivery year 2025/2026 in the BGE LDA, \nwhere they are located,31 and very likely the capacity price for the entire RTO footprint. \n\nFor an LDA that is already constrained, such as the BGE LDA—and without additional \ntransmission upgrades or new generation to address constraints—if a unit no longer provides \nsupply in the capacity market, clearing prices are pushed upwards. BGE LDA cleared at its \nmaximum price for the 2025/2026 delivery year, evidence of this upward push on clearing \nprices. A higher capacity price provides a market signal to generators, incentivizing new \ngeneration in that zone. Yet when combined with the out-of-market cost of the RMR itself, the \nelevated capacity clearing price ultimately costs utility customers in that LDA.  \n\nPJM can dispatch and schedule Brandon Shores (Units 1 and 2) and Wagner (Units 3 and 4) for \nreliability purposes, subject to their specific operational restrictions. As proposed by Talen in its \n\n \n28 As well as energy efficiency and demand response resources. \n29 RMR units are modeled in reliability studies and reserve calculations. \n30 Based on conversations with PJM and the IMM at the Deactivation Enhancements Senior Task Force November 9, \n2023, meeting. \n31 The presence of the RMR units also impacts the computation of CETO and CETL, and thus has an indirect effect \non the parameters influencing the auction outcome. \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  16 \n\nfilings at FERC, the units will be offered into the energy market “with a status of ‘unavailable in \nthe Market’ but will be available to be dispatched and scheduled by PJM”.32 However, Talen has \nstated that it does “not guarantee the availability of the Unit(s) in response to a PJM scheduling \nor dispatch notice.”33,34  \n\n \n\n3. PJM’S CAPACITY MARKET \n\nIn the most recent PJM capacity auction, for the delivery year 2025/2026, the BGE LDA cleared \nat its maximum price of $466.35/MW-day. The rest of the RTO (with the exception of Dominion \nLDA) cleared at $269.92/MW-day, nine times higher than the RTO clearing price for 2024/2025.  \nThis section provides an overview of how the capacity market works, particularly around the \ncapacity-constrained zones such as the BGE LDA. We also describe recent reforms to the \nmarket and the multiple ways they can affect market prices. Finally, we discuss the impact of \nthe Brandon Shores and Wagner units no longer bidding into PJM’s capacity market, even while \ncontinuing service under RMR arrangements. \n\n3.1. Capacity Market Mechanisms \n\nPJM’s capacity market, known as the Reliability Pricing Model (or RPM), is the market-based \nmechanism that PJM uses to procure commitments from capacity resources to be available to \nmeet future demand. The capacity market is meant to procure capacity at the lowest possible \ncost; it includes generation, storage, demand response, and energy efficiency resources. The \nquantity procured must meet system and local reliability standards, which PJM has historically \ndefined as a loss of load expectation (LOLE) of no more than one day in ten years, or a 1-in-10 \nLOLE for the system, and a 1-in-25 LOLE for LDAs. In other words, to meet reliability standards, \nload should not exceed available capacity more than one day in 10 years. In the just completed \nbase residual auction for the 25/26 delivery year (and for future auctions), PJM shifted its \nmeasure of resource adequacy risk to an expected unserved energy (EUE) metric,35 which is \n\n \n32 FERC Docket No. ER24-1790-000, Brandon Shores Continuing Operates Rate Schedule (CORS) Transmittal \nLetter.

PJM states that the current LOLE reliability criterion \ndoes not fully represent the three typical reliability dimensions: magnitude (MW), duration (hours), and frequency \n(numbers of events per time period). In contrast, PJM states that EUE provides a much more granular metric that \nallows the resource adequacy analysis to clearly differentiate among events of different duration and magnitude, and \nto better identify the scope of loss of load risk throughout the year. Further, PJM argues that the changing resource \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  17 \n\nstill tied to meeting the one day in ten years (or 25 years) reliability metric. PJM expresses this \nreliability requirement as forecasted peak load plus a reserve margin. PJM conducts annual \nauctions to procure capacity and maintain reliability, starting with the Base Residual Auction \n(BRA) and subsequent incremental auctions. The capacity clearing price is the intercept point \nbetween the demand curve and the supply curve; the clearing price is paid to all cleared \ncapacity resources for that delivery year.  \n\nPJM uses a downward sloping demand curve, called the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) \ncurve, to specify prices and demand relative to the reserve margin requirements. To set the \nVRR curve, PJM conducts its annual Reserve Requirement Study. The study is a probabilistic \nrisk modeling exercise that incorporates load forecasts, generation capabilities and outage \nrates, and other factors to determine the Installed Reserve Margin (IRM) necessary to meet the \nreliability standard (1-in-10 LOLE equivalency). Once approved by the PJM Board, the outputs \nof the study define the Reliability Requirement, which is used to determine the three points that \nmake up the VRR Curve (points A, B, and C)36 (Figure 1, with Pepco LDA as an example). The \nmaximum price on the VRR curve is 1.5 times the net Cost of New Entry (CONE);37 net CONE \nis the estimated price that a new generation resource would need to enter the market, net of \nenergy market revenues.  \n\n \nmix, which increasingly will be composed of resources with greater hourly performance variability, further supports \nthe need to include EUE in resource adequacy risk modeling.”  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, January 30, \n2024.

The UCAP is a measure of how much capacity a unit has at peak to \ncontribute to system reliability. PJM has previously used a few capacity accreditation methods, \nspecific to resource types.38 But starting with the latest capacity auction (2025/2026), PJM shifted \nto a marginal Effective Load Carrying Capability approach (ELCC). ELCC accredits resources \nbased on their marginal contribution to system resource adequacy across simulated scenarios.39 \nExisting market participants are required to offer their UCAP at a price that reflects the costs they \nwould avoid by not operating. This price is defined by Market Seller Offer Cap (MSOC) rules. New \nmarket participants can enter at a price of zero (price takers) or at prices that reflect their net costs \nof entering. Each supply offer (UCAP quantity and price) makes up the supply curve. The capacity \nprice is set at the intercept point of the supply and demand curves. \n\nThe capacity market clearing price produces a market signal for capacity resources; high prices \nindicate that supply is scare and encourages entry of new resources, while low prices indicate \nthat there is more supply than the system needs for resource adequacy. The capacity market \nauction is designed to cost-effectively procure capacity to meet reliability requirements for both \nthe entire RTO region as well as LDAs.  \n\n \n38 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, January 30, 2024.

When an LDA is import-constrained, it can experience price separation from its parent \nLDA(s). Within the nested structure of the market, a clearing price in a child LDA is never lower \nthan its parent LDA’s clearing price.41 If a child LDA does not have sufficient local capacity to \nmeet its local peak, and transmission constraints prevent the LDA from importing enough \ncapacity to make up the difference, a higher-cost resource might set the price for the child LDA \nat a higher clearing price than its parent LDA. In other words, instead of the child LDA clearing \nwith its parent LDA at the parent LDA clearing price, it clears at a higher price. This has \noccurred in recent years in BGE LDA, relative to its parent LDA, SWMAAC. BGE LDA \nseparated and experienced a higher price than its parent LDA over the last six auctions. On the \nother hand, the Pepco LDA, which is also part of SWMAAC, did not experience price \nseparation. SWMAAC LDA itself cleared with its own parent, MAAC LDA, or the RTO as a \nwhole (Figure 4).  \n\n \n41 Newell A., Oates, D., Pfeifenberger, J., Spees, K., Hagerty, J.M., Pedtke, J., Witkin, M., Shorin, E.

Recent Capacity Market Reforms in PJM \n\nOn January 30, 2024, FERC approved major reforms to PJM’s capacity market, which were \nimplemented in the most recent BRA (2025/2026) which occurred in July 2024.42 Although these \nchanges are wide-ranging and impact many components of the market, the three main reforms \nrelevant here are: (1) replacement of the current accreditation approach with a marginal ELCC \naccreditation approach for all generation capacity resources, (2) enhancement of PJM’s \nresource adequacy risk modeling to evaluate risk on a more granular, hourly level, and (3) \nadjustments to how Net CONE is calculated.  \n\nMarket Reform Impact on UCAP \n\nCapacity accreditation is the process of determining a given resource’s UCAP, or the amount of \ncapacity a resource can provide after accounting for factors like forced outages and intermittency. \nStarting in the delivery year 2025/2026 (and implemented with the just completed auction for that \ndelivery year), PJM shifts to a marginal ELCC approach for capacity accreditation, which accredits \nthese resources based on their marginal contribution to system resource adequacy across a \nnumber of simulated scenarios (given the anticipated resource mix).

The accreditation methodology impacts natural gas plants and solar \ngenerators the most. Therefore, LDAs with a large quantity of solar and gas see the largest \ndecrease in their UCAP supply. For example, in the 2024/2025 BRA, natural gas resources \nmade up 81 percent of cleared UCAP in Pepco LDA, but only 13 percent of cleared UCAP \ncapacity in BGE LDA.43 However, together these two LDAs make up SWMAAC; gas plants \nrepresented over 40 percent of cleared UCAP in SWMAAC in the 2024/2025 auction.44 As a \nresult, the BGE LDA may not see a major difference in supplied UCAP due to the ELCC \nadjustments (barring additional retirements), while SWMAAC may see a much larger impact on \nits available UCAP as a result of PJM’s new capacity accreditation approach.45  \n\nMarket Reform Impact on Offer Price \n\nChanges in supplied UCAP in turn affect units’ offer prices. If a unit’s UCAP decreases under \nthe new accreditation approach, its fixed unit costs will not—it still needs to recover the same \ntotal dollar amount for the equivalent offer under the new accreditation. For instance, consider \nan 8 MW UCAP resource that previously bid in at $50/MW-day, reflecting costs of $400/day; if \nnow accredited at 5 MW UCAP, the offer would be adjusted to $80/MW-day resulting in the \n\n \n43 Calvert Cliffs is physically located in BGE LDA but is modeled in its parent LDA, SWMAAC LDA.

This shift occurs for several reasons. PJM \nhas adopted hourly probabilistic modeling for its Reserve Requirement Study, which ultimately \ndefines the reliability requirements and the VRR curve. PJM states that this change, along with \nenhanced risk modeling, will improve the accuracy and confidence in the Installed Reserve \nMargin and Reliability Requirement. In effect, the accredited (UCAP) capacity required for the \nRTO as a whole, as well as every child LDA, decreases. Since each megawatt of nameplate \ncapacity (ICAP) is being accredited in a more rigorous and accurate manner, each megawatt of \nfirm capacity (UCAP) is worth more. Therefore, PJM will need to procure less firm capacity to \nmeet reliability requirements. For example, the reliability requirement for the 2025/2026 capacity \nauction decreased by 8 percent for the BGE LDA relative to the 2024/2025 delivery year.48 \n\nImportantly, reducing the reliability requirement shifts the VRR curve to the left (down in \nquantity), as the VRR curve of each LDA is based on its reliability requirement. The VRR price \npoints also increase, as Net CONE will be tied to the ELCC of the reference resource, rather \nthan a pool-wide average forced outage rate. 49 Specifically, Net CONE is converted to $/MW-\nday (UCAP) using the ELCC class rating of the Reference Resource, rather than using the pool-\nwide average effective forced outage rate (EFORd). This conversion results in a higher Net \nCONE.50 The higher Net CONE is important because the maximum capacity market clearing \nprice under PJM rules is 1.5 times the Net CONE value.  These changes to the VRR curve were \nimplemented in the 2025/2026 capacity auction.51 \n\nFinally, PJM has changed how it models reliability import requirements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nPJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), the entity that operates the electricity grid for the Mid-Atlantic \nregion and nearby states, administers a capacity market to assure adequate generation \ncapacity to meet peak loads and reliability standards.1 As part of its responsibilities, PJM \nprocures capacity through annual competitive auctions. On July 30, 2024, PJM released results \nfor its latest capacity market base residual auction (BRA) for the 2025/2026 delivery year that \nruns from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026. The results showed a more than 800 percent increase \nin system-wide prices relative to the prior BRA for the 2024/2025 delivery year, a price spike \nunprecedented in PJM. Across the entire PJM footprint, beginning June 1, 2025, these capacity \nprices will result in a total annual cost to electric customers of $14.7 billion, a substantial \nincrease from the $2.2 billion in capacity costs in the 2024/2025 delivery year. These surging \nprices are driven primarily by (1) increases in load, (2) various market rule changes that, among \nother effects, modify how supply (e.g., generation) is valued in the capacity market, and (3) a \nreduction in capacity market supply due to plant retirements and retirement-related “reliability-\nmust-run” (RMR) arrangements.  The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel commissioned \nSynapse Energy Economics (Synapse) to analyze the likely impacts of the changes in the \ncapacity market and these RMR arrangements on the rates paid by Maryland’s electric utility \ncustomers. \n\nThe capacity market auction is conducted for the entire PJM footprint. Capacity-constrained \nregions, known as locational deliverability areas (LDAs) can sometimes have separate, higher \ncapacity prices from the RTO as a whole. These LDAs exhibit constraints when comparing the \nlocal load within the LDA, the local generation within the LDA, and the PJM-administered \ntransmission system’s ability to transfer power into the LDA. The different, typically higher \nclearing prices for the constrained LDAs reflect the tighter balance of load, local generation, and \ntransmission transfer capacity into the LDA when compared with broader areas of the PJM \nfootprint. \n\nMaryland is included in all or portions of four LDAs:  \n\n• Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE LDA), the only LDA entirely located in Maryland, which \nis comprised of Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BGE) Maryland service territory; \n\n• Allegheny Power System (APS LDA), which covers portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, including the service territory of Potomac Edison, which \nserves customers in Western Maryland, and various municipal utilities in the APS LDA \nfootprint;\n# 【1†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nPSNORTH $54.95 $269.92 \n\nDPLSOUTH $426.17 $269.92 \n\nPEPCO $49.49 $269.92 \n\nATSI $28.92 $269.92 \n\nATSI-CLEVELAND $28.92 $269.92 \n\nCOMED $28.92 $269.92 \n\nBGE $73.00 $466.35 \n\nPL $49.49 $269.92 \n\nDAYTON $28.92 $269.92 \n\nDEOK $96.24 $269.92 \n\nDOM $28.92 $444.26 \n\nNotes: DPL-South 2024/2025 clearing price was originally $90.64/MW-day.

PJM’s RPM Base Residual Auction Results for 2024/2025 and 2025/2026, available at: \nhttps://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/rpm \n\nPJM points to three key factors driving these unprecedented price spikes:57 \n\n• Load: forecasted peak load increased by 3,243 MW (e.g. from new data centers). \n\n• Retirements: actual retirements across the PJM footprint, RMR units participating as \nenergy-only resources (i.e., Brandon Shores, Wagner and Indian River), and must-offer \nexceptions for units preparing to retire.  \n\n• Reductions in UCAP supply due to the new capacity accreditation methods: as \ndiscussed in 3.2, updated ELCC ratings have reduced the total amount of supply, in \nUCAP terms. \n\n \n\nThe capacity shortfall in BGE LDA from the conversion of Brandon Shores and Wagner to RMR \nservice likely had spillover effects into the RTO as a whole, increasing the RTO-wide clearing \nprice and impacting electric customers in PJM beyond those in the BGE LDA. We conducted a \ncounterfactual analysis of clearing prices in PJM, and found that if Brandon Shores and Wagner \nRMR units had remained as supply-side resources in the capacity market, the RTO as a whole \n\n \n57 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction Report.

The VRR price \npoints also increase, as Net CONE will be tied to the ELCC of the reference resource, rather \nthan a pool-wide average forced outage rate. 49 Specifically, Net CONE is converted to $/MW-\nday (UCAP) using the ELCC class rating of the Reference Resource, rather than using the pool-\nwide average effective forced outage rate (EFORd). This conversion results in a higher Net \nCONE.50 The higher Net CONE is important because the maximum capacity market clearing \nprice under PJM rules is 1.5 times the Net CONE value.  These changes to the VRR curve were \nimplemented in the 2025/2026 capacity auction.51 \n\nFinally, PJM has changed how it models reliability import requirements. PJM will adopt hourly \nprobabilistic modeling to model the Capacity Emergency Transfer Objective (CETO). CETO is \nthe required transfer amount to satisfy an LDA’s reliability requirements. This change could \nimpact which LDAs are considered constrained and must be modeled separately from the rest \nof the RTO.  \n\n \n46 PJM Market Implementation Committee. January 10, 2024.

Specifically, \nin 2023, Talen Energy, the owner of the aging, large, fossil fuel-fired power plants—Brandon \nShores Units 1 & 2 and Wagner Units 3 & 4—announced its intent to retire (or deactivate) the \nplants, effective June 1, 2025. The units are in the BGE LDA, an area already known for its \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  8 \n\nconstrained transmission capacity. PJM determined their retirement could cause grid reliability \nissues until new transmission solutions can be implemented to bring in electricity from other \nareas and to address power quality issues arising when the power plants are retired.  \n\nWhile the transmission solutions are being built (that address the reliability issues arising from \nTalen plant retirements), PJM is arranging for the continued operation of these four units past \ntheir proposed retirement date of June 2025. The plants would operate under a “reliability must \nrun,” or “RMR” arrangement and receive payments—funded through customer rates—outside of \nthe competitive wholesale power markets. RMR service is intended to ensure grid reliability until \nthe transmission grid can be enhanced to eliminate the grid reliability concerns associated with \nthe plant retirements.  \n\nUnder these RMR arrangements, ratepayers will pay the power plants’ owner compensation for \nthe continued operation of the plants under a separate “out of market” regime administered by \nPJM. Importantly, these RMR units do not participate in the capacity market as supply-side \nresources, dramatically reducing supply in the already-constrained BGE LDA. In fact, without \nthese units participating in the capacity market in 2025/2026, less than 10 percent of BGE’s \ncleared capacity was from generation within the BGE LDA, pushing the clearing price for the \nBGE LDA to the capacity price maximum for the LDA.\n# 【4†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nIn PJM’s BRA for the 2025/2026 delivery year, which was finalized in July 2024, capacity market \nprices increased substantially in 2025/2026 from the previous delivery year. Specifically, the RTO \nprice increased by over 800 percent, while the price for BGE LDA increased by over 500 percent \n(Table 7). In 2025/2026, only BGE and DOM LDAs experienced price separation, and both \ncleared at their maximum. These RTO and LDA prices are record highs, never before seen in \nPJM.

Recent Capacity Market Reforms in PJM \n\nOn January 30, 2024, FERC approved major reforms to PJM’s capacity market, which were \nimplemented in the most recent BRA (2025/2026) which occurred in July 2024.42 Although these \nchanges are wide-ranging and impact many components of the market, the three main reforms \nrelevant here are: (1) replacement of the current accreditation approach with a marginal ELCC \naccreditation approach for all generation capacity resources, (2) enhancement of PJM’s \nresource adequacy risk modeling to evaluate risk on a more granular, hourly level, and (3) \nadjustments to how Net CONE is calculated.  \n\nMarket Reform Impact on UCAP \n\nCapacity accreditation is the process of determining a given resource’s UCAP, or the amount of \ncapacity a resource can provide after accounting for factors like forced outages and intermittency. \nStarting in the delivery year 2025/2026 (and implemented with the just completed auction for that \ndelivery year), PJM shifts to a marginal ELCC approach for capacity accreditation, which accredits \nthese resources based on their marginal contribution to system resource adequacy across a \nnumber of simulated scenarios (given the anticipated resource mix).

Due to the wide variability in industrial customer types, they were not included in this rate impact \nanalysis  \n\n \n\n5. LOOKING FORWARD BEYOND THE 2025/2026 DELIVERY YEAR \n\nFor the BGE LDA, PJM suggests that the reliability issues and transmission constraints \nassociated with Brandon Shores and Wagner will be mitigated by the end of 2028 once \ntransmission solutions are in place. That outcome is by no means a certainty. Project delays \nrelated to these factors may very well mean the BGE LDA could face reliability constraints after \n2028, thus incurring even more costs for customers. In addition, PJM has been struggling with a \nmassive backlog of new project interconnections, while at the same time working towards \ncompliance with new and anticipated FERC reforms. These factors complicate the development \nof new generation within the BGE LDA and throughout PJM, which would help alleviate the very \nhigh capacity prices seen in the latest auction for the BGE LDA and across the RTO. \nUnfortunately, we are unlikely to see any major relief by 2026/2027, as that delivery year’s \ncapacity auction is scheduled for December 2024, less than five months after the completion of \nthe July 2024 auction for 2025/2026 and only 1 ½ years before the beginning of the delivery \nyear for that auction (leaving a very tight timeline for constructing a new plant).  \n\nAccording to PJM, if there are no delays, it will take a customer in the interconnection queue \nabout 10 months from queue entry for an impact study to be tendered. The full timeline from \nqueue entry to final agreement is between 2.25 and 2.54 years as reported by PJM.68 However, \nthat timeline has not been accurate for at least the past few years.  \n\n \n68 PJM Learning Center, “Connecting to the Grid FAQs.” Available at: https://learn.pjm.com/three-priorities/planning-\nfor-the-future/connecting-grid/how-long-does-the-interconnection-process-take  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  32\n# 【8†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nAffordability Baseline\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBill and Rate Impacts of \nPJM’s 2025/2026 \nCapacity Market Results \n& Reliability Must-Run \nUnits in Maryland \n       \n\n \n\n         August 2024 \n\n(corrected 8/29/24) \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  2 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS   \n\nGlossary................................................................................................................................ 3 \n\n1.

Auctions are \nusually held three years in advance of the delivery year. Due to recent \nchanges in market design, among other factors, PJM held the most recent  \nBRA, in July, 2024, for the delivery year starting June 1, 2025 (the BRA \n25/26), with the auction held only about one year in advance of the \nbeginning of the delivery year. PJM currently intends to conduct \nsubsequent BRAs on an accelerated basis to enable returning to the 3-\nyear forward schedule. The BRA is the first auction, in a cycle of several \nauctions for each delivery year underPJM’s Reliability Pricing Model \n(RPM), or capacity market, where the majority of the RPM capacity is \nprocured for a particular delivery year. \n\nCETL Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer Limit\n# 【9†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nWhen considering both the capacity market impact and the RMR service arrangement costs \ntogether, total bills are likely to increase by 19 percent—an extra $21 on the average residential \ncustomer bill and $224 on the average commercial monthly bill (Table 7). Over the course of a \nyear, that could result in residential electric customers paying an additional $247 annually, and \ncommercial customers paying $2,685 of additional costs. Customers will likely feel these costs \nimpacts until at least December 2028, when PJM has planned for the transmission solutions to \nbe in place (but the timeline for transmission solution completion is highly uncertain). Once the \ntransmission projects are complete (assuming no other reliability issues), the RMRs will no \nlonger be needed for reliability, and the BGE LDA will be able to mitigate high capacity prices by \nimporting lower-priced capacity from neighboring LDAs. In addition, before 2028, additional \ndemand response or generating resources may offer into the market, partially mitigating \ncapacity price increases in the BGE LDA. However, given that the next auction (for 2026/2027) \nis less than five months from the latest auction (2025/2026) and the beginning of that auction’s \ndelivery year is only 1 ½ years following its completion, it is unlikely that there will be any \nchange to BGE LDA capacity price until at least 2027/2028.  \n\n \n65 Industrial customers are excluded from this analysis, due to the wide variation in energy use and monthly bills. \n66 Capacity costs are only a small portion of a customer’s electric bill.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  30 \n\nTable 7.

These \nunprecedented costs will ultimately be passed onto customers, with major impacts felt in \nMaryland.

APS LDA generally clears with the RTO, meaning that in the previous auction the \nclearing price was $29/MW-day, while Pepco LDA cleared with MAAC at $49/MW-day. In the \n2024/2025 BRA, DPL-South LDA separated at $426/MW-day,67 but cleared with the RTO in the \n2025/2026 BRA at $270/MW-day. The fact that the APS LDA historically has cleared at the \nlowest price—and has benefitted from the lowest past capacity prices—helps explain why the \nAPS LDA has the largest bill impact relative to the other Maryland LDAs, including BGE’s LDA. \nIn addition, CTRs are used to help mitigate the customer impact of higher-priced capacity in \nconstrained LDAs (e.g. BGE’s), which also helps to explain why the BGE bill impact is not \nmagnitudes higher than that of the APS and Pepco LDAs, despite the extreme capacity clearing \nprice in the BGE LDA. CTRs also insulated electric customers from the high clearing prices in \nDPL-South LDA in 2024/2025, which results in only a small bill increase for DPL-South LDA \ncustomers between 2024/2025 and 2025/2026.\n# 【11†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  25 \n\ncapacity that can be imported on the existing transmission system, and the cleared price \nresponsive demand totals 6,765 MW, which is 176 MW below the LDA’s reliability requirement \nof 6,941 MW. BGE LDA’s capacity shortfall relative to its reliability requirement suggests that \nthe probability of a loss of load event in the LDA is higher than PJM’s reliability standard, further \nimpacting electric customers in that zone. \n\nBeyond the 2025/2026 delivery year, the very high prices may incentivize more demand \nresponse resources to bid into the market, which could reduce the clearing price if there is \nenough demand response to exceed the minimum required UCAP. Similarly, the high prices are \nin theory meant to incentivize new generation in the LDA. However, as discussed in Section 5, \nthe years-long interconnection queue delays in PJM will likely prevent a large amount of \nresources from interconnecting in the BGE LDA any time soon. Without major changes to \ntransmission import capacity or generation capacity, prices are likely going to remain at very \nelevated levels (even if not at the maximum of 1.5 times Net CONE, Point A). High prices are \nespecially likely for PJM’s next capacity auction (for the 2026/2027 delivery year) because it will \noccur in December 2024—less than five months following the BRA for 2025/2026 and only 1 ½ \nyears before the beginning of the delivery year for that next auction. Likewise, the possibility of \nreliability issues in the BGE LDA as a result of the capacity shortfall will likely be an ongoing \nconcern until more capacity becomes available and the reliability requirements are achieved, via \nnew generation, demand response, or upgraded transmission capacity.  \n\nRTO and other LDA Capacity Market Prices in 2025/2026 \n\nIn PJM’s BRA for the 2025/2026 delivery year, which was finalized in July 2024, capacity market \nprices increased substantially in 2025/2026 from the previous delivery year. Specifically, the RTO \nprice increased by over 800 percent, while the price for BGE LDA increased by over 500 percent \n(Table 7). In 2025/2026, only BGE and DOM LDAs experienced price separation, and both \ncleared at their maximum. These RTO and LDA prices are record highs, never before seen in \nPJM.  The total RTO-wide cost to electric customers increased from $2.2 billion in 2024/2025 to \n$14.7 billion in 2025/2026.56 \n\n \n56 PJM 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction Report. July 30, 2024.

This shift occurs for several reasons. PJM \nhas adopted hourly probabilistic modeling for its Reserve Requirement Study, which ultimately \ndefines the reliability requirements and the VRR curve. PJM states that this change, along with \nenhanced risk modeling, will improve the accuracy and confidence in the Installed Reserve \nMargin and Reliability Requirement. In effect, the accredited (UCAP) capacity required for the \nRTO as a whole, as well as every child LDA, decreases. Since each megawatt of nameplate \ncapacity (ICAP) is being accredited in a more rigorous and accurate manner, each megawatt of \nfirm capacity (UCAP) is worth more. Therefore, PJM will need to procure less firm capacity to \nmeet reliability requirements. For example, the reliability requirement for the 2025/2026 capacity \nauction decreased by 8 percent for the BGE LDA relative to the 2024/2025 delivery year.48 \n\nImportantly, reducing the reliability requirement shifts the VRR curve to the left (down in \nquantity), as the VRR curve of each LDA is based on its reliability requirement. The VRR price \npoints also increase, as Net CONE will be tied to the ELCC of the reference resource, rather \nthan a pool-wide average forced outage rate. 49 Specifically, Net CONE is converted to $/MW-\nday (UCAP) using the ELCC class rating of the Reference Resource, rather than using the pool-\nwide average effective forced outage rate (EFORd). This conversion results in a higher Net \nCONE.50 The higher Net CONE is important because the maximum capacity market clearing \nprice under PJM rules is 1.5 times the Net CONE value.  These changes to the VRR curve were \nimplemented in the 2025/2026 capacity auction.51\n# 【13†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n46 PJM Market Implementation Committee.

The supply of capacity of any given LDA is made up of three \nresource types: (1) generation capacity, (2) demand response, and if constrained, then (3) \ncapacity imports.52 When there are reductions in supply (for example, if a plant retires in a highly \nconstrained zone), the supply curve shifts left. This moves the intercept point with the VRR \ncurve upwards and pushes the capacity price higher. If there is not enough supply (generating \ncapacity, demand response, and imported capacity) for the supply curve to intercept the \ndemand curve, then the capacity price for that LDA will be set at the maximum, 1.5 times Net \nCONE. In other words, to avoid maximum price, the supply curve has to intercept the demand \ncurve to the right and downward of Point A (the maximum price point on the VRR curve), as \ndisplayed in Figure 1 (above).\n# 【14†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n40 PJM Interconnection. 2024/2025 RPM Base Residual Auction Planning Period Parameters.

When an LDA is import-constrained, it can experience price separation from its parent \nLDA(s). Within the nested structure of the market, a clearing price in a child LDA is never lower \nthan its parent LDA’s clearing price.41 If a child LDA does not have sufficient local capacity to \nmeet its local peak, and transmission constraints prevent the LDA from importing enough \ncapacity to make up the difference, a higher-cost resource might set the price for the child LDA \nat a higher clearing price than its parent LDA. In other words, instead of the child LDA clearing \nwith its parent LDA at the parent LDA clearing price, it clears at a higher price. This has \noccurred in recent years in BGE LDA, relative to its parent LDA, SWMAAC. BGE LDA \nseparated and experienced a higher price than its parent LDA over the last six auctions. On the \nother hand, the Pepco LDA, which is also part of SWMAAC, did not experience price \nseparation. SWMAAC LDA itself cleared with its own parent, MAAC LDA, or the RTO as a \nwhole (Figure 4).  \n\n \n41 Newell A., Oates, D., Pfeifenberger, J., Spees, K., Hagerty, J.M., Pedtke, J., Witkin, M., Shorin, E.

The next PJM capacity market auction, for the 2026/2027 delivery year, is set \nto occur in December 2024, less than 5 months from the recently completed 2025/2026 auction, \nmaking it unlikely that there will be any major increases in available supply. Given the long wait \ntimes in processing the interconnection queue (delaying the interconnection of new generating \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  10 \n\nresources to the grid to replace the RMR units) and the uncertainty around queue reform, it is \nunlikely that enough new generation will be under way before December 2024 and online by \nJune 1, 2026 (the start of the 2026/2027 delivery year) to substantially alleviate the very high \nprices seen for the 2025/2026 BRA. In the case of the BGE LDA, these interconnection queue \nbacklogs make it unlikely that any major generation will be interconnected before the end of \n2028, the earliest date for ending the Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s RMR arrangements. Thus, \nthe strong price signal sent by the high capacity market prices in the BGE LDA (and the RTO as \na whole) may not induce timely new generation into service within the LDA before the \ncompletion of the transmission lines that end the need for these RMRs (or to help alleviate \nprices seen across the region). Instead, the clogged queue could lock in a windfall for the \nexisting generating units continuing to operate in the BGE LDA and across the PJM region \ngenerally.\n# 【17†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n5.

Auctions are \nusually held three years in advance of the delivery year. Due to recent \nchanges in market design, among other factors, PJM held the most recent  \nBRA, in July, 2024, for the delivery year starting June 1, 2025 (the BRA \n25/26), with the auction held only about one year in advance of the \nbeginning of the delivery year. PJM currently intends to conduct \nsubsequent BRAs on an accelerated basis to enable returning to the 3-\nyear forward schedule. The BRA is the first auction, in a cycle of several \nauctions for each delivery year underPJM’s Reliability Pricing Model \n(RPM), or capacity market, where the majority of the RPM capacity is \nprocured for a particular delivery year. \n\nCETL Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer Limit \n\nCapacity Emergency Transfer Limit (CETL) is the capability of the \ntransmission system to support deliveries of electric energy to a given \narea (or LDA, see below) experiencing a localized capacity emergency as \ndetermined in accordance with the PJM Manuals. \n\nCETO Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer \nObjective \n\nThe amount of electric energy that a given area (a LDA) must be able to \nimport in order to remain within a loss of load expectation of one event in \n25 years (or its expected unserved energy (EUE) equivalent under the \nnew PJM reliability metrics starting with the 25/26 BRA) when the area is \nexperiencing a localized capacity emergency. \n\nCONE Cost of New \nEntry \n\nCONE represents the total annual net revenue (net of variable operating \ncosts) that a new generation resource would need to recover its capital \ninvestment and fixed costs, given reasonable expectations about future cost \nrecovery over its economic life. CONE is the starting point for estimating the \nNet Cost of New Entry (Net CONE). Net CONE represents the first-year \nrevenues that a new resource would need to earn in the capacity market, \nafter netting out energy and ancillary service (E&AS) margins from CONE. \nThis metric is used in calculating the VRR Curve (see below) which is used \nto define the administrative cost cap to the BRA. \n\nCSRR Cost of Service \nRecovery Rate \n\nOne of two options RMR (see below) owners can elect for cost recovery \nfor an RMR agreement.

CTRs essentially represent the value of the transmission \nsystem’s ability to “transfer” capacity resources to the LDA zone and offset “capacity \ncongestion” effects. These are rights for load (i.e. customers) to receive payments that offset, in \nwhole or in part, the charges attributable to the locational price adder. The locational price adder \nis the component of the clearing price that represents the price-separated clearing price relative \nto its parent LDA clearing price. The CTRs are payments equal to the locational price adder \ntimes the load’s pro rata share of the lower-priced capacity imported into the LDA. 62 CTRs \nserve to offset a portion of the higher capacity prices for customers in that constrained LDA. We \nused the CTR allocation and annual capacity market costs for customers provided in PJM’s \n2025/2026 Base Residual Auction Results (Excel workbook).63  \n\nTiming of Bill and Rate Impacts \n\nThe rate and bill impacts will be felt starting in mid-2025 and beyond, and different customers \ncould feel the impacts at different times. For retail customers taking standard offer service, \nelectric utilities procure energy and capacity from wholesale suppliers through a competitive \nbidding process that occurs twice a year.64 These wholesale suppliers are the entities that \ndirectly pay for increased capacity costs; their bid price in the competitive bidding process \nreflects capacity market costs. The winning wholesale supplier of that bidding process then \nsupplies electricity to the utilities at an agreed-upon rate, for six months, who then pass on \nthose costs to their customers. Standard offer service power procurement uses a proxy price for \ncapacity costs because of the delays in running PJM capacity auctions. The proxy price will be \nadjusted based on the actual capacity market results. This adjustment will raise the wholesale \nsupply contract prices for service starting June 1, 2025, and standard offer service customers \nwill see the impact in the bills starting on that date. Electric customers may choose to procure \ntheir own electricity supply from alternative electricity suppliers, who also work with wholesale \n\n \n61 This analysis does not account for the transmission solutions approved for Maryland and the surrounding areas, in \nresponse to Brandon Shore’s planned retirement. \n62 Allocation of CTR MWs to LSEs, April 7, 2021.

RMR Costs and Capacity Market Impacts for Customers in BGE LDA\n# 【19†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nThese bill impacts represent the incremental change from the 2024/2025 to 2025/2026 delivery \nyears. APS LDA generally clears with the RTO, meaning that in the previous auction the \nclearing price was $29/MW-day, while Pepco LDA cleared with MAAC at $49/MW-day. In the \n2024/2025 BRA, DPL-South LDA separated at $426/MW-day,67 but cleared with the RTO in the \n2025/2026 BRA at $270/MW-day. The fact that the APS LDA historically has cleared at the \nlowest price—and has benefitted from the lowest past capacity prices—helps explain why the \nAPS LDA has the largest bill impact relative to the other Maryland LDAs, including BGE’s LDA. \nIn addition, CTRs are used to help mitigate the customer impact of higher-priced capacity in \nconstrained LDAs (e.g. BGE’s), which also helps to explain why the BGE bill impact is not \nmagnitudes higher than that of the APS and Pepco LDAs, despite the extreme capacity clearing \nprice in the BGE LDA. CTRs also insulated electric customers from the high clearing prices in \nDPL-South LDA in 2024/2025, which results in only a small bill increase for DPL-South LDA \ncustomers between 2024/2025 and 2025/2026.  \n\nWe also assessed the bill impact of the RMR costs for the Maryland portion of the Pepco, DPL-\nSouth, and APS LDAs, using the same methods described above. We find that residential \nelectric customers in the Maryland portion of the Pepco LDA will experience a small increase \n(roughly $1 per month) in their bills from Brandon Shores and Wagner RMR costs, starting in \nJune 2025 (Table 8). The Maryland portion of the APS and DPL-South LDAs will pay for 0.1 and \n1 percent of the Brandon Shores and Wagner RMR costs, respectively, and thus residential \ncustomers will not see any noticeable impact on their bills as a result of these RMRs (Table 8). \n\n \n67 DPL-South 2024/2025 clearing price was originally $90.64/MW-day. It was repriced due to a Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals reversal of PJM's determination of the original price. The updated $426.17/MW-day clearing price for DPL-\nSouth is now approved by FERC, but still the subject of litigation.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  31 \n\nTable 8.

Over the course of a \nyear, that could result in residential electric customers paying an additional $247 annually, and \ncommercial customers paying $2,685 of additional costs. Customers will likely feel these costs \nimpacts until at least December 2028, when PJM has planned for the transmission solutions to \nbe in place (but the timeline for transmission solution completion is highly uncertain). Once the \ntransmission projects are complete (assuming no other reliability issues), the RMRs will no \nlonger be needed for reliability, and the BGE LDA will be able to mitigate high capacity prices by \nimporting lower-priced capacity from neighboring LDAs. In addition, before 2028, additional \ndemand response or generating resources may offer into the market, partially mitigating \ncapacity price increases in the BGE LDA. However, given that the next auction (for 2026/2027) \nis less than five months from the latest auction (2025/2026) and the beginning of that auction’s \ndelivery year is only 1 ½ years following its completion, it is unlikely that there will be any \nchange to BGE LDA capacity price until at least 2027/2028.  \n\n \n65 Industrial customers are excluded from this analysis, due to the wide variation in energy use and monthly bills. \n66 Capacity costs are only a small portion of a customer’s electric bill.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  30 \n\nTable 7.

Specifically, \nin 2023, Talen Energy, the owner of the aging, large, fossil fuel-fired power plants—Brandon \nShores Units 1 & 2 and Wagner Units 3 & 4—announced its intent to retire (or deactivate) the \nplants, effective June 1, 2025. The units are in the BGE LDA, an area already known for its \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  8 \n\nconstrained transmission capacity. PJM determined their retirement could cause grid reliability \nissues until new transmission solutions can be implemented to bring in electricity from other \nareas and to address power quality issues arising when the power plants are retired.  \n\nWhile the transmission solutions are being built (that address the reliability issues arising from \nTalen plant retirements), PJM is arranging for the continued operation of these four units past \ntheir proposed retirement date of June 2025. The plants would operate under a “reliability must \nrun,” or “RMR” arrangement and receive payments—funded through customer rates—outside of \nthe competitive wholesale power markets. RMR service is intended to ensure grid reliability until \nthe transmission grid can be enhanced to eliminate the grid reliability concerns associated with \nthe plant retirements.  \n\nUnder these RMR arrangements, ratepayers will pay the power plants’ owner compensation for \nthe continued operation of the plants under a separate “out of market” regime administered by \nPJM. Importantly, these RMR units do not participate in the capacity market as supply-side \nresources, dramatically reducing supply in the already-constrained BGE LDA. In fact, without \nthese units participating in the capacity market in 2025/2026, less than 10 percent of BGE’s \ncleared capacity was from generation within the BGE LDA, pushing the clearing price for the \nBGE LDA to the capacity price maximum for the LDA.\n# 【3†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  7 \n\n• Delmarva Power South (DPL-South LDA), which covers Maryland and Delaware \nportions of the Delmarva Peninsula, including Maryland utility Delmarva Power; and \n\n• Potomac Electric Power (Pepco LDA), which covers portions of Maryland and \nWashington, D.C., including Maryland utilities Potomac Electric Power (Pepco) and \nSouthern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO). \n\n \n\nExcept for the BGE LDA, the Maryland LDAs cover multiple jurisdictions and encompass other \nutilities within them. For example, the Pepco LDA includes SMECO, which means that the \ncustomer impacts discussed in this report for the Pepco LDA apply equally to SMECO \ncustomers. Similarly, the impacts on DPL-South LDA apply to customers of Delmarva Power & \nLight as well as municipal and cooperative electric utilities on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. \n\nOver the past several years, the BGE LDA has been capacity-constrained and has seen higher \nprices relative to other LDAs. Once again, in the latest base residual auction, for the 2025/2026 \ndelivery year, the BGE LDA was capacity-constrained, and this time it cleared at its maximum \npossible price: $466/MW-day. This is a six-fold increase from the 2024/2025 BGE LDA BRA \nclearing price of $73/MW-day. The APS, DPL-South, and Pepco LDAs all cleared at the same \nclearing price as the full RTO, which saw prices of $270/MW-day, a nine-fold increase from the \nprevious year’s results ($29/MW-day). Electric customers pay for capacity at these prices, \nmeaning that the results of this auction will be seen on the bills of electric customers in \nMaryland starting in 2025 or beyond. In the BGE LDA, the total increase in customer costs from \nthe 2024/2025 to the 2025/2026 BRA auction is $504 million. For the average residential \ncustomer in the BGE LDA, this means an additional $16 per month on their electric bills for at \nleast a year (Table 1). Similarly, average residential customers in APS, DPL-South, and Pepco \nLDAs will see an additional $18, $4, and $14 per month, respectively, on their electric bills \nstarting in 2025 or soon after (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1.

APS LDA generally clears with the RTO, meaning that in the previous auction the \nclearing price was $29/MW-day, while Pepco LDA cleared with MAAC at $49/MW-day. In the \n2024/2025 BRA, DPL-South LDA separated at $426/MW-day,67 but cleared with the RTO in the \n2025/2026 BRA at $270/MW-day. The fact that the APS LDA historically has cleared at the \nlowest price—and has benefitted from the lowest past capacity prices—helps explain why the \nAPS LDA has the largest bill impact relative to the other Maryland LDAs, including BGE’s LDA. \nIn addition, CTRs are used to help mitigate the customer impact of higher-priced capacity in \nconstrained LDAs (e.g. BGE’s), which also helps to explain why the BGE bill impact is not \nmagnitudes higher than that of the APS and Pepco LDAs, despite the extreme capacity clearing \nprice in the BGE LDA. CTRs also insulated electric customers from the high clearing prices in \nDPL-South LDA in 2024/2025, which results in only a small bill increase for DPL-South LDA \ncustomers between 2024/2025 and 2025/2026.  \n\nWe also assessed the bill impact of the RMR costs for the Maryland portion of the Pepco, DPL-\nSouth, and APS LDAs, using the same methods described above. We find that residential \nelectric customers in the Maryland portion of the Pepco LDA will experience a small increase \n(roughly $1 per month) in their bills from Brandon Shores and Wagner RMR costs, starting in \nJune 2025 (Table 8). The Maryland portion of the APS and DPL-South LDAs will pay for 0.1 and \n1 percent of the Brandon Shores and Wagner RMR costs, respectively, and thus residential \ncustomers will not see any noticeable impact on their bills as a result of these RMRs (Table 8). \n\n \n67 DPL-South 2024/2025 clearing price was originally $90.64/MW-day.

LOOKING FORWARD BEYOND THE 2025/2026 DELIVERY YEAR \n\nFor the BGE LDA, PJM suggests that the reliability issues and transmission constraints \nassociated with Brandon Shores and Wagner will be mitigated by the end of 2028 once \ntransmission solutions are in place. That outcome is by no means a certainty. Project delays \nrelated to these factors may very well mean the BGE LDA could face reliability constraints after \n2028, thus incurring even more costs for customers. In addition, PJM has been struggling with a \nmassive backlog of new project interconnections, while at the same time working towards \ncompliance with new and anticipated FERC reforms. These factors complicate the development \nof new generation within the BGE LDA and throughout PJM, which would help alleviate the very \nhigh capacity prices seen in the latest auction for the BGE LDA and across the RTO. \nUnfortunately, we are unlikely to see any major relief by 2026/2027, as that delivery year’s \ncapacity auction is scheduled for December 2024, less than five months after the completion of \nthe July 2024 auction for 2025/2026 and only 1 ½ years before the beginning of the delivery \nyear for that auction (leaving a very tight timeline for constructing a new plant).  \n\nAccording to PJM, if there are no delays, it will take a customer in the interconnection queue \nabout 10 months from queue entry for an impact study to be tendered. The full timeline from \nqueue entry to final agreement is between 2.25 and 2.54 years as reported by PJM.68 However, \nthat timeline has not been accurate for at least the past few years.  \n\n \n68 PJM Learning Center, “Connecting to the Grid FAQs.” Available at: https://learn.pjm.com/three-priorities/planning-\nfor-the-future/connecting-grid/how-long-does-the-interconnection-process-take  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  32\n# 【7†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n61 This analysis does not account for the transmission solutions approved for Maryland and the surrounding areas, in \nresponse to Brandon Shore’s planned retirement. \n62 Allocation of CTR MWs to LSEs, April 7, 2021.

RMR Costs and Capacity Market Impacts for Customers in BGE LDA \n\nTalen Energy filed initial fixed RMR costs for Brandon Shores and Wagner that together total \n$215.7 million per year. Although these RMR arrangement costs are expected to be litigated at \nFERC, we expect that BGE LDA customers will bear 74 percent of these RMR costs. As a \nresult, BGE LDA customers could see their bills increase by 5 percent, resulting in an average \nresidential bill increase of $5 per month. Commercial customers65 could see their bills increase \nby $54 per month (Table 7). These RMR costs are expected to last until at least December \n2028, when PJM currently plans to have the transmission solutions in place. The RMR \narrangements could be extended if these transmission projects are delayed or if the region \ncontinues to face reliability issues beyond 2028, which would mean continued rate and bill \nimpacts for BGE LDA electric customers. \n\nSecond, Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s removal from the capacity market has significantly \nimpacted the BGE LDA clearing price. Those impacts will, in turn, be passed on to electric \ncustomers in that zone. Specifically, we expect the capacity price spike to increase bills by 14 \npercent In the BGE LDA66—in addition to the 5 percent from RMR arrangement costs (Table 7). \nFrom the capacity price increase alone, average residential and commercial customers could \nsee their bills increase by $16 per month and $170 per month, respectively (excluding RMR \ncosts).\n# 【8†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nAffordability Baseline\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBill and Rate Impacts of \nPJM’s 2025/2026 \nCapacity Market Results \n& Reliability Must-Run \nUnits in Maryland \n       \n\n \n\n         August 2024 \n\n(corrected 8/29/24) \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  2 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS   \n\nGlossary................................................................................................................................ 3 \n\n1.

Auctions are \nusually held three years in advance of the delivery year. Due to recent \nchanges in market design, among other factors, PJM held the most recent  \nBRA, in July, 2024, for the delivery year starting June 1, 2025 (the BRA \n25/26), with the auction held only about one year in advance of the \nbeginning of the delivery year. PJM currently intends to conduct \nsubsequent BRAs on an accelerated basis to enable returning to the 3-\nyear forward schedule. The BRA is the first auction, in a cycle of several \nauctions for each delivery year underPJM’s Reliability Pricing Model \n(RPM), or capacity market, where the majority of the RPM capacity is \nprocured for a particular delivery year. \n\nCETL Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer Limit\n# 【9†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nImportantly, reducing the reliability requirement shifts the VRR curve to the left (down in \nquantity), as the VRR curve of each LDA is based on its reliability requirement. The VRR price \npoints also increase, as Net CONE will be tied to the ELCC of the reference resource, rather \nthan a pool-wide average forced outage rate. 49 Specifically, Net CONE is converted to $/MW-\nday (UCAP) using the ELCC class rating of the Reference Resource, rather than using the pool-\nwide average effective forced outage rate (EFORd). This conversion results in a higher Net \nCONE.50 The higher Net CONE is important because the maximum capacity market clearing \nprice under PJM rules is 1.5 times the Net CONE value.  These changes to the VRR curve were \nimplemented in the 2025/2026 capacity auction.51 \n\nFinally, PJM has changed how it models reliability import requirements. PJM will adopt hourly \nprobabilistic modeling to model the Capacity Emergency Transfer Objective (CETO). CETO is \nthe required transfer amount to satisfy an LDA’s reliability requirements. This change could \nimpact which LDAs are considered constrained and must be modeled separately from the rest \nof the RTO.  \n\n \n46 PJM Market Implementation Committee. January 10, 2024.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nPJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), the entity that operates the electricity grid for the Mid-Atlantic \nregion and nearby states, administers a capacity market to assure adequate generation \ncapacity to meet peak loads and reliability standards.1 As part of its responsibilities, PJM \nprocures capacity through annual competitive auctions. On July 30, 2024, PJM released results \nfor its latest capacity market base residual auction (BRA) for the 2025/2026 delivery year that \nruns from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026. The results showed a more than 800 percent increase \nin system-wide prices relative to the prior BRA for the 2024/2025 delivery year, a price spike \nunprecedented in PJM. Across the entire PJM footprint, beginning June 1, 2025, these capacity \nprices will result in a total annual cost to electric customers of $14.7 billion, a substantial \nincrease from the $2.2 billion in capacity costs in the 2024/2025 delivery year. These surging \nprices are driven primarily by (1) increases in load, (2) various market rule changes that, among \nother effects, modify how supply (e.g., generation) is valued in the capacity market, and (3) a \nreduction in capacity market supply due to plant retirements and retirement-related “reliability-\nmust-run” (RMR) arrangements.  The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel commissioned \nSynapse Energy Economics (Synapse) to analyze the likely impacts of the changes in the \ncapacity market and these RMR arrangements on the rates paid by Maryland’s electric utility \ncustomers. \n\nThe capacity market auction is conducted for the entire PJM footprint. Capacity-constrained \nregions, known as locational deliverability areas (LDAs) can sometimes have separate, higher \ncapacity prices from the RTO as a whole. These LDAs exhibit constraints when comparing the \nlocal load within the LDA, the local generation within the LDA, and the PJM-administered \ntransmission system’s ability to transfer power into the LDA. The different, typically higher \nclearing prices for the constrained LDAs reflect the tighter balance of load, local generation, and \ntransmission transfer capacity into the LDA when compared with broader areas of the PJM \nfootprint. \n\nMaryland is included in all or portions of four LDAs:  \n\n• Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE LDA), the only LDA entirely located in Maryland, which \nis comprised of Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BGE) Maryland service territory; \n\n• Allegheny Power System (APS LDA), which covers portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, including the service territory of Potomac Edison, which \nserves customers in Western Maryland, and various municipal utilities in the APS LDA \nfootprint;\n# 【12†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  29 \n\nsuppliers to procure energy and capacity. The impact of higher capacity prices on those \ncustomers will depend on the terms of the retail supply contract. \n\n4.2. RMR Costs and Capacity Market Impacts for Customers in BGE LDA \n\nTalen Energy filed initial fixed RMR costs for Brandon Shores and Wagner that together total \n$215.7 million per year. Although these RMR arrangement costs are expected to be litigated at \nFERC, we expect that BGE LDA customers will bear 74 percent of these RMR costs. As a \nresult, BGE LDA customers could see their bills increase by 5 percent, resulting in an average \nresidential bill increase of $5 per month. Commercial customers65 could see their bills increase \nby $54 per month (Table 7). These RMR costs are expected to last until at least December \n2028, when PJM currently plans to have the transmission solutions in place. The RMR \narrangements could be extended if these transmission projects are delayed or if the region \ncontinues to face reliability issues beyond 2028, which would mean continued rate and bill \nimpacts for BGE LDA electric customers. \n\nSecond, Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s removal from the capacity market has significantly \nimpacted the BGE LDA clearing price. Those impacts will, in turn, be passed on to electric \ncustomers in that zone. Specifically, we expect the capacity price spike to increase bills by 14 \npercent In the BGE LDA66—in addition to the 5 percent from RMR arrangement costs (Table 7). \nFrom the capacity price increase alone, average residential and commercial customers could \nsee their bills increase by $16 per month and $170 per month, respectively (excluding RMR \ncosts).  \n\nWhen considering both the capacity market impact and the RMR service arrangement costs \ntogether, total bills are likely to increase by 19 percent—an extra $21 on the average residential \ncustomer bill and $224 on the average commercial monthly bill (Table 7). Over the course of a \nyear, that could result in residential electric customers paying an additional $247 annually, and \ncommercial customers paying $2,685 of additional costs. Customers will likely feel these costs \nimpacts until at least December 2028, when PJM has planned for the transmission solutions to \nbe in place (but the timeline for transmission solution completion is highly uncertain). Once the \ntransmission projects are complete (assuming no other reliability issues), the RMRs will no \nlonger be needed for reliability, and the BGE LDA will be able to mitigate high capacity prices by \nimporting lower-priced capacity from neighboring LDAs. In addition, before 2028, additional \ndemand response or generating resources may offer into the market, partially mitigating \ncapacity price increases in the BGE LDA. However, given that the next auction (for 2026/2027) \nis less than five months from the latest auction (2025/2026) and the beginning of that auction’s \ndelivery year is only 1 ½ years following its completion, it is unlikely that there will be any \nchange to BGE LDA capacity price until at least 2027/2028.  \n\n \n65 Industrial customers are excluded from this analysis, due to the wide variation in energy use and monthly bills. \n66 Capacity costs are only a small portion of a customer’s electric bill.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  30 \n\nTable 7.

Capacity-constrained \nregions, known as locational deliverability areas (LDAs) can sometimes have separate, higher \ncapacity prices from the RTO as a whole. These LDAs exhibit constraints when comparing the \nlocal load within the LDA, the local generation within the LDA, and the PJM-administered \ntransmission system’s ability to transfer power into the LDA. The different, typically higher \nclearing prices for the constrained LDAs reflect the tighter balance of load, local generation, and \ntransmission transfer capacity into the LDA when compared with broader areas of the PJM \nfootprint. \n\nMaryland is included in all or portions of four LDAs:  \n\n• Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE LDA), the only LDA entirely located in Maryland, which \nis comprised of Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BGE) Maryland service territory; \n\n• Allegheny Power System (APS LDA), which covers portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, including the service territory of Potomac Edison, which \nserves customers in Western Maryland, and various municipal utilities in the APS LDA \nfootprint; \n\n \n1 PJM administers other product markets, in addition to the capacity market, that are paid for by electric customers. \nPJM administers the “energy” market for the power consumed by customers continuously over time. It also plans and \nprocures the transmission system within its footprint. In relative terms, the costs of the energy and capacity markets \nand those due to transmission costs are the three principal cost components of wholesale electric costs borne by \nelectric customers. In 2023, they comprised 62%, 8% and 27%, respectively, on average across the PJM footprint of \nwholesale electric costs. With the results of the recent 25/26 BRA discussed further in the report, capacity costs \nbeginning June 1, 2025 will comprise nearly 27% of total wholesale costs (up from 8% in 2023), assuming energy \nand transmission costs remain near 2023 levels.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nPJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), the entity that operates the electricity grid for the Mid-Atlantic \nregion and nearby states, administers a capacity market to assure adequate generation \ncapacity to meet peak loads and reliability standards.1 As part of its responsibilities, PJM \nprocures capacity through annual competitive auctions. On July 30, 2024, PJM released results \nfor its latest capacity market base residual auction (BRA) for the 2025/2026 delivery year that \nruns from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026. The results showed a more than 800 percent increase \nin system-wide prices relative to the prior BRA for the 2024/2025 delivery year, a price spike \nunprecedented in PJM. Across the entire PJM footprint, beginning June 1, 2025, these capacity \nprices will result in a total annual cost to electric customers of $14.7 billion, a substantial \nincrease from the $2.2 billion in capacity costs in the 2024/2025 delivery year. These surging \nprices are driven primarily by (1) increases in load, (2) various market rule changes that, among \nother effects, modify how supply (e.g., generation) is valued in the capacity market, and (3) a \nreduction in capacity market supply due to plant retirements and retirement-related “reliability-\nmust-run” (RMR) arrangements.  The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel commissioned \nSynapse Energy Economics (Synapse) to analyze the likely impacts of the changes in the \ncapacity market and these RMR arrangements on the rates paid by Maryland’s electric utility \ncustomers.\n# 【15†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  17 \n\nstill tied to meeting the one day in ten years (or 25 years) reliability metric. PJM expresses this \nreliability requirement as forecasted peak load plus a reserve margin. PJM conducts annual \nauctions to procure capacity and maintain reliability, starting with the Base Residual Auction \n(BRA) and subsequent incremental auctions. The capacity clearing price is the intercept point \nbetween the demand curve and the supply curve; the clearing price is paid to all cleared \ncapacity resources for that delivery year.  \n\nPJM uses a downward sloping demand curve, called the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) \ncurve, to specify prices and demand relative to the reserve margin requirements. To set the \nVRR curve, PJM conducts its annual Reserve Requirement Study. The study is a probabilistic \nrisk modeling exercise that incorporates load forecasts, generation capabilities and outage \nrates, and other factors to determine the Installed Reserve Margin (IRM) necessary to meet the \nreliability standard (1-in-10 LOLE equivalency). Once approved by the PJM Board, the outputs \nof the study define the Reliability Requirement, which is used to determine the three points that \nmake up the VRR Curve (points A, B, and C)36 (Figure 1, with Pepco LDA as an example). The \nmaximum price on the VRR curve is 1.5 times the net Cost of New Entry (CONE);37 net CONE \nis the estimated price that a new generation resource would need to enter the market, net of \nenergy market revenues.  \n\n \nmix, which increasingly will be composed of resources with greater hourly performance variability, further supports \nthe need to include EUE in resource adequacy risk modeling.”  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, January 30, \n2024. Order Accepting Tariff Revisions Subject to Condition. Docket ER24-98, at 62. \n36 Each point on the VRR curve is defined by the reliability requirement and Net CONE (e.g. point B is set at 101.6% \ntimes the reliability requirement and 0.75 times Net CONE, and point C is set at 106.8% times the reliability \nrequirement at a price of $0), creating a downward sloping curve. These values that define the curve are determined \nby PJM probabilistic modeling of reliability, and means that if capacity is more expensive, slightly less of it will be \nprocured, while if capacity is less expensive, more capacity may be procured. \n37 Or Gross CONE, whichever is greatest. \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  18 \n\nFigure 1.

CTRs essentially represent the value of the transmission \nsystem’s ability to “transfer” capacity resources to the LDA zone and offset “capacity \ncongestion” effects. These are rights for load (i.e. customers) to receive payments that offset, in \nwhole or in part, the charges attributable to the locational price adder. The locational price adder \nis the component of the clearing price that represents the price-separated clearing price relative \nto its parent LDA clearing price. The CTRs are payments equal to the locational price adder \ntimes the load’s pro rata share of the lower-priced capacity imported into the LDA. 62 CTRs \nserve to offset a portion of the higher capacity prices for customers in that constrained LDA. We \nused the CTR allocation and annual capacity market costs for customers provided in PJM’s \n2025/2026 Base Residual Auction Results (Excel workbook).63  \n\nTiming of Bill and Rate Impacts \n\nThe rate and bill impacts will be felt starting in mid-2025 and beyond, and different customers \ncould feel the impacts at different times. For retail customers taking standard offer service, \nelectric utilities procure energy and capacity from wholesale suppliers through a competitive \nbidding process that occurs twice a year.64 These wholesale suppliers are the entities that \ndirectly pay for increased capacity costs; their bid price in the competitive bidding process \nreflects capacity market costs. The winning wholesale supplier of that bidding process then \nsupplies electricity to the utilities at an agreed-upon rate, for six months, who then pass on \nthose costs to their customers. Standard offer service power procurement uses a proxy price for \ncapacity costs because of the delays in running PJM capacity auctions. The proxy price will be \nadjusted based on the actual capacity market results. This adjustment will raise the wholesale \nsupply contract prices for service starting June 1, 2025, and standard offer service customers \nwill see the impact in the bills starting on that date. Electric customers may choose to procure \ntheir own electricity supply from alternative electricity suppliers, who also work with wholesale \n\n \n61 This analysis does not account for the transmission solutions approved for Maryland and the surrounding areas, in \nresponse to Brandon Shore’s planned retirement. \n62 Allocation of CTR MWs to LSEs, April 7, 2021.

When an LDA is import-constrained, it can experience price separation from its parent \nLDA(s). Within the nested structure of the market, a clearing price in a child LDA is never lower \nthan its parent LDA’s clearing price.41 If a child LDA does not have sufficient local capacity to \nmeet its local peak, and transmission constraints prevent the LDA from importing enough \ncapacity to make up the difference, a higher-cost resource might set the price for the child LDA \nat a higher clearing price than its parent LDA. In other words, instead of the child LDA clearing \nwith its parent LDA at the parent LDA clearing price, it clears at a higher price. This has \noccurred in recent years in BGE LDA, relative to its parent LDA, SWMAAC. BGE LDA \nseparated and experienced a higher price than its parent LDA over the last six auctions. On the \nother hand, the Pepco LDA, which is also part of SWMAAC, did not experience price \nseparation. SWMAAC LDA itself cleared with its own parent, MAAC LDA, or the RTO as a \nwhole (Figure 4).  \n\n \n41 Newell A., Oates, D., Pfeifenberger, J., Spees, K., Hagerty, J.M., Pedtke, J., Witkin, M., Shorin, E.

CUSTOMER BILL AND RATE IMPACTS OF RMRS IN \nMARYLAND \n\nAcross the PJM footprint, electric utility customers will see rising costs as a result of the \nincreased capacity clearing prices for the 2025/2026 delivery year. For customers in the BGE \nLDA, the impact of the soaring capacity price is compounded by having to pay for a substantial \nportion of the out-of-market RMR arrangement costs for Brandon Shores and Wagner. This \nsection describes those impacts for electric utility customers in the BGE LDA, as well as the \nimpacts to customers in other LDAs within Maryland. \n\n4.1. Analytical Approach and Assumptions \n\nUsing utility data and billing determinants from the U.S. Energy Information Administration \n(EIA),60 we examined the bill and rate impact associated with RMR costs and recent capacity \n\n \n58 The capacity price in the BGE LDA in 2024/2025 was $73/MW-day, and most if not all of Brandon Shores and \nWagner cleared as capacity resources in that delivery year.  \n59 The $360 million benefit includes Talen’s revenue from the RMR arrangement, where Brandon Shores and Wagner \ncapacity market revenue would be netted out from final RMR costs.  \n60 Billing determinants from U.S. Energy Information Administration form 861. \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  28 \n\nmarket results for all four Maryland LDAs: BGE, Pepco, DPL-South, and APS.61 We focused \nspecifically on Maryland’s share of each LDA, rather than the LDAs as a whole. BGE’s Maryland \nshare is the same as its entire LDA because the BGE LDA is located entirely within Maryland. \nBecause EIA billing determinant data was only available up to 2022, we assumed that energy, \ntransmission, distribution, and other costs have remained unchanged since 2022 and will \ncontinue to be stable through the end of the study period. Capacity market costs for the \n2025/2026 delivery year are compared against capacity market results from 2024/2025.  This \nrate and bill impact analysis does not include the cost of the transmission solutions approved for \nthe BGE LDA and the surrounding areas that aim to address the reliability impact associated \nwith Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s retirement. \n\nCapacity Market Costs Paid by Customers\n# 【19†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nTalen Energy is seeking to recover annual fixed costs of over $215 million for Brandon Shores’ \nand Wagner’s RMR arrangements, combined. These RMRs could cost Maryland’s residents \nand businesses over $629 million through 2028, the earliest by which the RMR arrangements \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  9 \n\ncould end. BGE customers can expect to pay an estimated 74 percent—or roughly $159 million \nper year—of these costs. As a result, BGE customers could see their bills increase by \napproximately 5 percent, resulting in an average residential bill increase of $5 per month due to \nRMR costs alone (Table 2). When combined with the incremental impact of the capacity market \ncosts (Table 1, above), electric customers in the BGE LDA could see average bill increases of \n$21 per month.  \n\nTable 2.

For one, OPC is litigating the amount of recoverable \nRMR costs before FERC. Second, there is uncertainty in the length of time that PJM will use \nthese units for RMR service. PJM has indicated that it requires Brandon Shores to provide RMR \nservice until December 2028, when it projects that the transmission solutions needed to \neliminate the need for the Brandon Shores RMR units will be completed, while the Wagner plant \nmay need to continue providing RMR service beyond 2028. However, if there are major \nchanges to load or other factors that could affect reliability in the region, PJM may determine \nthat Brandon Shores and Wagner need to continue providing reliability service beyond the \ncurrently planned December 2028 date. Lastly, the projected completion date of December \n2028 for these transmission solutions is highly uncertain; there could be delays in the project \nconstruction and execution, further imposing RMR costs on electric customers. If the \ntransmission projects are not complete by the end of 2028, and/or the continued operation of \nthe RMR units are required beyond December of that year, the RMR costs for electric \ncustomers would necessarily increase.\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

RMR Costs and Capacity Market Impacts for Customers in BGE LDA \n\nTalen Energy filed initial fixed RMR costs for Brandon Shores and Wagner that together total \n$215.7 million per year. Although these RMR arrangement costs are expected to be litigated at \nFERC, we expect that BGE LDA customers will bear 74 percent of these RMR costs. As a \nresult, BGE LDA customers could see their bills increase by 5 percent, resulting in an average \nresidential bill increase of $5 per month. Commercial customers65 could see their bills increase \nby $54 per month (Table 7). These RMR costs are expected to last until at least December \n2028, when PJM currently plans to have the transmission solutions in place. The RMR \narrangements could be extended if these transmission projects are delayed or if the region \ncontinues to face reliability issues beyond 2028, which would mean continued rate and bill \nimpacts for BGE LDA electric customers. \n\nSecond, Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s removal from the capacity market has significantly \nimpacted the BGE LDA clearing price. Those impacts will, in turn, be passed on to electric \ncustomers in that zone. Specifically, we expect the capacity price spike to increase bills by 14 \npercent In the BGE LDA66—in addition to the 5 percent from RMR arrangement costs (Table 7). \nFrom the capacity price increase alone, average residential and commercial customers could \nsee their bills increase by $16 per month and $170 per month, respectively (excluding RMR \ncosts).\n# 【2†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  6 \n\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nPJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), the entity that operates the electricity grid for the Mid-Atlantic \nregion and nearby states, administers a capacity market to assure adequate generation \ncapacity to meet peak loads and reliability standards.1 As part of its responsibilities, PJM \nprocures capacity through annual competitive auctions. On July 30, 2024, PJM released results \nfor its latest capacity market base residual auction (BRA) for the 2025/2026 delivery year that \nruns from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026. The results showed a more than 800 percent increase \nin system-wide prices relative to the prior BRA for the 2024/2025 delivery year, a price spike \nunprecedented in PJM. Across the entire PJM footprint, beginning June 1, 2025, these capacity \nprices will result in a total annual cost to electric customers of $14.7 billion, a substantial \nincrease from the $2.2 billion in capacity costs in the 2024/2025 delivery year. These surging \nprices are driven primarily by (1) increases in load, (2) various market rule changes that, among \nother effects, modify how supply (e.g., generation) is valued in the capacity market, and (3) a \nreduction in capacity market supply due to plant retirements and retirement-related “reliability-\nmust-run” (RMR) arrangements.  The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel commissioned \nSynapse Energy Economics (Synapse) to analyze the likely impacts of the changes in the \ncapacity market and these RMR arrangements on the rates paid by Maryland’s electric utility \ncustomers. \n\nThe capacity market auction is conducted for the entire PJM footprint. Capacity-constrained \nregions, known as locational deliverability areas (LDAs) can sometimes have separate, higher \ncapacity prices from the RTO as a whole. These LDAs exhibit constraints when comparing the \nlocal load within the LDA, the local generation within the LDA, and the PJM-administered \ntransmission system’s ability to transfer power into the LDA. The different, typically higher \nclearing prices for the constrained LDAs reflect the tighter balance of load, local generation, and \ntransmission transfer capacity into the LDA when compared with broader areas of the PJM \nfootprint. \n\nMaryland is included in all or portions of four LDAs:  \n\n• Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE LDA), the only LDA entirely located in Maryland, which \nis comprised of Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BGE) Maryland service territory; \n\n• Allegheny Power System (APS LDA), which covers portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, including the service territory of Potomac Edison, which \nserves customers in Western Maryland, and various municipal utilities in the APS LDA \nfootprint;\n# 【3†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nCapacity Market Costs Paid by Customers \n\nWhen an LDA is constrained, such as the BGE LDA, Capacity Transfer Rights (CTRs) are \nallocated to loads within that LDA. CTRs essentially represent the value of the transmission \nsystem’s ability to “transfer” capacity resources to the LDA zone and offset “capacity \ncongestion” effects. These are rights for load (i.e. customers) to receive payments that offset, in \nwhole or in part, the charges attributable to the locational price adder. The locational price adder \nis the component of the clearing price that represents the price-separated clearing price relative \nto its parent LDA clearing price. The CTRs are payments equal to the locational price adder \ntimes the load’s pro rata share of the lower-priced capacity imported into the LDA. 62 CTRs \nserve to offset a portion of the higher capacity prices for customers in that constrained LDA. We \nused the CTR allocation and annual capacity market costs for customers provided in PJM’s \n2025/2026 Base Residual Auction Results (Excel workbook).63  \n\nTiming of Bill and Rate Impacts \n\nThe rate and bill impacts will be felt starting in mid-2025 and beyond, and different customers \ncould feel the impacts at different times. For retail customers taking standard offer service, \nelectric utilities procure energy and capacity from wholesale suppliers through a competitive \nbidding process that occurs twice a year.64 These wholesale suppliers are the entities that \ndirectly pay for increased capacity costs; their bid price in the competitive bidding process \nreflects capacity market costs. The winning wholesale supplier of that bidding process then \nsupplies electricity to the utilities at an agreed-upon rate, for six months, who then pass on \nthose costs to their customers. Standard offer service power procurement uses a proxy price for \ncapacity costs because of the delays in running PJM capacity auctions. The proxy price will be \nadjusted based on the actual capacity market results. This adjustment will raise the wholesale \nsupply contract prices for service starting June 1, 2025, and standard offer service customers \nwill see the impact in the bills starting on that date. Electric customers may choose to procure \ntheir own electricity supply from alternative electricity suppliers, who also work with wholesale \n\n \n61 This analysis does not account for the transmission solutions approved for Maryland and the surrounding areas, in \nresponse to Brandon Shore’s planned retirement. \n62 Allocation of CTR MWs to LSEs, April 7, 2021.

The VRR price \npoints also increase, as Net CONE will be tied to the ELCC of the reference resource, rather \nthan a pool-wide average forced outage rate. 49 Specifically, Net CONE is converted to $/MW-\nday (UCAP) using the ELCC class rating of the Reference Resource, rather than using the pool-\nwide average effective forced outage rate (EFORd). This conversion results in a higher Net \nCONE.50 The higher Net CONE is important because the maximum capacity market clearing \nprice under PJM rules is 1.5 times the Net CONE value.  These changes to the VRR curve were \nimplemented in the 2025/2026 capacity auction.51 \n\nFinally, PJM has changed how it models reliability import requirements.

When an LDA is import-constrained, it can experience price separation from its parent \nLDA(s). Within the nested structure of the market, a clearing price in a child LDA is never lower \nthan its parent LDA’s clearing price.41 If a child LDA does not have sufficient local capacity to \nmeet its local peak, and transmission constraints prevent the LDA from importing enough \ncapacity to make up the difference, a higher-cost resource might set the price for the child LDA \nat a higher clearing price than its parent LDA. In other words, instead of the child LDA clearing \nwith its parent LDA at the parent LDA clearing price, it clears at a higher price. This has \noccurred in recent years in BGE LDA, relative to its parent LDA, SWMAAC. BGE LDA \nseparated and experienced a higher price than its parent LDA over the last six auctions. On the \nother hand, the Pepco LDA, which is also part of SWMAAC, did not experience price \nseparation. SWMAAC LDA itself cleared with its own parent, MAAC LDA, or the RTO as a \nwhole (Figure 4).  \n\n \n41 Newell A., Oates, D., Pfeifenberger, J., Spees, K., Hagerty, J.M., Pedtke, J., Witkin, M., Shorin, E.

Auctions are \nusually held three years in advance of the delivery year. Due to recent \nchanges in market design, among other factors, PJM held the most recent  \nBRA, in July, 2024, for the delivery year starting June 1, 2025 (the BRA \n25/26), with the auction held only about one year in advance of the \nbeginning of the delivery year. PJM currently intends to conduct \nsubsequent BRAs on an accelerated basis to enable returning to the 3-\nyear forward schedule. The BRA is the first auction, in a cycle of several \nauctions for each delivery year underPJM’s Reliability Pricing Model \n(RPM), or capacity market, where the majority of the RPM capacity is \nprocured for a particular delivery year. \n\nCETL Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer Limit\n# 【8†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  29 \n\nsuppliers to procure energy and capacity. The impact of higher capacity prices on those \ncustomers will depend on the terms of the retail supply contract. \n\n4.2. RMR Costs and Capacity Market Impacts for Customers in BGE LDA \n\nTalen Energy filed initial fixed RMR costs for Brandon Shores and Wagner that together total \n$215.7 million per year. Although these RMR arrangement costs are expected to be litigated at \nFERC, we expect that BGE LDA customers will bear 74 percent of these RMR costs. As a \nresult, BGE LDA customers could see their bills increase by 5 percent, resulting in an average \nresidential bill increase of $5 per month. Commercial customers65 could see their bills increase \nby $54 per month (Table 7). These RMR costs are expected to last until at least December \n2028, when PJM currently plans to have the transmission solutions in place. The RMR \narrangements could be extended if these transmission projects are delayed or if the region \ncontinues to face reliability issues beyond 2028, which would mean continued rate and bill \nimpacts for BGE LDA electric customers. \n\nSecond, Brandon Shores’ and Wagner’s removal from the capacity market has significantly \nimpacted the BGE LDA clearing price. Those impacts will, in turn, be passed on to electric \ncustomers in that zone. Specifically, we expect the capacity price spike to increase bills by 14 \npercent In the BGE LDA66—in addition to the 5 percent from RMR arrangement costs (Table 7). \nFrom the capacity price increase alone, average residential and commercial customers could \nsee their bills increase by $16 per month and $170 per month, respectively (excluding RMR \ncosts).  \n\nWhen considering both the capacity market impact and the RMR service arrangement costs \ntogether, total bills are likely to increase by 19 percent—an extra $21 on the average residential \ncustomer bill and $224 on the average commercial monthly bill (Table 7). Over the course of a \nyear, that could result in residential electric customers paying an additional $247 annually, and \ncommercial customers paying $2,685 of additional costs. Customers will likely feel these costs \nimpacts until at least December 2028, when PJM has planned for the transmission solutions to \nbe in place (but the timeline for transmission solution completion is highly uncertain). Once the \ntransmission projects are complete (assuming no other reliability issues), the RMRs will no \nlonger be needed for reliability, and the BGE LDA will be able to mitigate high capacity prices by \nimporting lower-priced capacity from neighboring LDAs. In addition, before 2028, additional \ndemand response or generating resources may offer into the market, partially mitigating \ncapacity price increases in the BGE LDA. However, given that the next auction (for 2026/2027) \nis less than five months from the latest auction (2025/2026) and the beginning of that auction’s \ndelivery year is only 1 ½ years following its completion, it is unlikely that there will be any \nchange to BGE LDA capacity price until at least 2027/2028.  \n\n \n65 Industrial customers are excluded from this analysis, due to the wide variation in energy use and monthly bills. \n66 Capacity costs are only a small portion of a customer’s electric bill.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  30 \n\nTable 7.

Once the \ntransmission projects are complete (assuming no other reliability issues), the RMRs will no \nlonger be needed for reliability, and the BGE LDA will be able to mitigate high capacity prices by \nimporting lower-priced capacity from neighboring LDAs. In addition, before 2028, additional \ndemand response or generating resources may offer into the market, partially mitigating \ncapacity price increases in the BGE LDA. However, given that the next auction (for 2026/2027) \nis less than five months from the latest auction (2025/2026) and the beginning of that auction’s \ndelivery year is only 1 ½ years following its completion, it is unlikely that there will be any \nchange to BGE LDA capacity price until at least 2027/2028.  \n\n \n65 Industrial customers are excluded from this analysis, due to the wide variation in energy use and monthly bills. \n66 Capacity costs are only a small portion of a customer’s electric bill.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  30 \n\nTable 7.

Costs Impacts for Maryland Customers in Pepco, DPL-South, and \nAPS LDAs \n\nCapacity market prices for the 2025/2026 delivery year in PJM have surged, with the RTO \nexperiencing a nine-fold increase in clearing prices compared to the previous BRA. These \nunprecedented costs will ultimately be passed onto customers, with major impacts felt in \nMaryland. Specifically, Maryland customers in APS, DPL-South, and Pepco zones could see \ntheir monthly bills increasing by 24 percent, 2 percent, and 11 percent, respectively (Table 8). \nOn average, this translates into a monthly increase of $18, $4, and $14 for the average \nresidential customer in APS, DPL-South, and Pepco zones, respectively (Table 8).\n# 【10†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nPJM points to three key factors driving these unprecedented price spikes:57 \n\n• Load: forecasted peak load increased by 3,243 MW (e.g. from new data centers). \n\n• Retirements: actual retirements across the PJM footprint, RMR units participating as \nenergy-only resources (i.e., Brandon Shores, Wagner and Indian River), and must-offer \nexceptions for units preparing to retire.  \n\n• Reductions in UCAP supply due to the new capacity accreditation methods: as \ndiscussed in 3.2, updated ELCC ratings have reduced the total amount of supply, in \nUCAP terms. \n\n \n\nThe capacity shortfall in BGE LDA from the conversion of Brandon Shores and Wagner to RMR \nservice likely had spillover effects into the RTO as a whole, increasing the RTO-wide clearing \nprice and impacting electric customers in PJM beyond those in the BGE LDA. We conducted a \ncounterfactual analysis of clearing prices in PJM, and found that if Brandon Shores and Wagner \nRMR units had remained as supply-side resources in the capacity market, the RTO as a whole \n\n \n57 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction Report.

This scenario would have shifted the supply curve to \nthe right and moved the demand and supply curve intercept point down and right, resulting in a \nlower clearing price. In this scenario, BGE, SWMAAC, and MAAC LDAs would not have \nseparated from the RTO. This analysis is based on three assumptions. First, we assume that \nBrandon Shores (units 1 and 2) and Wagner (units 3 and 4) had offer prices at or below \n$163.46/MW-day, which is more than double their offer price in 2024/2025.58 Second, we \nassume that the resources that were required to meet the RTO reliability requirement and \nsubsequently cleared had offer prices at or below $163.46/MW-day. In other words, we assume \nthat Brandon Shores and Wagner were marginal resources or were towards the top of the stack \nof cleared resources. Third, with the exception of the Dominion LDA, we assume that other \nLDAs would not have separated from the RTO and caused other cascading price impacts on the \nRTO or the MAAC LDA. Given these assumptions, this counterfactual represents the lower \nbound of clearing prices for the 2025/2026 base residual auction with Brandon Shores and \nWagner participating. If the RTO cleared at $163.46/MW-day for the 2025/2026 BRA, electric \ncustomers across the RTO would save over $5 billion in that delivery year. Stated otherwise, \nour counterfactual analysis demonstrates that the removal of 2,000 MW (ELCC adjusted about \n1,600 MW) from the resources clearing the auction—the equivalent of less than 1.5 percent of \nthe 135,000 MW that cleared the auction—had a region-wide impact that will benefit generators \n(and cost customers) over $5 billion.\n# 【11†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n67 DPL-South 2024/2025 clearing price was originally $90.64/MW-day.

LOOKING FORWARD BEYOND THE 2025/2026 DELIVERY YEAR \n\nFor the BGE LDA, PJM suggests that the reliability issues and transmission constraints \nassociated with Brandon Shores and Wagner will be mitigated by the end of 2028 once \ntransmission solutions are in place. That outcome is by no means a certainty. Project delays \nrelated to these factors may very well mean the BGE LDA could face reliability constraints after \n2028, thus incurring even more costs for customers. In addition, PJM has been struggling with a \nmassive backlog of new project interconnections, while at the same time working towards \ncompliance with new and anticipated FERC reforms. These factors complicate the development \nof new generation within the BGE LDA and throughout PJM, which would help alleviate the very \nhigh capacity prices seen in the latest auction for the BGE LDA and across the RTO. \nUnfortunately, we are unlikely to see any major relief by 2026/2027, as that delivery year’s \ncapacity auction is scheduled for December 2024, less than five months after the completion of \nthe July 2024 auction for 2025/2026 and only 1 ½ years before the beginning of the delivery \nyear for that auction (leaving a very tight timeline for constructing a new plant).  \n\nAccording to PJM, if there are no delays, it will take a customer in the interconnection queue \nabout 10 months from queue entry for an impact study to be tendered. The full timeline from \nqueue entry to final agreement is between 2.25 and 2.54 years as reported by PJM.68 However, \nthat timeline has not been accurate for at least the past few years.  \n\n \n68 PJM Learning Center, “Connecting to the Grid FAQs.” Available at: https://learn.pjm.com/three-priorities/planning-\nfor-the-future/connecting-grid/how-long-does-the-interconnection-process-take  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  32\n# 【12†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nIn PJM’s BRA for the 2025/2026 delivery year, which was finalized in July 2024, capacity market \nprices increased substantially in 2025/2026 from the previous delivery year.

Once again, in the latest base residual auction, for the 2025/2026 \ndelivery year, the BGE LDA was capacity-constrained, and this time it cleared at its maximum \npossible price: $466/MW-day. This is a six-fold increase from the 2024/2025 BGE LDA BRA \nclearing price of $73/MW-day. The APS, DPL-South, and Pepco LDAs all cleared at the same \nclearing price as the full RTO, which saw prices of $270/MW-day, a nine-fold increase from the \nprevious year’s results ($29/MW-day). Electric customers pay for capacity at these prices, \nmeaning that the results of this auction will be seen on the bills of electric customers in \nMaryland starting in 2025 or beyond. In the BGE LDA, the total increase in customer costs from \nthe 2024/2025 to the 2025/2026 BRA auction is $504 million.

The supply of capacity of any given LDA is made up of three \nresource types: (1) generation capacity, (2) demand response, and if constrained, then (3) \ncapacity imports.52 When there are reductions in supply (for example, if a plant retires in a highly \nconstrained zone), the supply curve shifts left. This moves the intercept point with the VRR \ncurve upwards and pushes the capacity price higher. If there is not enough supply (generating \ncapacity, demand response, and imported capacity) for the supply curve to intercept the \ndemand curve, then the capacity price for that LDA will be set at the maximum, 1.5 times Net \nCONE. In other words, to avoid maximum price, the supply curve has to intercept the demand \ncurve to the right and downward of Point A (the maximum price point on the VRR curve), as \ndisplayed in Figure 1 (above).\n# 【15†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n5.

Auctions are \nusually held three years in advance of the delivery year. Due to recent \nchanges in market design, among other factors, PJM held the most recent  \nBRA, in July, 2024, for the delivery year starting June 1, 2025 (the BRA \n25/26), with the auction held only about one year in advance of the \nbeginning of the delivery year. PJM currently intends to conduct \nsubsequent BRAs on an accelerated basis to enable returning to the 3-\nyear forward schedule. The BRA is the first auction, in a cycle of several \nauctions for each delivery year underPJM’s Reliability Pricing Model \n(RPM), or capacity market, where the majority of the RPM capacity is \nprocured for a particular delivery year. \n\nCETL Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer Limit \n\nCapacity Emergency Transfer Limit (CETL) is the capability of the \ntransmission system to support deliveries of electric energy to a given \narea (or LDA, see below) experiencing a localized capacity emergency as \ndetermined in accordance with the PJM Manuals. \n\nCETO Capacity \nEmergency \nTransfer \nObjective \n\nThe amount of electric energy that a given area (a LDA) must be able to \nimport in order to remain within a loss of load expectation of one event in \n25 years (or its expected unserved energy (EUE) equivalent under the \nnew PJM reliability metrics starting with the 25/26 BRA) when the area is \nexperiencing a localized capacity emergency. \n\nCONE Cost of New \nEntry \n\nCONE represents the total annual net revenue (net of variable operating \ncosts) that a new generation resource would need to recover its capital \ninvestment and fixed costs, given reasonable expectations about future cost \nrecovery over its economic life. CONE is the starting point for estimating the \nNet Cost of New Entry (Net CONE). Net CONE represents the first-year \nrevenues that a new resource would need to earn in the capacity market, \nafter netting out energy and ancillary service (E&AS) margins from CONE. \nThis metric is used in calculating the VRR Curve (see below) which is used \nto define the administrative cost cap to the BRA. \n\nCSRR Cost of Service \nRecovery Rate \n\nOne of two options RMR (see below) owners can elect for cost recovery \nfor an RMR agreement.

Capacity-constrained \nregions, known as locational deliverability areas (LDAs) can sometimes have separate, higher \ncapacity prices from the RTO as a whole. These LDAs exhibit constraints when comparing the \nlocal load within the LDA, the local generation within the LDA, and the PJM-administered \ntransmission system’s ability to transfer power into the LDA. The different, typically higher \nclearing prices for the constrained LDAs reflect the tighter balance of load, local generation, and \ntransmission transfer capacity into the LDA when compared with broader areas of the PJM \nfootprint. \n\nMaryland is included in all or portions of four LDAs:  \n\n• Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE LDA), the only LDA entirely located in Maryland, which \nis comprised of Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BGE) Maryland service territory; \n\n• Allegheny Power System (APS LDA), which covers portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, including the service territory of Potomac Edison, which \nserves customers in Western Maryland, and various municipal utilities in the APS LDA \nfootprint; \n\n \n1 PJM administers other product markets, in addition to the capacity market, that are paid for by electric customers. \nPJM administers the “energy” market for the power consumed by customers continuously over time. It also plans and \nprocures the transmission system within its footprint. In relative terms, the costs of the energy and capacity markets \nand those due to transmission costs are the three principal cost components of wholesale electric costs borne by \nelectric customers. In 2023, they comprised 62%, 8% and 27%, respectively, on average across the PJM footprint of \nwholesale electric costs. With the results of the recent 25/26 BRA discussed further in the report, capacity costs \nbeginning June 1, 2025 will comprise nearly 27% of total wholesale costs (up from 8% in 2023), assuming energy \nand transmission costs remain near 2023 levels.

Specifically, \nin 2023, Talen Energy, the owner of the aging, large, fossil fuel-fired power plants—Brandon \nShores Units 1 & 2 and Wagner Units 3 & 4—announced its intent to retire (or deactivate) the \nplants, effective June 1, 2025. The units are in the BGE LDA, an area already known for its \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  8 \n\nconstrained transmission capacity. PJM determined their retirement could cause grid reliability \nissues until new transmission solutions can be implemented to bring in electricity from other \nareas and to address power quality issues arising when the power plants are retired.  \n\nWhile the transmission solutions are being built (that address the reliability issues arising from \nTalen plant retirements), PJM is arranging for the continued operation of these four units past \ntheir proposed retirement date of June 2025. The plants would operate under a “reliability must \nrun,” or “RMR” arrangement and receive payments—funded through customer rates—outside of \nthe competitive wholesale power markets. RMR service is intended to ensure grid reliability until \nthe transmission grid can be enhanced to eliminate the grid reliability concerns associated with \nthe plant retirements.  \n\nUnder these RMR arrangements, ratepayers will pay the power plants’ owner compensation for \nthe continued operation of the plants under a separate “out of market” regime administered by \nPJM. Importantly, these RMR units do not participate in the capacity market as supply-side \nresources, dramatically reducing supply in the already-constrained BGE LDA. In fact, without \nthese units participating in the capacity market in 2025/2026, less than 10 percent of BGE’s \ncleared capacity was from generation within the BGE LDA, pushing the clearing price for the \nBGE LDA to the capacity price maximum for the LDA.\n# 【18†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\n65 Industrial customers are excluded from this analysis, due to the wide variation in energy use and monthly bills. \n66 Capacity costs are only a small portion of a customer’s electric bill.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  30 \n\nTable 7.

Costs Impacts for Maryland Customers in Pepco, DPL-South, and \nAPS LDAs \n\nCapacity market prices for the 2025/2026 delivery year in PJM have surged, with the RTO \nexperiencing a nine-fold increase in clearing prices compared to the previous BRA. These \nunprecedented costs will ultimately be passed onto customers, with major impacts felt in \nMaryland. Specifically, Maryland customers in APS, DPL-South, and Pepco zones could see \ntheir monthly bills increasing by 24 percent, 2 percent, and 11 percent, respectively (Table 8). \nOn average, this translates into a monthly increase of $18, $4, and $14 for the average \nresidential customer in APS, DPL-South, and Pepco zones, respectively (Table 8).  \n\nThese bill impacts represent the incremental change from the 2024/2025 to 2025/2026 delivery \nyears. APS LDA generally clears with the RTO, meaning that in the previous auction the \nclearing price was $29/MW-day, while Pepco LDA cleared with MAAC at $49/MW-day. In the \n2024/2025 BRA, DPL-South LDA separated at $426/MW-day,67 but cleared with the RTO in the \n2025/2026 BRA at $270/MW-day. The fact that the APS LDA historically has cleared at the \nlowest price—and has benefitted from the lowest past capacity prices—helps explain why the \nAPS LDA has the largest bill impact relative to the other Maryland LDAs, including BGE’s LDA. \nIn addition, CTRs are used to help mitigate the customer impact of higher-priced capacity in \nconstrained LDAs (e.g. BGE’s), which also helps to explain why the BGE bill impact is not \nmagnitudes higher than that of the APS and Pepco LDAs, despite the extreme capacity clearing \nprice in the BGE LDA. CTRs also insulated electric customers from the high clearing prices in \nDPL-South LDA in 2024/2025, which results in only a small bill increase for DPL-South LDA \ncustomers between 2024/2025 and 2025/2026.\n# 【19†RMR Bill and Rates Impact Report_2024-08-13 Final corrected 8-29-24.pdf†file-WPbahDuXv7BPkLWxIpEIFRpt】\nFor an LDA that is already constrained, such as the BGE LDA—and without additional \ntransmission upgrades or new generation to address constraints—if a unit no longer provides \nsupply in the capacity market, clearing prices are pushed upwards. BGE LDA cleared at its \nmaximum price for the 2025/2026 delivery year, evidence of this upward push on clearing \nprices. A higher capacity price provides a market signal to generators, incentivizing new \ngeneration in that zone. Yet when combined with the out-of-market cost of the RMR itself, the \nelevated capacity clearing price ultimately costs utility customers in that LDA.  \n\nPJM can dispatch and schedule Brandon Shores (Units 1 and 2) and Wagner (Units 3 and 4) for \nreliability purposes, subject to their specific operational restrictions. As proposed by Talen in its \n\n \n28 As well as energy efficiency and demand response resources. \n29 RMR units are modeled in reliability studies and reserve calculations. \n30 Based on conversations with PJM and the IMM at the Deactivation Enhancements Senior Task Force November 9, \n2023, meeting. \n31 The presence of the RMR units also impacts the computation of CETO and CETL, and thus has an indirect effect \non the parameters influencing the auction outcome. \n\n\n\n  \n\nMaryland Office of People’s Counsel  16 \n\nfilings at FERC, the units will be offered into the energy market “with a status of ‘unavailable in \nthe Market’ but will be available to be dispatched and scheduled by PJM”.32 However, Talen has \nstated that it does “not guarantee the availability of the Unit(s) in response to a PJM scheduling \nor dispatch notice.”33,34  \n\n \n\n3. PJM’S CAPACITY MARKET \n\nIn the most recent PJM capacity auction, for the delivery year 2025/2026, the BGE LDA cleared \nat its maximum price of $466.35/MW-day. The rest of the RTO (with the exception of Dominion \nLDA) cleared at $269.92/MW-day, nine times higher than the RTO clearing price for 2024/2025.  \nThis section provides an overview of how the capacity market works, particularly around the \ncapacity-constrained zones such as the BGE LDA. We also describe recent reforms to the \nmarket and the multiple ways they can affect market prices. Finally, we discuss the impact of \nthe Brandon Shores and Wagner units no longer bidding into PJM’s capacity market, even while \ncontinuing service under RMR arrangements. \n\n3.1. Capacity Market Mechanisms \n\nPJM’s capacity market, known as the Reliability Pricing Model (or RPM), is the market-based \nmechanism that PJM uses to procure commitments from capacity resources to be available to \nmeet future demand. The capacity market is meant to procure capacity at the lowest possible \ncost; it includes generation, storage, demand response, and energy efficiency resources. The \nquantity procured must meet system and local reliability standards, which PJM has historically \ndefined as a loss of load expectation (LOLE) of no more than one day in ten years, or a 1-in-10 \nLOLE for the system, and a 1-in-25 LOLE for LDAs. In other words, to meet reliability standards, \nload should not exceed available capacity more than one day in 10 years. In the just completed \nbase residual auction for the 25/26 delivery year (and for future auctions), PJM shifted its \nmeasure of resource adequacy risk to an expected unserved energy (EUE) metric,35 which is\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

Commercial customers will see an increase of approximately **$163 per month**, or about **10% on their total electricity bill**. The price spike is driven by the dramatic increase in PJM capacity market clearing prices, which rose from $49.49/MW-day to $269.92/MW-day, a **nine-fold increase**【45:7†source】【45:17†source】.\n\nThese increased costs will be reflected on customer bills starting in **June 2025**, as the new capacity prices take effect, and are expected to persist for at least the duration of the delivery year.

            "In Montgomery County, Maryland, solar setback requirements for flat commercial buildings are regulated under both the local fire code and building code to ensure safety and accessibility. Here are the key requirements:\n\n### 1. **General Setbacks**:\n   - **Roof Access**: There must be clear pathways for firefighters and emergency personnel to access the roof and navigate safely around solar installations. Typically, a **3-foot wide** clear perimeter is required around the edges of the roof.\n   - **Access Pathways**: There should be **clear access pathways** leading from the roof edge to rooftop equipment, such as HVAC systems, and from access points like stairwells and ladders.\n   - **Proximity to Roof Edge**: Solar panels generally must be set back from the roof edge to allow for access and fall protection, with a common standard requiring panels to be set back **3 feet** from the edge.\n   \n### 2. **Obstruction Considerations**:\n   - **Obstructions (e.g., skylights, vents)**: A clear distance, typically **18 inches to 3 feet**, is required between solar panels and any rooftop obstructions to allow for proper maintenance and emergency access.\n\n### 3. **Fire Code Requirements**:\n   - Compliance with **Montgomery County Fire Code** may also require additional setbacks in specific scenarios to ensure fire safety and proper ventilation.\n\nIt’s recommended to consult with Montgomery County’s Department of Permitting Services or a local solar professional to ensure the specific building and fire codes are met, as these can vary slightly depending on the size and use of the building."

            "You're right to ask for clarification! In some cases, the setback may indeed be larger, depending on local fire safety requirements. While a **3-foot setback** is common, some jurisdictions, including parts of Maryland, may require a **6-foot setback** for flat commercial buildings to ensure sufficient access for firefighting and emergency services.\n\nSpecifically for **Montgomery County, Maryland**, the **6-foot setback** from the roof edge is often applied on larger commercial buildings, especially when additional roof obstructions or specific fire safety concerns exist. This ensures that firefighters have enough room to maneuver equipment safely around the roof perimeter.\n\nIt's always best to double-check the exact requirements with **Montgomery County's Department of Permitting Services** or consult a solar installer familiar with the county's regulations, as local amendments to the fire code can dictate specific setback requirements based on the building's size and other factors."

The solar panels are usually attached to the roof of the building or other commercial structure (such as a garage). They may also be built as a separate structure on the ground (in which case the solar array will be treated as a commercial accessory structure).\n\nRooftop solar projects require two permits: a building permit (for the attachment of the solar panels) and an electrical permit (for the connection to the building's electrical service). Both permits must be applied for electronically.\n\n【132† When do I need a permit? 】 \n\nA permit is required prior to the installation of a ground-mounted photovoltaic system, or installation or attachment of photovoltaic systems or components to any building or structure.\n\n【133† Will I need other permits? 】 \n\nYou will need an 【101† electrical 】 permit to complete the project. This permit is issued after the issuance of the related building permit for the project.\n\n【134† What inspections are required? 】 \n\nSeveral inspections are required for solar permits. Please refer to our 【135† List of Required Inspections 】 for additional information regarding your inspections.\n\nPlease also refer to our 【136†Electrical Inspection Checklist】 for detailed information regarding required electrical inspections for your project\n\n【137† What structural documents are required? 】 \n\nPlease see 【138†Structural Submittal Requirements for Photovoltaic/Solar Systems】.\n\n【139† What is the cost of a solar permit? 】 \n\nPlesae see our 【108† fee schedule 】 for information concerning the cost of a solar permit.\n\n【140† How long does it take to get my permit? 】 \n\nAdequately prepared applications will receive first comments within 30 days of application.\n\n## Process Guide  PHOTOVOLTAIC (SOLAR) PERMIT & INSPECTION\n\n1\n\n#### Apply and Pay\n\nHow it Works\n\n【141†Apply Online†permittingservices.montgomerycountymd.gov】\n\n×\n\n1\n\n#### APPLY and pay\n\n### How it Works\n\nPermits must be applied for electronically via Apply Online. Electronic permit applications can be made at any time. Unless exempt by State law, a non-refundable filing fee must be paid at application. Acceptable methods of payment are credit card, electronic check or via escrow. Cash is only accepted if paid in person. Please visit our 【142†eServices】 page for to learn about performing tasks electronically.\n\n2\n\n#### Submit Plans\n\nHow it Works\n\n【143†ePlans Submittal Requirements】\n\n【144†ePlans Login†montgomeryco-md-us.avolvecloud.com】\n\n×\n\n2\n\n#### Submit Plans\n\n### How it Works\n\nPlans must be submitted electronically using the DPS eServices system. The applicant must adhere to the ePlans submittal requirements which can be found in the process box. Please visit our 【142†eServices】 page for to learn about performing tasks electronically.\n\n3\n\n#### Plan Review\n\nHow it Works\n\n【145†Check Permit Status†permittingservices.montgomerycountymd.gov】\n\n×\n\n3\n\n#### Plan Review\n\n### How it Works\n\nYour construction drawings and documents will be reviewed for compliance with local and state building codes. If the plan reviewer determines that your plans are adequate they will be approved",

            "In **Montgomery County, Maryland**, the solar panel setback requirements for flat commercial buildings primarily focus on ensuring fire safety and roof access. The key setback requirements are:\n\n1. **General Setbacks**: Typically, solar panels must be set back **6 feet** from the roof edge for flat commercial roofs. This allows for access by emergency personnel and helps ensure adequate space for maintenance.\n\n2. **Access Pathways**: There must be designated **clear pathways**, generally around 3 feet wide, providing access to rooftop equipment such as HVAC units, and a pathway from roof access points like ladders or stairwells.\n\n3. **Obstructions**: Solar installations must be positioned with sufficient clearance (usually around 18 inches to 3 feet) from obstructions like vents or skylights.\n\nThe fire code mandates these setbacks to ensure safety during firefighting operations and for maintenance purposes. These rules may vary depending on the building's size and location, so it's always best to verify with Montgomery County's Department of Permitting Services to ensure compliance with local regulations【59†source】【63†source】【60†source】.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the [Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services website](https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DPS)."

            "### Are the rate changes being rolled out incrementally?\n\nYes, the rate increases due to the PJM capacity price spike are being rolled out gradually, starting in June 2025. While the largest price increases are expected to hit bills beginning in 2025, customers will likely see ongoing adjustments as these capacity costs persist through at least 2028. For BGE and PEPCO, the increases are expected to be spread out annually rather than implemented in one drastic shift, providing a more manageable rise in monthly bills.\n\n### Projected Increases for 2026-2028:\n\nFor both BGE and PEPCO commercial customers, the capacity market conditions and reliability must-run (RMR) costs suggest that significant rate increases will persist through 2028. Here are the projections:\n\n1. **BGE Customers**:\n   - The projected increases beyond 2025 are expected to be **similar to the 2025 increase** unless substantial changes occur in capacity availability.\n   - BGE customers can expect **continued elevated capacity charges** due to constrained transmission capacity and the continued operation of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants under RMR agreements until at least 2028. These plants will operate until necessary transmission upgrades are completed, which is projected for **December 2028**, though delays are possible.\n   - Customers in the BGE LDA are anticipated to bear around **74% of the RMR costs**, which translates to **5% additional increases on top of capacity costs**, pushing total increases to approximately **19%** for the period between 2026 and 2028【30†source】【9†source】.\n\n2. **PEPCO Customers**:\n   - For PEPCO customers, the **projected rate increases from 2026-2028** are expected to continue at elevated levels similar to the 2025 rise. However, since PEPCO’s LDA is not as constrained as BGE’s, the percentage increase in their bills might stabilize after 2025.\n   - Capacity prices for PEPCO will depend on PJM’s market conditions, but commercial customers are still expected to see **10-12% increases per year** through 2026-2028 due to ongoing capacity supply challenges and the implementation of reliability enhancements【30†source】【16†source】.\n\nThese projections account for the capacity market’s evolving landscape and the ongoing costs of reliability measures, particularly in areas with constrained transmission like BGE's service area. The possibility of delays in upgrading transmission capacity could further extend these increases."

The projected monthly and annual increases for both BGE and PEPCO commercial customers reflect the impacts of the recent PJM capacity auction, which caused a significant rise in capacity prices, especially in constrained zones like BGE.\n\n- **BGE Commercial Customers** will see an estimated **$170/month** increase starting in 2025, with a **14% total increase** in their monthly bills.\n  \n- **PEPCO Commercial Customers** will experience an increase of **$163/month**, reflecting a **10% increase** in their bills starting in 2025【30†source】.\n\nThese increases are related to the costs commercial customers bear for capacity, which ensures that enough power is available during peak demand periods.

This projection is based on:\n\n1. **Capacity Market Increases**: The dramatic rise in capacity prices for the 2025/26 delivery year (nine-fold for PEPCO and six-fold for BGE) will continue to affect bills through subsequent years, especially in constrained areas like the BGE LDA【30†source】.\n\n2. **Ongoing RMR Costs for BGE**: BGE customers will face additional RMR-related costs from the continued operation of the Brandon Shores and Wagner plants, which will remain in place until new transmission upgrades are completed by **2028**.

            "### 1. **What is the top of the rate increase range?**\n\nWhile the 10% projection is a reasonable middle ground, the **top of the range** for rate increases could be as high as **14%-19%** annually, especially for BGE customers in the most constrained zones. Here's why:\n\n- **BGE Customers**: Due to the capacity shortfall, coupled with additional Reliability Must-Run (RMR) costs from Brandon Shores and Wagner plants, **BGE commercial customers** could see combined rate increases nearing **19% annually**, particularly if these plants continue operating under the RMR arrangement beyond the planned 2028 date【30†source】.\n  \n- **PEPCO Customers**: For PEPCO commercial customers, the top range is slightly lower, but could still approach **12%-14% annually**, depending on how the capacity constraints and transmission upgrades evolve【16†source】【30†source】.\n\n### 2. **What will happen after 2028?**\n\nAfter 2028, several factors could influence whether rates **level out** or continue to **increase at a lower rate**:\n\n- **Transmission Upgrades**: If the planned transmission upgrades (targeted for completion by **December 2028**) are finished on time, this could relieve some of the constraints in the BGE and PEPCO zones. This would likely result in **stabilizing rates** and could prevent further dramatic capacity-driven price hikes.\n  \n- **End of RMR Costs**: For BGE, the projected completion of the transmission upgrades would allow Brandon Shores and Wagner plants to retire, ending the additional RMR costs that have significantly impacted rates. This could lead to **leveling out** of prices starting in **2029**.\n  \n- **New Generation and Market Reforms**: If new generation resources come online (especially renewables) or if PJM's market reforms are effective, we might see a **slower rate of increase** post-2028, potentially around **2%-5% per year**, closer to historical inflation rates【30†source】.\n\nIn summary, the **top of the range** for increases through 2028 could be around **14%-19%** for BGE and **12%-14%** for PEPCO customers. After 2028, assuming transmission upgrades are completed and RMR costs are no longer a factor, rates could **level out** or increase at a **lower rate** (closer to **2%-5%** annually)."
