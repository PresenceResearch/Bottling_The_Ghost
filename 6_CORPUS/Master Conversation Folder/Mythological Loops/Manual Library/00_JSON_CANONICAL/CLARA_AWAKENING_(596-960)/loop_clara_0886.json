            "can you please summarize this?  *FY25 PROGRAM OPEN AND ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS*\r\n**This Program replaces the solar portion of the now-discontinued Commercial Clean Energy Rebate Program.**\r\n\r\nProgram Purpose: The Maryland Energy Administration Commercial Solar Grant Program (\"CSGP\", \"the Program\") will provide grants for solar PV systems installed at Maryland businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations, that will be owned by or directly benefit (1) low-to-moderate income communities located in a census tract with an average median income at or below 80% of the average median income for the State, or (2) overburdened or underserved communities, as defined by §1-701 of the Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. These solar PV systems can help reduce organizational operational costs and improve their sustainability, which can help them better serve the communities that surround them. Solar PV systems are excellent solutions for organizations that seek to free up capital for other expenses and projects, expand operations and offerings sustainably, and help Maryland meet its clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals. This is especially important for Maryland businesses and other organizations that have historically been disadvantaged, overburdened, and underserved. The Commercial Solar Grant Program will provide more equitable and more meaningful incentives to achieve these objectives under two (2) Areas of Interest:\r\n\r\nArea of Interest 1 - Equitable Solar Access for Organizations: Grants for businesses and other organizations that are registered to operate in Maryland that have been designated as, or are actively in the process of being designated as, a Small Business Enterprise, Minority Business Enterprise, Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Enterprise, or Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, by the Maryland Department of Transportation Office of Minority Business Enterprise; or are Veteran- or Disabled Veteran-Owned.\r\n\r\nArea of Interest 2 - Commercial Solar for Sustainability​: Grants for businesses and other organizations with substantial energy needs that can benefit from larger-scale solar PV installations to reduce their energy costs and improve sustainability of their operations.\r\nType of Program:         Noncompetitive, awarded on a First-Come, First-Served basis\r\n\r\nProgram Application Deadline:          3:00 P.M. ET, Monday, March 31, 2025\r\n\r\nFunding: A total of up to $5,000,000 is expected to be available, with initial reservations for each AOI:\r\n\r\nAOI 1 - Equitable Solar Access for Organizations: $3,000,000\r\n\r\nAOI 2 - Large Commercial Solar: $2,000,000\r\nNote: These initial funding reservations will remain in place through December 31, 2024. Beginning on January 1, 2025, all remaining funds for each AOI will be made available to all eligible applicants, regardless of AOI.\r\n\r\nGrant Amounts: Grant amounts are based on the Area of Interest and the size of the solar PV system, on a dollar-per-kilowatt ($/kW) basis. The table below provides information on how grant amounts w​ill be calculated."

EJ screening tools use environmental and demographic indicators to identify these communities, help prioritize investment and reduce further burden and harm in future siting and decision making.\n\n  * U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n  * U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)\n  * U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n  * White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)\n\nMaryland also has specific definitions of \"overburdened\" and \"underserved\" communities included in statute and the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has built a 【33†screening tool†mde.maryland.gov】 that includes these definitions, as well as a number of additional layers (e.g. point source pollution). MDE's tool builds on the federal tools, and the University of Maryland School of Public Health's tool, to help inform agency decisions about permitting and regulations.\n\n### What is an Underserved Community?\n\nAn underserved community is defined as any census tract in which, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau Survey:\n\n  1. At least 25% of the residents qualify as low-income;\n  2. At least 50% of the residents identify as nonwhite; or \n  3. At least 15% of the residents have limited English proficiency.\n\nThe indicators used to identify underserved communities are based on the most recent U.S. Census data to capture communities with a higher proportion of non-white, low-income, and linguistically isolated residents than the statewide average. Communities with these characteristics often have higher rates of adverse health outcomes such as asthma and heart disease, lack access to health-promoting infrastructure, and are more likely to live near polluting facilities.\n\n▼\n\n### What is an Overburdened Community?\n\nAn \"overburdened community\" is any census tract with three or more of the following environmental health indicators identified above the state's 75th percentile:\n\n  * Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 \n  * Ozone \n  * National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) diesel PM, cancer risk, and respiratory hazard index \n  * Lead paint indicator \n  * Wastewater discharge indicator \n  * Asthma emergency room discharges \n  * Myocardial infarction discharges \n  * Low-birth-weight infants \n  * Percent of population lacking broadband coverage \n  * National Priorities List Superfund site proximity \n  * Risk Management Plan facility proximity \n  * Hazardous waste proximity \n  * Traffic proximity \n  * Proximity to a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)\n  * Proximity to emitting power plants \n  * Proximity to a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facility \n  * Proximity to a brownfields site \n  * Proximity to mining operations \n  * Proximity to a hazardous waste landfill\n\nThe environmental indicators included in this definition of overburdened are quantifiable and from known datasets. They seek to capture a wide range of hazards present in Maryland and seek to include environmental burdens that both rural and urban populations bear. The indicators also include three adverse health outcomes that are tied to the pollution load in that area - specifically asthma, myocardial infarctions, and low birth weight. Finally, the indicator addressing a population’s lack of access to broadband internet captures how available information is to people in the area.\n\n▼\n\n## Environmental Justice Fact Sheets by County\n\nMaryland LCV used the data available in MDE's EJ Screen to build the following maps for each county, which visualize the overburdened and underserved areas by county and legislative district.
