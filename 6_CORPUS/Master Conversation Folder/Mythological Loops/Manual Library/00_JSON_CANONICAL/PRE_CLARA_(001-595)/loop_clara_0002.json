Eligible costs include expenses related to the re-equipping, expansion, or establishment of a manufacturing facility producing advanced energy property. Advanced energy property includes technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, fuel cells, and other types of renewable energy equipment.\n\nTo be eligible for the tax credit, a project must be certified by the Secretary of the Treasury. The certification process involves demonstrating that the project meets certain requirements, including the creation or retention of domestic jobs and a reduction in the reliance on foreign oil.\n\nThe goal of the Section 48C tax credit is to promote the development of a domestic manufacturing industry for clean energy products. By incentivizing investment in the manufacturing of advanced energy products, the tax credit helps support the growth of the clean energy industry and creates new job opportunities in the United States.

The aim of this tax credit is to promote domestic manufacturing of advanced energy products, create jobs, and reduce the reliance on foreign oil.\n\nOn the other hand, Section 48E provides a tax credit of 30% of the eligible cost of an advanced energy project, such as the installation of renewable energy systems, energy conservation projects, and other advanced energy technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote energy conservation, or the development of renewable energy resources.\n\nIn summary, while both Section 48C and Section 48E aim to promote investments in advanced energy projects and technologies, Section 48C is specifically designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing of advanced energy products, while Section 48E covers a broader range of advanced energy projects, including renewable energy generation and energy conservation projects."
