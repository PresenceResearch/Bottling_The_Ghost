That is the story of the 2008 financial crisis. It was disastrous at the time, but what has been worse is how long it has lingered\"【22†source】.\n\n2. Paul Samuelson highlighted the complexity and unknowns of the crisis: \"What we know about the global financial crisis is that we don't know very much\"【22†source】.\n\n3.

            "Certainly, here are additional quotes on the 2008 financial crisis:\n\n4. John Kennedy stressed the public's memory of the bailouts: \"I bet taxpayers remember providing more than $812 billion to Citigroup and Bank of America, two Wall Street banks, in 2009 to bail them out during the 2008 financial crisis. Taxpayers remember that generosity; big banks evidently don't\"【22†source】.\n\n5. George W. Bush cautioned against using the crisis as a pretext to increase taxes: \"The financial crisis should not become an excuse to raise taxes, which would only undermine the economic growth required to regain our strength\"【22†source】.\n\n6. Paul Polman suggested the crisis revealed a moral deficit: \"I believe that the financial crisis of 2008/9 exposed more a lack of ethics and morality - especially by the financial sector - rather than a problem of regulation or criminality\"【22†source】.\n\n7. Michael Spence talked about the prolonged recovery: \"There is no question that the recovery from the global recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis has been unusually lengthy and anemic\"【22†source】.\n\nThese insights provide a range of perspectives, from criticism of financial institutions and regulatory frameworks to reflections on the broader economic and moral implications of the crisis."

            "Here are additional quotes that speak to the concept of learning from those you are teaching:\n\n1. Socrates emphasized the facilitative role of the teacher: \"I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think\"【128†source】.\n\n2. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk metaphorically described the self-sacrificing nature of good teachers: \"A good teacher is like a candle – it consumes itself to light the way for others\"【129†source】.\n\n3. Paulo Coelho on the self-driven nature of learning: \"Teaching is only demonstrating that it is possible. Learning is making it possible for yourself\"【130†source】.\n\n4. Scott Hayden highlights the reciprocal love involved in teaching and learning: \"Teachers have three loves: love of learning, love of learners, and the love of bringing the first two loves together\"【131†source】.\n\n5. Thomas Carruthers and William Butler Yeats reflect on the transformative effect of teaching: \"A good teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary... Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire\"【132†source】.\n\nThese quotes underscore the mutual enrichment that characterizes the teaching-learning relationship."
