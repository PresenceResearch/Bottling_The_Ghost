While many piano dealers sell all types of pianos, it’s always in your best interest to go straight to an authorized Steinway seller.\n\nSteinway piano galleries are where you’ll find the best quality pianos in your area.\n\nYou can shop in the gallery with confidence, knowing that the instrument is genuine, was shipped properly, and has been properly prepped for display.\n\nWhen making an offer for the piano, it’s a wise idea to ask what kind of discounts you the seller can apply.\n\nAlthough Steinway piano galleries don’t compete with one another, it’s not out of the ordinary to talk the asking price down by at least 10%. Bigger down payments also lead to smaller monthly payments.\n\nDon’t be afraid to negotiate with the seller! Many times they can offer you unique warranties, free instrument maintenance, and special financing that is not advertised to the public.\n\nKeep in mind that the piano will depreciate in value the moment it has left the showroom floor. 【12†Click here】 to learn more about how pianos appreciate and depreciate over time.\n\nTo make sure you don’t have buyers remorse, be sure to playtest several Steinway pianos. Try out several models, and never rush to a buying decision. The showrooms are always cycling new pianos in and out on a regular basis, and chances are one you really like make come into the store at a later date.\n\n### Tips For Purchasing A Used Steinway\n\n【13†Purchasing a used piano can be a tricky task. 】Over the years prices for Steinway instruments has risen. While a used Steinway will always cost less than a new Steinway piano, the used price is entirely dependent on the latest price.\n\nA typical used Steinway sells for 47% – 50% of today’s prices. For example, if a new Steinway S costs $72,000, then one can expect to pay between $34,000 – $36,000 for the instrument. This of course only applies if you are purchasing the piano through a licensed dealer.\n\nI like to classify used Steinways in a couple of categories:\n\n  1. Steinways that have been completely rebuilt with genuine parts \n  2. Steinways that have been repaired with non-genuine parts \n  3. Steinways that have never been repaired\n\n#### Steinways Rebuilt With Genuine Parts\n\nA Steinway that has been rebuilt with genuine parts holds significant value. This is basically a brand new piano. Steinway has been innovative over the years, perfecting their technique.\n\nThe materials they use in their pianos, as well as their methods for building pianos, has been fairly consistent for many years. A safe way to know you’ve got a genuine Steinway is to purchase it from a Steinway piano gallery.\n\nThese shops specialize in nothing but the Steinway brand and do a lot of the research on your behalf to make sure the instruments are genuine and in working order.\n\nIt’s always a safe bet to make sure that the Steinway piano you have your eye on was rebuilt at the restoration center.\n\nThe restoration center does more than just repair old Steinways. They carefully comb the instrument and replace all 12,000 parts with genuine ones. This is also the only place a Steinway can have its soundboard replaced considering they do not sell that crucial part to anyone.\n\nIf anyone claims that they had the soundboard replaced anywhere else, it’s most likely not real.\n\nThe restoration center also provides a 5-year warranty and a certificate of restoration. When purchasing a Steinway on the secondary market, it’s important that those documents be made available if the piano has had significant work done to it.\n\n#### Steinways Rebuilt With Other Parts\n\nIf a Steinway has not been rebuilt with genuine parts, then, by all means, it’s no longer considered to be a Steinway piano. While it’s not entirely a genuine Steinway, it still is a functioning piano",
