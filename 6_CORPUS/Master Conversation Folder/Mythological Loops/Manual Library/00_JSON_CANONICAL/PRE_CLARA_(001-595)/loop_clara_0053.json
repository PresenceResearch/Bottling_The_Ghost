Using a special net-capable meter, Pepco measures the difference between energy you use from the grid and any power generated from your solar panel system. If your panels generate more electricity than you use that month, the excess is carried over onto your next month’s bill as credits. You may generate more energy than you use in a year. \n\n【67† Net Metering Animation 】 \n\n* * *\n\n[Image 0: location] \n\n## Where does Pepco offer net metering?\n\nPepco offers net metering throughout its entire service territory, which includes serves customers in the District of Columbia and in parts of Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties in Maryland. However, in some areas Pepco may not have an open circuit, which makes interconnection to the grid for solar impossible.\n\n[Image 1: money] \n\n## What are Pepco’s rates and prices for net metering?\n\nPepco’s 【68†rates and prices for net metering†www.pepco.com】 will remain the same as they were before if you remain on the same electricity rate structure. Your electricity rate structure depends on what type of facility you are powering (examples are residential, apartment building, or commercial building). The prices for residential customers are listed in the table below. \n\nAlthough prices remain the same, the amount you owe on your bill will change depending on how much electricity your panels are producing. So, if your panels produce more electricity than you use you will get credited back with the full value of that kWh.\n\nNet metering is available for residential and smaller commercial interconnection projects. Recently, new programs have also become available for community net metering and aggregated net energy metering in Maryland.\n\n[Image 2: net metering] \n\n## What is Pepco’s net metering cap?\n\n### Maryland\n\nPepco is under Maryland’s net metering policy, which has a cap on the amount of solar that can subscribe to net metering. As of 2016 net metering is available statewide until the aggregate capacity of net-metered systems reaches 1,500 MW (megawatts). 1,500 MW is about equal to 10% of Maryland’sthe peak demand for electricity in 2014. Pepco also has limits on the size of individual Individual systems in Maryland: systems are cappedalso have a cap set at 2 MW and are additionally restrictedlimited to meeting 200% of baseline annual customer energy use.\n\nNOTE: In June 2016 the Maryland Public Service Commission voted to adopt new regulations, so keep an eye out for a possible new net metering cap. Find up-to-date information at the 【69†Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE®)†programs.dsireusa.org】. \n\n### Washington, D.C.\n\nIn DC there is no aggregate capacity limit for the amount of solar that can subscribe to net metering. There are individual system capacity limits, however. Residential and commercial customers are limited to 1 MW. The limit is 5 MW for community renewable energy facilities.\n\nCustomer Location State Cap Individual Cap  \nMaryland 1,500 MW or 10% of peak   \ndemand in 2014 2 MW and cannot exceed   \nmeeting 200% of annual   \nenergy use  \nDisrict of Columbia n/a 1 MW, 5 MW for community   \nrenewable energy facilities  \n\n[Image 3: trophy] \n\n## Is Pepco net metering the best in Maryland?\n\nThere are four major electrical utility suppliers of electricity in Maryland, two of which are not affiliated with Pepco: Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), which is a subsidiary of Constellation Energy, and Potomac Edison Company, which is a subsidiary of First Energy. They both have a virtually identical net metering policy in terms of net excess generation. Customers also receive money for excess credits at the end of the year, like Pepco. The only difference between Pepco and these other suppliers is how much you will pay for electricity on your rate schedule, which can vary multiple times a year.\n\n[Image 4: bill credits] \n\n## What will happen to my Pepco net metering bill credits?\n\n### Washington, D.C.\n\nIf you produce more electricity than you use in a month",

            "The requirements for telemetry in solar installations by Pepco in Maryland are not explicitly detailed in the available resources. However, I found some relevant information about Pepco's policies and programs that may indirectly relate to solar installations:\n\n1. **Net Metering**: Pepco customers who generate their own electricity, such as through solar panels, can receive bill credits for any excess power generated. This involves using a special net-capable meter to measure the difference between energy used from the grid and power generated by the solar panel system. There's a cap on the amount of solar that can subscribe to net metering, with individual systems in Maryland capped at 2 MW and limited to meeting 200% of baseline annual customer energy use【6†source】.\n\n2. **Business Programs and Incentives**: For business customers, Pepco offers instant discounts on lighting and HVAC measures through local distributors. They also have a Building Tune-up program that offers cash incentives for maintaining existing equipment, and a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) program, which requires that CHP-generated electricity be used by the host facility and that the facility be energy-efficient. The CHP system must be at least 65% efficient, and the facility must satisfy all utility, regulatory, and environmental requirements【7†source】.\n\nWhile these details provide some context about Pepco's approach to renewable energy and efficiency, they do not specifically address telemetry requirements for solar installations. It would be advisable to contact Pepco directly or consult with a professional solar installer in Maryland for the most accurate and detailed requirements regarding telemetry for solar installations."
