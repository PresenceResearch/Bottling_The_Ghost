          "text": "\n> “Here’s what I know: Time must be explicitly managed, like money. You can always change your plan, but only if you have one. Ask yourself: Are you spending your time on the right things? Develop a good filing system. Rethink the telephone. Delegate. Take a time out. Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.” \n> \n> Randy Pausch, 【12†The Last Lecture†www.youtube.com】\n\n### 2. Andy Stanley \n\n> Don’t strive to be a well-rounded leader. Instead, discover your zone and stay there. Then delegate everything else. Admitting a weakness is a sign of strength. Acknowledging weakness doesn’t make a leader less effective. Everybody in your organization benefits when you delegate responsibilities that fall outside your core competency. Thoughtful delegation will allow someone else in your organization to shine. Your weakness is someone’s opportunity. Leadership is not always about getting things done “right.” Leadership is about getting things done through other people.\n> \n> Andy Stanle y\n\n### 3. Tim Ferriss\n\n> Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else’s time instead of your own, which now wastes your hard-earned cash. How’s that for incentive to be effective and efficient?\n> \n> T imothy Ferriss, 【13†The 4-Hour Workweek†www.goodreads.com】\n\n### 4. Douglas McGregor\n\n> Delegation means that he will concern himself with the results of their activities and not with the details of their day-to-day performance. This requires a degree of confidence in them which enables him to accept certain risks. Unless he takes these risks there will be no delegation.\n> \n> Douglas McGregor\n\n### 5. James D. Mooney \n\n> Failure to delegate causes managers to be crushed and fail under the weight of accumulated duties that they do not know and have not learned to delegate.\n> \n> James D. Mooney \n\n### 6. Richard Branson \n\n> From a young age, I learned to focus on the things I was good at and delegate to others what I was not good at. That’s how Virgin is run. Fantastic people throughout the Virgin Group run our businesses, allowing me to think creatively and strategically.\n> \n> Richard Branson\n\n### 7.

Jessica Jackley \n\n> As all entrepreneurs know, you live and die by your ability to prioritize. You must focus on the most important, mission-critical tasks each day and night, and then share, delegate, delay or skip the rest.\n> \n> Jessica Jackley\n\n### 10. Anthea Turner\n\n> The first rule of management is delegation. Don’t try and do everything yourself because you can’t.\n> \n> Anthea Turner\n\n## How Do You Know When To Delegate?\n\nTry to delegate the non-technical and non-specialized things that take the most time and mental effort. For example, email management, scheduling, expense reporting, travel booking, todo list and task management, and employee onboarding are all non-technical tasks that take a lot of time. These are 【14†common things people delegate】. However, your specific list is going to depend on your unique situation.\n\n### Delegate Responsibility, Responsibly\n\n【15†What you can delegate】 is dependent on the skill-level of the assistant you’ve hired. Some assistants are great problem solvers and have the organizational skills needed to manage entire teams in pursuit of your strategic goals. Others require lots of hand-holding and micromanagement, and even step-by-step instructions. This is why it’s important for you to get clear on what your needs are, so you can choose what level of assistant you need.\n\n## How To Create A Delegation Task List\n\n### 1. Perform a calendar audit.\n\nGo to your 【16†weekly calendar】 and write out all the different things you do in a given work week. Next to each item write out how long each task takes.\n\n### 2. Cross out the things that only you can do.\n\nGo through your list, item by item, and ask yourself whether you’re the only person who can do the task. If the task is particularly technical or requires knowledge that only you have, cross it out.\n\n### 3. Delegate the most time consuming tasks that someone else can do.\n\nAfter you’re left with a list of tasks that someone else can do, order them according to how much time they require and delegate the most time-consuming ones first. Frame success in clear terms, and spell out any tricky parts of the task, what to do if they run into problem areas, and your ultimate objectives.\n\n## How Do Executive Assistants Add Value?\n\nExecutive Assistants add value by freeing up time for the team and business people they support. From managing email to scheduling meetings, the right assistant with eliminate distractions and let you focus on your business (or your personal life). The 【17†best executive assistants】 can automate many common tasks, as well, which can open up many new possibilities. \n\nOne of the main reasons entrepreneurs make the mistake of hesitating to hire an assistant is because they’re afraid of the costs. But delegating time consuming and mentally draining tasks to an assistant is often the difference between startup success and failure. \n\nWe only have so much time and mental energy each day. The question is not “how expensive is an executive assistant?”, but “how expensive is it for me to not have an executive assistant?”.\n\n## How Do You Find Good Executive Assistants?\n\nGreat assistants are detail oriented, reliable, clear communicators, and great at problem solving. 【18†Finding assistants】 who are all these things is hard. You can post jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards in search of someone who fits this description. Or you can look on a site like Upwork or Fiverr. But the most reliable way to find a great assistant is by using an executive assistant service like Persona.\n\n## What Kinds Of Tasks Can An Executive Assistant Automate?\n\nThe tasks that assistants can automate are as varied as the industries they operate in.\n\nHere’s a sample of what’s possible:\n\n  * Email management\n  * Calendar management\n  * Scheduling\n  * Appointment setting\n  * Expense reporting\n  * Expense tracking\n  * Bookkeeping\n  * Project management\n  * Social media management\n  * Social media content creation\n  * File management and organization\n  * Online purchases\n  * Travel planning\n  * Shopify, Amazon, and e-commerce\n  * Booking flights and hotels\n  * Market research and analysis\n  * Lead generation\n  * Cold outreach\n  * Email list management\n  * Posting ads on Facebook\n  * Posting ads on Google\n  * Posting ads on TikTok\n  * Posting ads on YouTube\n  * Note taking\n  * Meeting minutes\n  * Event planning\n  * Transcription\n  * Content writing\n  * Report writing\n  * Workflow management\n  * Data entry\n  * Data management\n\nThe list goes on and on. \n\n## Does Every CEO Need An Executive Assistant?\n\nYes. Every 【19†CEO】 that values their time and the success of their organization need to hire an executive assistant. Hiring a competent assistant is key to focusing on your strengths and working on the most important, strategic projects for your business.\n\n### Great Business Leaders Master The Art Of Delegation\n\nThe right executive assistant will help you figure out what to delegate, and what you should do yourself. The goal of every executive assistant is helping their executive focus on the most important, mission-critical tasks each day.\n\nOne of the main reasons people fail at delegation is because they don’t hire someone qualified to delegate to. You can’t just hire any virtual assistant or personal assistant. You need someone who’s smart, detail oriented, professional, responsible, reliable, and a great communicator.\n\nSuccessful companies and managers get buried in new tasks and to-dos faster than they can do them. Delegation is a necessary skill. If you don’t delegate, you won’t have enough time to focus on what matters and build a great product, company, or startup. Hiring an assistant can be the difference between 【20†startup success】 and failure.\n\n### Delegation Is The First Rule Of Management For A Reason\n\nRichard Branson discovered what a powerful thing delegation was at an early age. And he credits his success in business to understanding that great 【21†leaders delegate accordingly】 so they can focus on the key skills that drive business growth.\n\nWhen done correctly, delegation can be a powerful tool for leaders. It allows them to focus on the crucial tasks and projects that only they can do, and it empowers other team members to grow and take on more responsibility. Delegation is the simple act of giving someone else responsibility over a task, so you can free up your time to work on something else.\n\nDelegation doesn’t mean abdicating responsibility and assigning all your work to others. The key to successful delegation is to pick the right tasks, assign them to the right people, and to give them the appropriate level of responsibility.\n\n### Delegating to an executive assistant can be the difference between a good entrepreneur and a great one.\n\nEvery great leader knows that they can’t do everything themselves, and delegation is one of a few small things that separates a great business leader from a bad one. Delegating works because it forces you to focus on your key skills. It pushes you to give others in your organization more responsibility and ownership, so that you",

            "While searching for your quote, I found several insightful quotes about effective leadership, delegation, and the importance of focusing on one's strengths while delegating other tasks. However, I did not find the exact quote you're looking for. Here are a few related quotes that echo the sentiment of maximizing efficiency by focusing on one's strengths and delegating other tasks:\n\n1. Andy Stanley: \"Don’t strive to be a well-rounded leader. Instead, discover your zone and stay there. Then delegate everything else... Thoughtful delegation will allow someone else in your organization to shine\"【5†source】.\n   \n2. Timothy Ferriss: \"Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined\"【5†source】.\n\n3. Richard Branson: \"From a young age, I learned to focus on the things I was good at and delegate to others what I was not good at. That’s how Virgin is run\"【5†source】.\n\n4. Frederick W. Smith: \"A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can\"【6†source】.\n\n5. Peter Drucker: \"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things\"【7†source】.\n\nThese quotes emphasize the importance of recognizing one's unique skills and delegating other tasks to ensure organizational efficiency and effectiveness. The concept you are referring to is often associated with the economic principle of \"comparative advantage,\" where individuals and entities are encouraged to engage in tasks where they have the most skill or least opportunity cost, and delegate or trade for others."

          "text": "> \n> Charles Darwin\n\n【22†“The best time to start was last year. Failing that, today will do.” – Chris Guillebeau †twitter.com】【22†Click To Tweet†twitter.com】\n\n### How you can use these to fight off procrastination\n\n【21†Procrastination†rescuetime.wpengine.com】 is less of strictly a time management issue and more of an emotional one. Again, recognizing the issue is the first step in fighting procrastination.\n\nListen to Founding Father Benjamin Franklin when he says that time won’t stop (even if you ignore it). Then, recognize, as Chris Guillebeau said, that even if you have procrastinated, starting now is the best thing you can do.\n\nFinally, get moving by following best-selling author Stephen King’s advice and just start! Researchers have found that 【23†telling yourself you’ll work on something just for 5 minutes†rescuetime.wpengine.com】 is usually enough to break down the emotional barrier and beat procrastination.\n\n## Time management quotes about finding your focus\n\nIf procrastination and planning aren’t issues for you, I’m sure that 【24†focus†rescuetime.wpengine.com】 is.\n\nWe all get caught up in daydreams, 【25†get distracted†rescuetime.wpengine.com】, or simply lose our focus. But getting the most out of your time means being laser-focused when you need to be.\n\nHere are some quotes distilling the secrets to staying focused all day long:\n\n[Image 5: Time management quotes Peter Drucker]\n\n> “You can’t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.”\n> \n> Mark Twain\n\n> “You can have it all. Just not all at once.”\n> \n> Oprah Winfrey\n\n> “The essence of self-discipline is to do the important thing rather than the urgent thing.” \n> \n> Barry Werner\n\n> “Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, add what is specifically your own.” \n> \n> Bruce Lee\n\n> “It’s surprising how much free time and productivity you gain when you lose the busyness in your mind.”\n> \n> Brittany Burgunder\n\n> “It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” \n> \n> Albert Einstein\n\n> “Realize that now, in this moment of time, you are creating. You are creating your next moment. That is what’s real.”\n> \n> Sara Paddison\n\n### How you can use these to get your focus back\n\nAs Einstein puts it, important work deserves your focus. Follow Werner and Drucker’s advice and decide what deserves your attention.\n\nNext, recognize that 【26†you most likely only have 4–5 hours of productive, focused work a day†rescuetime.wpengine.com】. That means that for anything that is “useless”, as Lee says, it’s time to either ditch it or 【27†delegate†rescuetime.wpengine.com】.\n\nRescueTime supercharges your focus by automatically blocking distractions like social media, news, entertainment, and anything else that takes away your attention.   \n\n【28†Get started with RescueTime for free today!†www.rescuetime.com】\n\n## Time management quotes about boosting productivity\n\nThe goal of time management is always 【29†productivity†rescuetime.wpengine.com】—to get more done in less time. However, this doesn’t come down to just planning when you’ll work, but understanding 【7†the best ways how to work†rescuetime.wpengine.com】.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n[Image 6: Time management quotes Paul J Meyer]\n\n> “If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I would spend the first four hours sharpening the axe.”\n> \n> Abraham Lincoln\n\n> “Don’t be fooled by the calendar. There are only as many days in the year as you make use of. One man gets only a week’s value out of a year while another man gets a full year’s value out of a week.”\n> \n> Charles Richards\n\n> “The key is in not spending time, but in investing it.” \n> \n> Stephen R. Covey\n\n> “One can find time for everything if one is never in a hurry.”\n> \n> Mikhail Bulgakov\n\n【30†“Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.” – Warren Buffett †twitter.com】【30†Click To Tweet†twitter.com】\n\n### How you can use these to give your productivity a bump\n\nProductivity doesn’t just happen on its own as Meyer, the founder of the Success Motivation Institute, said. Instead, there are very specific things you need to do to be more productive.\n\nThat means becoming self-aware of 【9†what work drives the biggest results†rescuetime.wpengine.com】, 【31†blocking out external distractions†rescuetime.wpengine.com】, and optimizing your daily schedule to do 【32†the right work at the right time†rescuetime.wpengine.com】.\n\n## Time management quotes about multitasking\n\nIt’s always tempting to try to do more than one thing at a time. But science (and these quotes) show that 【33†multitasking†rescuetime.wpengine.com】 simply isn’t an option if you want to manage your time properly.\n\n[Image 7: Time management quotes Alexander Graham Bell]\n\n> “To do two things at once is to do neither.” \n> \n> Publius Syrus\n\n> “The shorter way to do many things is to only do one thing at a time.” \n> \n> Mozart\n\n> “If you want to make good use of your time, you’ve got to know what’s most important and then give it all you’ve got.”\n> \n> Lee Ia",
