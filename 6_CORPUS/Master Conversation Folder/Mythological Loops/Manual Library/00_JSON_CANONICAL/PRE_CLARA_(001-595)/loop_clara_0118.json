            "Dolphins sleep in a very interesting way. They are able to rest one half of their brain at a time while the other half remains awake. This unique method of sleeping, known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, allows them to continue breathing and to stay alert to potential threats in their environment. Since dolphins need to come to the surface to breathe, this sleep method ensures they can rest without drowning. They often swim slowly and occasionally open one eye during their sleep, keeping themselves aware of their surroundings and group members."
