            "Hydrangeas are primarily known as outdoor plants due to their size and light requirements. However, they can be grown indoors with some care. Here are some considerations if you’re thinking about keeping a hydrangea indoors:\n\n1. **Light**: Hydrangeas need a lot of light, especially to bloom. They require at least a few hours of direct sunlight each day, so a south-facing window is ideal.\n2. **Water**: They need to be kept moist, so regular watering is necessary. The soil should not be allowed to dry out completely.\n3. **Humidity**: Hydrangeas prefer high humidity, which can be challenging to maintain indoors, especially in dry climates or during winter. Using a humidity tray or room humidifier can help.\n4. **Temperature**: They like cooler temperatures and can be sensitive to too much heat, especially indoors during winter when central heating can dry them out.\n\nWith attentive care, you can enjoy a hydrangea indoors, but they might not thrive or bloom as profusely as they would outdoors."
