            "Please create a presentation based on the following outline Presentation \nPlease start with a brief synopsis of the solar industry in the United States emphasizing the introduction of the federal tax credit and go through the ups and downs of the 2010s. Describe the IRA and how it has impacted the industry. \n\nGo through a very basic explanation of how solar works. Sun hits the panels dc electricity to inverters. Inverter turns to AC and then electricity is used by the building just like it is from the utility. Briefly describe how net metering works. \n\nSwitch to the economics of solar. Outline the three major ways you can go solar - purchase PPA and community solar.  Create one slide with examples and reasons why people make that choice for each and then a summary slide with a table comparing the three.  Create criteria that accurately compares the offerings with important metrics.\n\nSplit into two categories, ownership and third party and start with ownership.  This is where we break down the incentives and payback periods.  Create a very basic analysis of how systems generate value and revenue\n\nCost\nNon-production based incentives\n30% Federal Tax Credit\nState Grant / Incentive (If any)\nBonus Depreciation - bring up new legislation \nCould have others on a case by case basis\n\nProduction based incentives \nElectricity savings \nSREC Income \n\nGo into how electricity savings work.  \nFirst we want to know how many kWh you use per year.  Why annual?  Because usage and production can vary greatly month to month.  Show graph of annual usage v annual production and how they differ.  Then show screenshot of maple springs PEPCO bill with overproduction.  Start with rate they are paying and then deduct per kWh.  Remember that your bill will never be $0 because of some fixed costs but it can come close.  \n\nSecond and most importantly we want to know how much your electricity costs because the higher the cost of electricity the more valuable the solar production is.  This is one of the reasons solar took off so quickly in california - power is incredibly expensive there.\n\nThen go into SRECS\nWhat is an SREC - Solar Renewable Energy Credit - it is the GENERATION ATTRIBUTE of the solar produced.  What does this mean.\n\nSome states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard.  This means that the power company is required to include a certain portion of solar energy in the power the distribute.  Some states have none, some states are very aggressive - often aligning with their Carbon Reduction goals.  \n\nCreate slide based on Washington DC RPS and their carbon reduction / carbon neutral goals.  \n\nShould the utility company fail to comply with the RPS they are required to pay a fine, or the ACP (Alternative Compliance Payment).  So for every 1000 kWh (1 kWh) they fall short they pay this fine.\n\nFor example if the requirement is 100 mWh and the utility produces 90 mWh of solar, they are short 10 mWh.  If the fine is $50/mWh then they owe $500.\n\nSo let’s say you own a solar system that produced 10 mWh of solar.  The utility company will ask you if you would kindly let them tell the utility that they actually produced this energy.  You being s savvy businessperson, tell them sure.  But it’s gonna cost them.  So the utility company, being savvy businesspeople themselves, offer to pay you $40 per mWh.  Cheaper for them than paying the finer and you are making money for an asset that you don’t need.  \n\n1mWh = 1 SREC.  Price determined by state RPS and ACP.  This creates the market and price is set by RPS requirement.  Aggressive RPS = strong demand and high prices.  Weak demand = lower prices.  \n\nChart with DC, MD, VA, and NJ\n\nCase Study\n500 kW system \n$1,000,000\n600,000 kWh/year\nDC $.17 kWh $435 SREC\nMD - $.15/kWh - $75 SREC\nVA - $.13/kWh - $35 SREC\nNJ - $.22 kWh - $110/SREC\n30% ITC\n60% Bonus depreciation\n\nPPA What if you don't have $1,000,000 and still want solar?\nPPA = Power Purchase Agreement\n3rd party owns the system\ntakes all of the incentives\nsells you the power at a discount at an agreed upon rate\nrate calculated by market\nrate can be fixed for 25 years\nLock in electricity costs for 25 years\nElectricity rates in the mid-atlantic have been stable for the last 10 years or so but are rising fast.  Paste Press Release for PEPCO/BGE rate increases.  \nShow PPA graph with straight line \nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU CAN USE ALL OF THE POWER ONSITE\n\nWhat if I own a building that is triple net?  Or if the roof is big and the usage is low?  Warehouse for example\nCOMMUNITY SOLAR\nThis is where that third party owns the solar system, keeps all of the incentives, and sells the electricity to third party subscribers\nWhat does this mean for you?  You receive an annual lease payment, an upfront payment, or a combination of the two.  \nThink of it like a cell phone tower on your roof.  You lease the space, do nothing, and get paid.  \nFrequently people will incorporate a new roof into this arrangement if the project economics can support it.  \n\nSo if I can get solar on my roof for free why isn't everyone doing it?\nInsert chart from Colin's presentation.\n\nOK - I'm in - how does this work?\n\n We have an initial discovery call to undetrstand your unique situation.  We determine if solar is viable for your site and what option is best for you.  \nWe information gather (bills, site charactaristics)\nWe run our numbers\nSecond meeting where we present preliminary numbers.  If these make sense for you we \nEnter into LOI/stage.  We perform more thorough analysis - firm up numbers\nPresent final numbers.\nSign agreements\noff we go.\n"

            "Presentation \nAbout me\nAbout Lumina\nbrief synopsis of the solar industry in the United States emphasizing the introduction of the federal tax credit \ngo through the ups and downs of the 2010s. \nDescribe the IRA and how it has impacted the industry. \n\nGo through a very basic explanation of how solar works. Sun hits the panels dc electricity to inverters. Inverter turns to AC and then electricity is used by the building just like it is from the utility. \nBriefly describe how net metering works. \n\nSwitch to the economics of solar. Outline the three major ways you can go solar - purchase PPA and community solar.  \nCreate one slide with examples and reasons why people make that choice for each and then a summary slide with a table comparing the three.  \nCreate criteria that accurately compares the offerings with important metrics\n\nSplit into two categories, ownership and third party and start with ownership.  This is where we break down the incentives and payback periods.  Create a very basic analysis of how systems generate value and revenue\n\nPurchase Option\nNon-production based incentives\n30% Federal Tax Credit\nState Grant / Incentive (If any)\nBonus Depreciation - bring up new legislation \nCould have others on a case by case basis (property tax credit, IRA Adders, REAP)\n\nProduction based incentives \nElectricity savings \nSREC Income \nElectricity Savings\nFirst we want to know how many kWh you use per year.  Why annual?  Because usage and production can vary greatly month to month.  Show graph of annual usage v annual production and how they differ.  \nThen show screenshot of maple springs PEPCO bill with overproduction.  \nStart with rate they are paying and then deduct per kWh.  Remember that your bill will never be $0 because of some fixed costs but it can come close.  \nSecond and most importantly we want to know how much your electricity costs because the higher the cost of electricity the more valuable the solar production is.  This is one of the reasons solar took off so quickly in california - power is incredibly expensive there.\n\nSRECS - What is an SREC - Solar Renewable Energy Credit - it is the GENERATION ATTRIBUTE of the solar produced.  What does this mean?\nSome states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard.  This means that the power company is required to include a certain portion of solar energy in the power the distribute.  Some states have none, some states are very aggressive - often aligning with their Carbon Reduction goals.  \nCreate slide based on Washington DC RPS and their carbon reduction / carbon neutral goals.  \nShould the utility company fail to comply with the RPS they are required to pay a fine, or the ACP (Alternative Compliance Payment).  So for every 1000 kWh (1 kWh) they fall short they pay this fine\nFor example if the requirement is 100 mWh and the utility produces 90 mWh of solar, they are short 10 mWh.  If the fine is $50/mWh then they owe $500.\nSo let’s say you own a solar system that produced 10 mWh of solar.  The utility company will ask you if you would kindly let them tell the utility that they actually produced this energy.  You being a savvy businessperson, tell them sure.  But it’s gonna cost them.  So the utility company, being savvy businesspeople themselves, offer to pay you $40 per mWh.  Cheaper for them than paying the fine and you are making money for an asset that you don’t need.  \n1mWh = 1 SREC.  Price determined by state RPS and ACP.  This creates the market and price is set by RPS requirement.  Aggressive RPS = strong demand and high prices.  Weak demand = lower prices.  \nChart with DC, MD, VA, and NJ\n\nCase Study\n500 kW system DESIGN / $1,000,000 / 30% ITC  / 60% Bonus depreciation\nDC $.17 kWh $435 SREC\nMD - $.15/kWh - $75 SREC\nVA - $.13/kWh - $35 SREC\nNJ - $.22 kWh - $110/SREC\n\n\nPPA What if you don't have $1,000,000 and still want solar?\nPPA = Power Purchase Agreement\n3rd party owns the system\ntakes all of the incentives\nsells you the power at a discount at an agreed upon rate\nrate calculated by market\nrate can be fixed for 25 years\n\nLock in electricity costs for 25 years \nElectricity rates in the mid-atlantic have been stable for the last 10 years or so but are rising fast.  Paste Press Release for PEPCO/BGE rate increases.  \nShow PPA graph with straight line \nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU CAN USE ALL OF THE POWER ONSITE\nWhat if I own a building that is triple net?  Or if the roof is big and the usage is low?  Warehouse for example\n Community Solar\nThis is where that third party owns the solar system, keeps all of the incentives, and sells the electricity to third party subscribers\nWhat does this mean for you?  You receive an annual lease payment, an upfront payment, or a combination of the two.  \nThink of it like a cell phone tower on your roof.  You lease the space, do nothing, and get paid.  \nFrequently people will incorporate a new roof into this arrangement if the project economics can support it.  \nSo if I can get solar on my roof for free why isn't everyone doing it?\nInsert chart from my disco presentation.\nOK - I’m in - how does this work\nWe have an initial discovery call to understand your unique situation.  We determine if solar is viable for your site and what option is best for you.  \nWe information gather (bills, site characteristics)\nWe run our numbers\nSecond meeting where we present preliminary numbers.  If these make sense for you we \nEnter into LOI stage - perform thorough analysis / firm up numbers\nPresent final numbers\nSign agreements\n Off we go!\n\n\n"
