            "Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It represents the decrease in the value of the asset due to wear and tear, age, or obsolescence. In accounting, depreciation allows businesses to spread out the expense of an asset over several years, matching the cost with the revenue it helps generate. This helps provide a more accurate picture of a company's financial health."

            "### Written Example of Depreciation\n\nLet's say a business purchases a piece of equipment for $10,000. The equipment is expected to have a useful life of 5 years and a residual value of $0 at the end of its life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, the business would depreciate the equipment at a rate of $2,000 per year ($10,000/5 years).\n\n### Balance Sheet Illustration\n\n#### Initial Purchase (Year 0)\n\n| **Balance Sheet**          | **Amount** |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| **Assets**                 |            |\n| Cash                       | $10,000    |\n| Equipment                  | $10,000    |\n| **Total Assets**           | $20,000    |\n| **Liabilities and Equity** |            |\n| Equity                     | $20,000    |\n| **Total Liabilities and Equity** | $20,000    |\n\n#### End of Year 1\n\n| **Balance Sheet**          | **Amount** |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| **Assets**                 |            |\n| Cash                       | $10,000    |\n| Equipment                  | $10,000    |\n| Accumulated Depreciation   | -$2,000    |\n| **Net Equipment Value**    | $8,000     |\n| **Total Assets**           | $18,000    |\n| **Liabilities and Equity** |            |\n| Equity                     | $18,000    |\n| **Total Liabilities and Equity** | $18,000    |\n\n#### End of Year 2\n\n| **Balance Sheet**          | **Amount** |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| **Assets**                 |            |\n| Cash                       | $10,000    |\n| Equipment                  | $10,000    |\n| Accumulated Depreciation   | -$4,000    |\n| **Net Equipment Value**    | $6,000     |\n| **Total Assets**           | $16,000    |\n| **Liabilities and Equity** |            |\n| Equity                     | $16,000    |\n| **Total Liabilities and Equity** | $16,000    |\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initial Purchase (Year 0)**: The business buys equipment for $10,000. The balance sheet shows $10,000 in cash and $10,000 in equipment, totaling $20,000 in assets. Equity is also $20,000.\n- **End of Year 1**: The equipment depreciates by $2,000. Accumulated depreciation is recorded as -$2,000, reducing the net value of the equipment to $8,000. Total assets decrease to $18,000, and equity also decreases accordingly.\n- **End of Year 2**: Another $2,000 of depreciation is recorded, further reducing the net equipment value to $6,000. Total assets and equity both decrease to $16,000.\n\nThis process continues until the equipment is fully depreciated. Depreciation helps to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life, reflecting its declining value on the balance sheet."

            "### Depreciation vs. Accelerated Depreciation\n\n**Depreciation** is the process of spreading out the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. This allocation can be done using various methods, with the most common being the straight-line method, where the expense is evenly spread over the asset's useful life.\n\n**Accelerated Depreciation** is a method that allocates a higher depreciation expense to the earlier years of the asset's life and lower expenses to the later years. This method recognizes that assets often lose value more quickly when they are new.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n1. **Depreciation Expense Timing**:\n   - **Straight-Line Depreciation**: The expense is the same each year.\n   - **Accelerated Depreciation**: The expense is higher in the earlier years and lower in the later years.\n\n2. **Impact on Financial Statements**:\n   - **Straight-Line Depreciation**: Provides consistent expense reporting, leading to stable net income figures.\n   - **Accelerated Depreciation**: Results in higher expenses and lower net income in the early years, and lower expenses and higher net income in the later years.\n\n3. **Common Methods**:\n   - **Straight-Line Depreciation**: (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life.\n   - **Accelerated Depreciation**: Methods include Double Declining Balance (DDB) and Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits (SYD).\n\n### Example and Balance Sheet Illustration\n\n#### Equipment Purchase Details\n- Cost: $10,000\n- Useful Life: 5 years\n- Residual Value: $0\n\n#### Straight-Line Depreciation\n\n- Annual Depreciation Expense: $2,000 ($10,000 / 5 years)\n\n##### End of Year 1 (Straight-Line)\n\n| **Balance Sheet**          | **Amount** |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| **Assets**                 |            |\n| Cash                       | $10,000    |\n| Equipment                  | $10,000    |\n| Accumulated Depreciation   | -$2,000    |\n| **Net Equipment Value**    | $8,000     |\n| **Total Assets**           | $18,000    |\n| **Liabilities and Equity** |            |\n| Equity                     | $18,000    |\n| **Total Liabilities and Equity** | $18,000    |\n\n#### Accelerated Depreciation (Double Declining Balance Method)\n\n- First Year Depreciation: 40% of $10,000 = $4,000\n- Second Year Depreciation: 40% of $6,000 = $2,400\n\n##### End of Year 1 (Accelerated Depreciation)\n\n| **Balance Sheet**          | **Amount** |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| **Assets**                 |            |\n| Cash                       | $10,000    |\n| Equipment                  | $10,000    |\n| Accumulated Depreciation   | -$4,000    |\n| **Net Equipment Value**    | $6,000     |\n| **Total Assets**           | $16,000    |\n| **Liabilities and Equity** |            |\n| Equity                     | $16,000    |\n| **Total Liabilities and Equity** | $16,000    |\n\n##### End of Year 2 (Accelerated Depreciation)\n\n| **Balance Sheet**          | **Amount** |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| **Assets**                 |            |\n| Cash                       | $10,000    |\n| Equipment                  | $10,000    |\n| Accumulated Depreciation   | -$6,400    |\n| **Net Equipment Value**    | $3,600     |\n| **Total Assets**           | $13,600    |\n| **Liabilities and Equity** |            |\n| Equity                     | $13,600    |\n| **Total Liabilities and Equity** | $13,600    |\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Straight-Line Depreciation**: The equipment value decreases uniformly each year. This results in consistent depreciation expense and steady financial reporting.\n- **Accelerated Depreciation**: The equipment value decreases rapidly in the early years, leading to a larger depreciation expense initially and lower net income. This can be beneficial for tax purposes as it allows businesses to defer taxes by reducing taxable income in the early years of an asset's life.\n\nAccelerated depreciation methods can better match the actual usage pattern and wear of an asset, providing a more realistic view of its declining value over time."
