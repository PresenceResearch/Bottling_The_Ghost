          "text": "\nThe main appeal of Amazon Prints among other photo printing shops is convenience – many people already have an account on Amazon for other services, so you don’t have to create more accounts and manage your data elsewhere.\n\nIf you already have a lot of images stored in Amazon Photos, using their online printing service is a no-brainer.\n\n### 4. Artifact Uprising\n\n[Image 24: Ordering photo prints from Artifact Uprising][Image 25: Ordering photo prints from Artifact Uprising]\n\nPros\n\n  * Fast processing time\n  * International shipping\n  * High-quality products\n\nCons\n\n  * No free shipping\n  * Higher than average prices\n\n【27†learn more†shareasale.com】\n\nWhile the photo printing is good and varied, I feel like the real perk of this small company is all the related products.\n\n> 【27†Artifact Uprising†shareasale.com】 offers a huge number of gorgeous-looking photo books and album choices – plus design services so you can have an expert create the album with your vision.\n\nThe gifts are categorized by theme and occasion, which makes them easier to navigate.\n\nFor example, there’s a wedding section with everything you need (print-wise) to organize your wedding – from save-the-date notes to the table numbers.\n\nThe standard size photo prints are not sold individually. Instead, you’ll find them as sets starting from US$9 and ranging up to US$60 according to the size and amount of pictures.\n\nYou can’t see the final price unless you log in and simulate the purchase, which can be a turn-off, but with regular use, you quickly get an idea of what the final cost will be.\n\nThe interface to upload images and design your products is very straightforward. It’s easy to use but it doesn’t give much leeway to your creativity – a compromise made in exchange for an elegant and minimal design that’s curated in every detail.\n\nShotkit’s founder Mark has ordered several photo books from Artifact in the past, and loves the look and feel of them – more of an artisinal-style product than some of the budget online photo printing services out there.\n\nThey’re definitely pricier than alternatives, and shipping outside the US quickly adds up, but you’re left with high quality prints with great color accuracy from a photo lab you can trust.\n\n### 5. Mixbook\n\n[Image 26: Mixbook Photo Co. website interface][Image 27: Mixbook Photo Co. website interface]\n\nPros\n\n  * International shipping\n  * Easy to use, customizable templates\n  * Good quality\n  * Fast turnover\n\nCons\n\n  * No standard size prints\n  * No free shipping\n\n【28†learn more†imp.i310051.net】\n\nMixbook offers a wide variety of prints and products, although you won’t find the normal standard size print. Single prints are available in larger sizes or different materials (such as metallic print and canvas print).\n\nOther products include photo books, calendars, cards and magnets. To create them, you’ll find many easy-to-use and widely customizable templates to make the process fun and creative.\n\n> The image quality and customer services of 【28†Mixbook†imp.i310051.net】 are highly ranked in Trustpilot with a vote of 4.8/5, where 84% qualify it as excellent and 10% as great.\n\nMixbook offers four shipping options worldwide – free shipping is not available by default, although you might run into promo codes every now and then to get a discount and/or free shipping.\n\nThe processing time is three or four days depending on the product. If you’re a business, you can benefit from their bulk order prices and policies – you just have to fill a bulk discount request form.\n\nMixbook regularly runs promotions on its site (see the image above, for example), making them one of the more affordable online photo printing services available to photographers in 2024.\n\nIt’s also a great 【29†place for artists to get prints online.】\n\n### 6. Mpix\n\n[Image 28: Mpix benefits and features for photo printing][Image 29: Mpix benefits and features for photo printing]\n\nPros\n\n  * Affordable prices\n  * Wide variety\n  * Free shipping on orders $35+\n  * Upscale to boutique packaging available\n  * Basic photo retouching is available\n\nCons\n\n  * Only ships in the US\n\n【30†learn more†www.mpix.com】\n\nOne of the things that differentiates Mpix from lesser online photo printing services is the high quality and care they take with their photo prints. They offer professional photo printing services for those who want the best quality results.\n\n> Mpix offers a wide variety of photographic products, including some gift ideas that are not as easy to find with its competitors, such as dog tags or statuettes.\n\nSpeaking of gifts, you can upscale your order to boutique packaging to send any of the products as a present to your loved ones or delivered as a final product to your customers.\n\nAmongst the services offered by Mpix, you’ll also find some basic photo-retouching such as 【31†teeth whitening】, red-eye reduction, skin retouching, color correction etc.\n\nThere are also custom framing options or the possibility to mount and print on canvas, which they advertise as being “hand made in the heartland” – it’s nice to see online photo printing services employing locally.\n\nThe Mpix interface is very intuitive and easy to use. You can upload photos from your computer or online platforms such as Facebook.\n\nIt has a quick turnaround, and you can choose from four delivery options with the high-quality prints arriving on your doorstep ready to be added to albums or framed yourself.\n\n### 7. Shutterfly\n\n[Image 30: Shutterfly offers prints, canvas prints, gifts and more][Image 31: Shutterfly offers prints, canvas prints, gifts and more]\n\nPros\n\n  * Free unlimited storage\n  * International shipping\n  * Wide variety of products\n",

Moving into the weekend, conditions will become more settled as high pressure builds in from the west. A few showers could still develop, particularly in the north, but for many it will become increasingly dry with spells of sunshine. For the week that follows, there are no particularly strong signals for a particular type of weather to dominate. Overall, the south of the UK will probably be drier, with focus for showers or rainfall tending to be across the north. Temperatures will probably be around normal or a little above for the time of year.\n\nUpdated: 15:0",

            "I think having a few days of rain and thunderstorms at the start of the week isn't ideal, especially if you have outdoor plans for Memorial Day. However, it's great to see that the weather will clear up by mid-week, giving way to sunny and pleasant conditions. This could be a good opportunity to enjoy some outdoor activities later in the week. Just make sure to plan around the rainy start and perhaps have some indoor activities ready for Sunday and Monday. How do you feel about the upcoming weather? Any specific plans you have in mind?"
