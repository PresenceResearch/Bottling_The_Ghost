          "text": "\n3rd July 2021 \n\n1 \n\nVote score\n\nStrange indeed, considering his 2nd #1 isn't on the list? (I don't see it, only Fast Love at 25). Both Prodigy #1s are higher than that. And the classic case of getting banned on TV for Channel 4 to show the video. Special year for me - the first year I started collecting music and listened to the chart every week. Spice Girls started my collection with my own money (earlier ones were from parents or presents).\n\n[Image 6: avatar]\n\n#### Velvet Android \n\n7th July 2021 \n\n1 \n\nVote score\n\nYes, my immediate thought was \"Wait a minute, was his Number One hit Jesus To A Child really outsold across 1996 by Hillbilly Rock Hillbilly Roll?\" I mean, I know it topped the chart near the start of the year when overall sales are always lower, but even so... To quote OMC (another who outsold it, indeed), how bizarre.\n\n[Image 7: avatar]\n\n#### Velvet Android \n\n7th July 2021 \n\n0 \n\nVote score\n\nRandom observation, re the Woolpackers, OMC, etc: there were four No.3 hits on the year-end list, and only two No.4s – yet no fewer than six No.5 hits made it in, including both of those songs.\n\n[Image 8: avatar]\n\n#### Blank \n\n8th July 2021 \n\n0 \n\nVote score\n\nI remember many of those #5s sticking around for months!  \nDon't be surprised to see Gala Freed From Desire above some of the #1s in 1997's chart, but 1997 saw an unusually high amount of million sellers. Including a VERY big hit ;-)\n\n[Image 9: avatar]\n\n#### Velvet Android \n\n9th July 2021 \n\n0 \n\nVote score\n\nYou're thinking of that epochal musical goalpost-shifter and all-round cultural touchstone from a piece of \"event TV\" that gripped the nation, aren't you? By which I mean Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh, if course.\n\n[Image 10: avatar]\n\n#### Blank \n\n11th July 2021 \n\n0 \n\nVote score\n\nIn a normal year, Teletubbies (seliing a million) would be considered a big hit. I meant Candle In The Wind, but I suspect you knew that. Remember the day well. It wasn't a good one - they took the chart show off the radio!  \nAnd that was in the days before you could look it up online the next day. Even Teletext didn't have it (only doing a top 10).\n\n[Image 11: avatar]\n\n#### Velvet Android \n\n12th July 2021 \n\n0 \n\nVote score\n\nHah, yes the ambiguity was deliberate but I was being facetious, in case it wasn't entirely clear...\n\nI'd forgotten about that Top 10 only on Teletext! I'd forgotten also about the chart show not being broadcast that day. What did they do instead?\n\n[Image 12: avatar]\n\n#### Blank \n\n12th July 2021 \n\n0 \n\nVote score\n\nJust play tributes and news articles about Diana on every radio and TV station available for the whole day. It was unbearable. Particularly as I'd already heard about the crash and she was critical before I went to bed (hadn't died yet).\n\n[Image 13: avatar]\n\n#### Velvet Android \n\n13th July 2021 \n\n1 \n\nVote score\n\nSorry, I realise now I was unintentionally ambiguous in my phrasing there! I well remember the wall-to-wall coverage and nothing on the airwaves but a rotating playlist of suitably bland weepy music for a couple of days at least.\n\nWhat I meant though was what did they do about putting the chart out. Did that Top 40 never get aired on radio at all? Did we the public just have to work it out ourselves from going to find the printed chart stuck up in, say, Virgin Megastores? As an avid listener to Radio 1's chart show every week at the time I'm surprised I don't remember that little anomaly.\n\n[Image 14: avatar]\n\n#### Blank \n\n16th July 2021 \n\n1 \n\nVote score\n\nI'm not aware that they ever played the chart at all, let alone in full as scheduled. It was a pain. You could work out a lot of from the hits that stayed on chart and had \"last week\" positions published but those that spent their last or only week on chart that week would not be documented. I'm not even sure if papers published them as 1) I don't normally read papers anyway and 2) they were all full tributes too with no other stories in them at all from what I could see. Like radio, they were not doing their normal news.\n\nI don't remember when I first found out that top 40 (or 75). It may have been a retrospective on Launch (the predecessor to OCC which only had the current week's chart)- where James Masterson's commentry was published. Even then I'm not sure.\n\nSomething as simple as the current chart was hard to find online then. There was no legal archive. The ones there were, were not comprehensive covering every position of every week. e.g. Everyhit,com \n\nMusic Week probably published it as normal, but was a hard publication to simply buy off the shelf as it's a media journal more than a consumer magazine.\n\n[Image 15: avatar]\n\n#### Velvet Android \n\n17th July 2021 \n\n1 \n\nVote score\n\nAh thanks David, that's some interesting insight!\n\nLooking up the actual chart now, I realise why I was surprised – I was thinking that weekend was the one the Verve's The Drugs Don't Work hit #1, before being swept aside by Dianamania the next week, and I'm certain I",

The duo made up of Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt is back with their first album in 24 years. They talk about making choices that were best for them instead of chasing fame or money, including taking a long hiatus shortly after turning down a stadium tour with U2 in the 90s. \n\n“We had a feeling that our status as a band got about as big as we were comfortable with it being. Even our own gigs had got bigger. And in some respects, we felt something was lost as well as gained,” Tracey Thorn explains.  \n\nDuring Everything But The Girl’s long hiatus, Thorn and Watt got married, Thorn spent years being a stay at home Mom, she’s written multiple autobiographical books, published columns, and put out some solo records. Watt has worked as a DJ, producer, club owner, and runs his own record label. \n\n## More From Sound & Vision\n\n【38† 】  【38† Trans Musicales Highlights 】 \n\n##### 4/4/2024\n\nListen Now \n\nKEXP’s Morgan Chosnyk talks us through this year’s Trans Musicales festival in France and shares five of her favorite live sessions KEXP captured while at the … \n\n【39† 】  【39† Eurosonic Festival Highlights 】 \n\n##### 4/2/2024\n\nListen Now \n\nThe Eurosonic Festival features emerging artists from Europe.
