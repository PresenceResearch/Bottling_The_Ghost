          "text": "\n[Image 1: Solar Sales Representatives]\n\n## The Basics of Solar Sales & Salary Background \n\nThe vast majority of Solar Sales jobs focus on Residential Sales.  While the past year has seen a slowdown in hiring due primarily to the NEM 3.0 changes in California, there are still thousands of jobs across the country and we expect the residential market to rebound in the next couple of years.  Take a look at the latest Solar Sales opportunities on our 【12†Job Board†jobs.workinsolar.com】.\n\nResidential and Commercial Solar Sales cater to distinctly different markets with unique needs and challenges.  Residential solar sales focus on individual homeowners, offering solutions tailored to household energy consumption and rooftop specifications. The sales process often involves educating homeowners about the benefits of solar energy, including cost savings and environmental impact. In contrast, commercial solar sales target businesses, industrial clients, or large-scale projects, requiring a deeper understanding of complex energy needs, higher power demands, and often more intricate installation logistics. Here, the sales approach hinges on much more detailed financial analyses, long-term energy savings projections, and the integration of solar solutions into broader business operations and sustainability goals. Both sectors are integral to the solar industry's growth but require different sales strategies and expertise.  For more detail, check out our 【13†Solar Sales Career Page.】\n\nAs we outlined in a recent 【14†blog】, most entry-level jobs will focus on residential.  You’ll likely need industry and Sales experience to secure a Commercial Solar Sales jobs.  It is a common path to bridge from Residential to Commercial Solar Sales after gaining a few years of experience on the job.  \n\nOne key difference to contextualize the difference between Residential and Commercial is that Residential reps will be focused on closing high-volume and lower-dollar deals.  Commercial Sales Reps will invest much more in customer development, understanding their intricate needs to craft a unique proposal.  \n\n## Types of Compensation in Solar Sales \n\nSolar Sales compensation is not standardized today.  The structure will vary by company, so it is important to create a model to better understand how much you could be paid for any job offer you are considering.  Below, we’ll outline how compensation varies by a few of the different roles. \n\n### Solar Lead Generators / Canvassers Compensation \n\nThese roles are responsible for getting appointments/meetings on the calendar for more senior sales reps to “close” the deal. Base solar sales salaries are usually very low for these roles (approximately around minimum wage).\n\n  * Base Salary \n\n    * $30,000 per year \n\n  * Base Salary + Fixed Commision per meeting booked\n\n    * $20,000 per year + $100 per meeting \n\n  * Base Salary + Fixed Commision per meeting booked that leads to a close sale\n\n    * $20,000 per year + $250 per closed sale that came from one of your initial meetings \n\n  * Base Salary + % of Project Size\n\n    * $20,000 per year + 1% of any closed sale that came from one of your initial meetings (avg. residential installation is $20,000, so 2% would be $200)\n\nThese roles may often have “accelerators.” If you book more than X meetings per month, you may get paid more per additional meeting.  For example, if your quota is 100 meetings, you may get $100 per meeting for those first 100 meetings, but then get compensated $150 per meeting thereafter.  Note that these have to be quality meetings (i.e. the prospect is a good fit for purchasing solar panels), which is why many employers don’t pay you until a deal is closed.  While you may get a short-term bump in compensation from booking meetings that are lower quality, you can be sure that it will affect your medium-term compensation and your reputation at the employer.  Keep in mind that Solar should be a win-win-win for you, the customer, and your employer.  \n\n### Residential Solar Sales Reps Compensation \n\nThese roles are the deal “closers.” You will help assess if the customer is a good fit, plan the installation, work through the paperwork, and ensure the installation process is a success with the client.  Again, compensation is not standardized, so make sure you do your diligence before accepting an offer.\n\n  * Base Salary + Fixed Commission per Sale\n\n    * $40,000 + $1,000 per sale \n\n  * Base Salary + % Commission of Sales Price\n\n    * $40,000 + 10% of sales (avg. residential installation is ~$20,000, so 10% would be $2,000)\n\n    * Note that the % commission is variable.  We’ve seen on the low end 3%-4% commission, but commission can be up to ~10%\n\n  * Base Salary + $ per KW installed \n\n    * This is similar to a % of commission, but it is tied to power installed.  The average power installed is 6-8 kW, so you may earn $200-$400 per kW installed.\n\n    * $40,000 + $300 per kW ($2,100 for a 7kW installation)\n\n  * No Base Salary + any of the above commission structures \n\n    * Some employers may not offer any base salary, but compensate you purely based on your performance.  You should expect to see higher commission amounts or %s for these types of roles \n\nLike Canvassers, these roles may also have accelerators to encourage you to go above and beyond.  You may earn 10% commission on your first 10 deals in the month, but then earn 12% for any deal thereafter \n\n### Commercial Solar Sales Reps Compensation \n\nCommercial Sales Reps will have similar compensation structures to Residential Reps listed above.  You will typically see compensation tied to the size of the project (kWs or $s), as Fixed Commission is very unlikely",

            "Based on market data, here's a proposed at-risk pay compensation plan for your two commercial solar salespeople. The compensation will include a base salary, commission, and potential bonuses tied to their performance.\n\n### Compensation Structure\n\n#### Base Salary\n- Each salesperson currently has a base salary of $40,000 per year, which aligns with the lower end of the typical range for commercial solar sales representatives. To stay competitive, you might consider increasing this to match the market average.\n- Market data suggests that the average base salary for commercial solar sales reps ranges from $89,403 to $120,176, with a median of around $103,628【9†source】【8†source】.\n\n#### Commission\n- **Fixed Commission per Sale**: Offer a fixed commission for each sale. For instance, $1,000 per sale.\n- **Percentage of Sales Price**: Alternatively, you can structure the commission as a percentage of the sales price. A common range is 3% to 10% of the sales price, depending on the complexity and size of the deals【8†source】.\n- **Commission per kW Installed**: Another option is to tie the commission to the amount of power installed. For example, $300 per kW installed, which aligns with an average installation size of around 7 kW【8†source】.\n\n#### Accelerators\n- Implement accelerator clauses to incentivize overperformance. For example, if the salesperson exceeds their monthly or quarterly sales targets, they could earn a higher commission rate on those additional sales (e.g., 12% instead of 10% for sales beyond a certain threshold)【8†source】.\n\n#### Bonuses\n- **Performance Bonuses**: Introduce performance bonuses for meeting or exceeding annual sales goals. For instance, if a salesperson meets the $5,000,000 annual target, they receive a bonus of $10,000. If they exceed it by a certain percentage, the bonus could increase accordingly.\n- **Team Performance Bonus**: Since you also sell, consider a team performance bonus that rewards the entire team if the collective sales goals are met or exceeded.\n\n### Example Compensation Plan\n\n1. **Base Salary**: $60,000 per year\n2. **Commission**:\n   - 5% of the sales price for each deal closed.\n   - An additional $500 per sale if they exceed quarterly targets by 10%.\n3. **Bonuses**:\n   - $10,000 for meeting the annual sales target of $5,000,000.\n   - Additional $5,000 for every 10% over the annual target.\n\nThis plan ensures your salespeople are motivated to not only meet their goals but also exceed them, driving overall company growth. Adjust the base salary and commission rates to align with your company's budget and strategic goals.\n\nIf you need further customization or additional details, feel free to ask!"

            "To create sales goals where each sales rep makes $300,000 per year and you, as the sales manager, make $400,000 per year without adjusting the base salaries, we need to determine the necessary commission and override structures based on the provided information.\n\n### Sales Representative Compensation Calculation\n1. **Base Salary**: $60,000\n2. **Target Total Compensation**: $300,000\n3. **Required Commission**: $300,000 - $60,000 = $240,000\n\nTo achieve $240,000 in commissions:\n\n#### Sales Representatives\n- **Assumption**: The commission rate is 5%, and we need to consider the margin adjustments.\n- **Required Sales with Base Commission**:\n  - Base Commission Rate: 5%\n  - Commission Needed: $240,000\n  - Required Sales: $240,000 / 0.05 = $4,800,000\n\nWith margin adjustments, the gross margin might influence the total earnings, but for simplicity, let's use the base commission to set the target.\n\n### Sales Manager Compensation Calculation\n1. **Base Salary**: $120,000\n2. **Target Total Compensation**: $400,000\n3. **Required Commission and Override**: $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000\n\nTo achieve $280,000 in commissions and overrides:\n\n#### Sales Manager\n- **Personal Sales Goal**: $2,500,000 (as adjusted previously)\n- **Personal Commission**:\n  - Base Commission Rate: 5%\n  - Personal Sales: $2,500,000\n  - Commission from Personal Sales: $2,500,000 * 5% = $125,000\n- **Required Override**: $280,000 - $125,000 = $155,000\n\n#### Override Calculation\n- **Override Rate**: 3% (as increased for higher involvement)\n- **Required Sales for Override**: $155,000 / 0.03 = $5,166,667 (total sales by reps)\n\nSince each sales rep needs to sell around $5,000,000 to achieve their target compensation, the overall team target aligns with these figures.\n\n### Summary of Sales Goals\n#### Sales Representatives\n- **Base Salary**: $60,000\n- **Commission**: 5% of sales\n- **Sales Goal**: $5,000,000 annually\n- **Total Compensation**: Base Salary ($60,000) + Commission ($240,000) = $300,000\n\n#### Sales Manager\n- **Base Salary**: $120,000\n- **Personal Sales Goal**: $2,500,000 annually\n- **Personal Commission**: 5% of personal sales = $125,000\n- **Override**: 3% of team sales\n- **Team Sales Goal**: Each rep $5,000,000, total $10,000,000\n- **Override from Team Sales**: 3% of $10,000,000 = $300,000\n- **Total Compensation**: Base Salary ($120,000) + Personal Commission ($125,000) + Override ($300,000) = $545,000\n\nThe total compensation for the sales manager exceeds $400,000 in this scenario, providing a buffer for variations in actual performance.\n\n### Final Adjusted Goals to Meet Exact Compensation\nTo fine-tune to exact targets:\n- **Sales Representatives**:\n  - Maintain $5,000,000 sales goal for slightly higher total compensation (~$300,000).\n\n- **Sales Manager**:\n  - Adjust override or personal sales contribution to meet the exact $400,000.\n\nFor exact matching:\n- Sales Manager might reduce personal goal slightly or accept the overachievement in compensation.\n\nThis structure ensures competitive pay while aligning incentives with company goals. If adjustments are needed, the override rate or exact sales targets can be fine-tuned further."
