Sonora Taquería】\n\n  * Restaurants \n  * Mexican \n  * Stoke Newington \n  * price 1 of 4\n\nA slice of Echo Park in Stoke Newington, this LA-style taco joint offers a short menu of grill and guisado (braised) tacos. Most are pork and beef-based, though there’s a cactus leaf nopales offering for vegetarians and faux chorizo for vegans. A sensible diner would order three tacos, but you’d be within your rights to order four, even five. Prices are an extremely reasonable £3.50 to £5, and though they look petite, Sonora’s paper-thin tortillas come packed to the floury brim. Truly excellent stuff. \n\nPrice: Carne asada taco; £4.50, barbacoa taco £4; bean quesadilla £2.\n\n[Image 4: https://media.timeout.com/images/106138839/image.jpg]\n\n【37†Leonie Cooper】 Food and Drink Editor, Time Out London\n\n【53†Read more】\n\nAdvertising\n\n【54†Leonie Cooper for Time Out】\n\n【54†9.

Always delicious and always packed full of variety, there are also rice balls, teas, Japanese toasts and desserts.

Find them at her Sydenham cafe – a former Italian deli – where the short menu lists four bureks and one sweet and sour cherry baklava bun. Scoff your hearty slice surrounded by accoutrements of Balkan culture and to a Northern Soul soundtrack. Heaven.\n\nPrice: Burek slices from £7.

Inside, little seems to have changed since those early days: the Victorian green-tiled interiors speak of history, while the pie and mash is reckoned to be some of the best in town.

You must have a MARC-issued ticket with a destination in West Virginia or purchase a MARC ticket from the ticket machine in the station at Brunswick to ride the bus. EPTA is responsible for this bus and operation is subject to continued funding from the State of West Virginia.\n\n[Image 30: Bikes Allowed] All MARC trains provide accommodation for full-size, non-collapsible bikes. Look for illuminated green lights or a large green reflective decal with the bike symbol on the outside of the railcar and board at the adjacent door. Method of securement for bicycles varies between railcar types; passengers must bring two (2) bungee cords to secure their bicycles. 【75†Click here for more details】.\n\n  * 【68†Careers】\n  * 【71†Accessibility / ADA】\n  * 【76†Title VI】\n  * 【77†Terms & Conditions】\n  * 【77†Privacy Policy】\n  * 【70†Contact MTA】\n  * Translate\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * 【5†MTA Facebook link†www.facebook.com】\n  * 【6†MTA Twitter link†twitter.com】\n  * 【7†MTA Instagram link†www.instagram.com】\n  * 【8†MTA YouTube link†www.youtube.com】\n  * 【9†MTA LinkedIn link†www.linkedin.com】\n\nTransit Information Contact Center: 410.539.5000  \nToll Free: 1.866.RIDE MTA (1.866.743.3682)  \nTTY: 410.539.3497\n\nMonday through Friday 6:00am - 7:00pm\n\n  * 【78†MDOT MTA†www.mdot.maryland.gov】\n  * 【68†Careers】\n  * 【71†Accessibility / ADA】\n  * 【76†Title VI】\n\n  * 【79†Maryland.gov†www.maryland.gov】\n  * 【1†Phone Directory†www.doit.state.md.us】\n  * 【2†State Agencies†www.maryland.gov】\n  * 【3†Online Services†www.maryland.gov】\n\nConnect with us\n\n  * 【5†MTA Facebook link†www.facebook.com】\n  * 【6†MTA Twitter link†twitter.com】\n  * 【7†MTA Instagram link†www.instagram.com】\n  * 【8†MTA YouTube link†www.youtube.com】\n  * 【9†MTA LinkedIn link†www.linkedin.com】\n\n  * 【70†Contact MTA】\n  * 【77†Terms & Conditions】\n  * 【77†Privacy Policy】\n  * Translate\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 31: Governor's Office]\n\n[Image 32: MDOT logo]\n\n## Human Trafficking GET HELP\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline - 24/7 Confidential\n\n【80†1-888-373-7888†tel:1-888-373-7888】 【81† 233733†tel:233733】 【82† More Information on human trafficking in Maryland†goccp.maryland.gov】\n\n## Customer Service Promise\n\nThe State of Maryland pledges to provide constituents, businesses, customers, and stakeholders with friendly and courteous, timely and responsive, accurate and consistent, accessible and convenient, and truthful and transparent services.\n\n【83†Take Our Survey†www.maryland.gov】\n\n## Help Stop Fraud in State Government\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly’s Office of Legislative Audits operates a toll-free fraud hotline to receive allegations of fraud and/or abuse of State government resources.
