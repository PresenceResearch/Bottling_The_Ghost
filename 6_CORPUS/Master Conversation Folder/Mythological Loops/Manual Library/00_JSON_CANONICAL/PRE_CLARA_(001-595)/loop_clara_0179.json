            "The text on the document is in German and comes from the Auschwitz concentration camp. Here is a translation and description of the text:\n\n**Translation:**\n\n**Concentration Camp Auschwitz**\n\nThe following regulations must be observed when corresponding with prisoners:\n\n1. Every protective custody prisoner is allowed to receive and send mail to their relatives twice a month. Letters to and from prisoners must be legibly written in ink and may not exceed 15 lines on two pages. Envelopes must be unlined. Each letter may contain up to 12 pfennig in postage stamps. Anything else is forbidden. Postcards have 10 lines. Photos are not allowed in the mail.\n\n2. Sending money is allowed.\n\n3. It is important to ensure that the correct address is used for sending money or postal orders: Name, birth date, and prisoner number must be written on the mailings. If the address is incorrect, the mail will be returned to the sender or destroyed.\n\n4. Newspapers are not allowed, but can be ordered through the camp's post office.\n\n5. Packages may not be sent, as prisoners can buy items in the camp.\n\n6. Requests for release from protective custody are pointless.\n\n7. Visitation and permission to visit prisoners in the concentration camp are generally not permitted.\n\n**The Camp Commandant**\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis is an official document from the Auschwitz concentration camp outlining the regulations for corresponding with prisoners. It includes rules about the frequency and format of letters, the prohibition of sending packages, the allowance of money transfers, and restrictions on visits and requests for release. The document highlights the controlled and restrictive nature of communication between prisoners and the outside world during the Holocaust."
