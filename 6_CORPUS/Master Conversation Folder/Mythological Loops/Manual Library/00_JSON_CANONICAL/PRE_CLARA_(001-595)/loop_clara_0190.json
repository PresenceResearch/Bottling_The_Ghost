Admission will remain free to all guests.\n\n“Baltimore’s roster of annual festivals has changed a lot since the pandemic, but we’re proud that WTMD’s First Thursdays will continue presenting diverse music lineups and amplifying our community,” said Craig Swagler, President and General Manager of Your Public Radio Corp., which owns WTMD. “We can’t wait to welcome thousands of Baltimoreans to enjoy free music by the harbor and showcase some of the city’s many local food and craft vendors.” \n\nThe First Thursday Festival series drew its largest-ever audience in June 2023, with an estimated 12,000 people in attendance. The 2023 First Thursday season also set a new record with nearly 100 locally based vendors and artisans, including a new Baker Artist Alley, showcasing works by members of the 【22†Baker Artist Portfolio†bakerartist.org】.\n\n“First Thursdays is our love letter to Baltimore,” said Sam Sessa, WTMD’s Director of Events. “Despite the challenges of rising costs, last season was a smashing success, and we’re thrilled to help bring this series back to the city this summer.”\n\nFounded two decades ago in Mt. Vernon Place, First Thursdays moved to Canton Waterfront Park in 2014 and has featured free performances by established indie artists such as Los Lonely Boys, Joan Osborne and Lake Street Dive, as well as rising stars the Black Pumas, Waxahatchee and many others. \n\nWTMD’s 2024 First Thursday Festival series is made possible with support from Baltimore City Rec & Parks, CFG Bank, McCormick, Breakthru Beverage, Chesapeake Beverage and other unique and local businesses such as Ekiben and Fuzzie’s Burgers. More information about the concert series will be updated in the coming months online at 【23†wtmd.org/firstthursdays】.\n\n[Image 2]\n\n### Related Posts\n\n[Image 3: Friday, June 7]\n\n####  【24† Friday, June 7 】\n\n[Image 4: Week of June 3]\n\n####  【25† Week of June 3 】\n\n[Image 5: June 7 – 9]\n\n####  【26† June 7 – 9 】\n\n[Image 6: Week of May 27]\n\n####  【27† Week of May 27 】\n\n[Image 7: Friday, May 31]\n\n####  【28† Friday, May 31 】\n\nWTMD is sponsored by\n\nWTMD is sponsored by\n\nWTMD is sponsored by\n\nShare This Page\n\n#### ARCHIVES\n\n  * 【29†Artist Interviews】\n\n  * 【30†Countdowns】\n\n#### OUR PARTNERS\n\n  * 【31†National Public Radio†npr.org】\n\n  * 【32†Support Independent Baltimore Businesses】\n\n【33†Sign up for TMD e-news!†wtmd.us1.list-manage.com】\n\n#### Get the WTMD App!\n\n[Image 8: Get the WTMD app on Google Play!]\n\n[Image 9: Get the TMD app in the App Store!]\n\n[Image 10: WTMD]\n\n[Image 11: Baltimore Public Media]\n\nWTMD 89.7 FM is a broadcast service of 【34†Baltimore Public Media†www.baltimorepublicmedia.org】, a 501(c)(3) that also operates WYPR 88.1 FM.  \nWe are governed by a local board of directors and advised by a Community Advisory Board.
