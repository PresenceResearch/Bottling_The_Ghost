          "text": "\nA tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of federal taxes owed. The ITC lets you reduce your federal taxes by an amount equal to a certain percentage of your cost to purchase a solar system. Homeowners and businesses are eligible for the ITC only if they own the solar system. Owners of solar projects that are completed from 2022 through 2032 are eligible to deduct from their federal taxes 30% of the cost of their solar project. That percentage drops to 26% in 2033, then 22% in 2034, and disappears in 2035. So if you purchased a solar project that cost $25,000 and was installed on your house or business in 2022, you can deduct 30% of that, or $7,500, from your 2022 federal taxes. If your total federal tax owed is less than $7,500, your federal taxes would be $0 and the rest would carry forward to a later tax year.\n\nThe following solar costs are covered by the ITC:\n\n  * Solar panel cost\n  * Labor cost including installation, permitting fees, inspection fees, and developer fees\n  * All other solar equipment costs (including batteries charged by solar)\n  * Sales taxes on eligible equipment\n\nThe above information is not professional tax advice or guidance. For information on how to claim the ITC and how it applies to your specific situation we recommend contacting a tax professional.\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act:\n\nLearn how the Inflation Reduction Act can help homeowners, businesses or manufacturers in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office resources.\n\n【33†Homeowners Guide to Federal Tax Credit for Solar Photovoltaics †www.energy.gov】\n\n【34†Federal Solar Tax Credit for Businesses†www.energy.gov】\n\n【35†Federal Solar Tax Credit for Manufacturers†www.energy.gov】\n\n## Financing:\n\nFinancing for solar systems is available through Energize Delaware’s programs for residents, businesses and nonprofits.\n\n  * Energize Delaware Residential Solar Loan Program: The Energize Delaware Solar Loan program, administered by the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility, offers a low interest solar loan designed to encourage the purchase of customer sited and owned solar systems. The loan amount for the program ranges from $5,000-$30,000, with the total loan amount not exceeding 70% of the total project cost. The term of the loan is 10 years, and the interest rate is 3.9%.

The program allows commercial entities to secure financing to make sustainable improvements to their properties, including the installation of a solar system. The financing is provided by capital providers in an open market, which provides property owners with competitive, private financing. Because the long-term financing can cover up to 100 percent of a building’s modernization project cost and often requires no money down, C-PACE enables property owners to make substantial upgrades to their buildings.

One SREC is generated for every megawatt hour (MWh), or 1,000 kilowatt hours (kWh), of electricity generated by a solar system. SRECs represent the “green” and renewable value of the electricity generated by a solar system. It is important to note that SRECs are sold separately from the electricity a system produces.\n\nThe value of an SREC is determined by the market subject to supply and demand constraints. SRECs can be sold to electricity suppliers needing to meet their solar RPS requirement.\n\nThe DESEU supports the RPS standard and therefore supports the SREC market with programs.\n\n## Annual SREC Procurement Program\n\nIn 2011, the Delaware legislature amended the solar portion of the state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to switch the burden of acquiring SRECs away from the power providers to the electric distribution companies in Delaware. This amendment drastically reduced the number of buyer participants, effectively making Delmarva Power, the largest electric distribution utility in Delaware, the de-facto long term buyer for the majority of the DE SREC requirement. In response, Delmarva Power proposed the implementation of an SREC procurement program, called the SREC Delaware Procurement Program that provides long-term contracts to SREC sellers on a competitive basis.\n\nDelmarva, which has selected the DESEU to operate the program, plans to run at least one solicitation each year in order to fulfill its long-term SREC needs.\n\nThe SREC Delaware Program holds an annual procurement for customers who what to participate in the Program. Each procurement is unique and divides solar properties into tiers based on their attributes, such as system size, interconnection date, and ownership type. Each procurement is bid-based — meaning that the lowest bids are accepted in each tier.\n\nDuring each procurement there is a two-week window when applicants can submit bids. Each bid includes information about the system, and the price that the applicant would be willing to accept per SREC. At the end of the two-week window, the Program Administrator verifies that each bid is valid. All valid bids are ordered from lowest price to highest price, and the lowest price bids are accepted until the given tier is full. Winning bids are awarded a multi-year contract to sell their SRECs under the program.\n\nSolar properties that have been built with either Delaware labor or Delaware manufactured parts may be granted an SREC bonus of 10% for each qualification. For example, a property that qualifies as having been built with Delaware labor may be granted the equivalent of 10% SREC bonus for every SREC produced. A property that is certified as having been built with both DE parts and labor is qualified for a 20% bonus for every SREC produced, etc. The Delaware Public Service Commission will certify that a property meets the qualifications for each bonus.\n\n【33†Learn More†www.srecdelaware.com】 \n\nHere is a 【34†guide】 from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) with some considerations when installing solar panels in Delaware.\n\nShould you have any questions you may contact Drew Slater at 302-883-3038 or at Drew.Slater@deseu.org.\n\n## Residential\n\n### ENERGIZE DELAWARE PROGRAMS\n\nMenu\n\n  * 【9†Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® for Homeowners】\n  * 【10†Assisted Home Performance with ENERGY STAR®】\n  * 【11†Home Energy-Efficiency Loan Program】\n  * 【13†Online Marketplace†energizedelawaremarketplace.com】\n  * 【12†Affordable Multifamily Housing】\n  * 【14†Home Energy Counseling and Check-up Program】\n  * 【15†ZeMod】\n  * 【16†Residential Solar Loans】\n  * 【17†Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)】\n  * 【18†EV Education and Resources†ev.energizedelaware.org】\n  * 【19†Find a Participating Contractor】\n  * 【20†Contractor Resources】\n  * 【35†Solar Delaware†solardelaware.org】\n\n### OTHER PROGRAMS\n\nMenu\n\n  * 【22†Green Energy Program】\n  * 【21†Weatherization Assistance】\n\n### RESOURCES\n\nMenu\n\n  * 【35†Solar Delaware†solardelaware.org】\n  * 【24†DE Energy Directory】\n  * 【25†Glossary】\n  * 【26†FAQs】\n\n## Nonresidential\n\n### Business\n\n### ENERGIZE DELAWARE PROGRAMS\n\nMenu\n\n  * 【36†Delaware Property Assessed Clean Energy (D-PACE) †www.delawarecpace.org】\n  * 【37†Low Interest Commercial Loan Program】\n ",

            "Delaware offers a variety of programs and incentives to support commercial solar installations. Here are some key programs available:\n\n1. **Green Energy Program**: This program is administered by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and offers grants to businesses and organizations to offset the installed costs of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Customers of Delmarva Power & Light, Delaware Electric Cooperative, and Delaware Municipal Electrical Corporation can apply for these grants【6†source】【7†source】.\n\n2. **Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)**: SRECs are credits generated by solar systems based on their electricity production. Businesses can sell these credits to electricity suppliers to meet the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. Delmarva Power runs an annual SREC procurement program to facilitate this process【9†source】【10†source】.\n\n3. **Delaware Property Assessed Clean Energy (D-PACE) Program**: This program provides long-term financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements. It allows commercial property owners to finance solar installations and repay the cost through a voluntary assessment on their property tax bill【8†source】【9†source】.\n\n4. **Low-Interest Commercial Loan Program**: Administered by Energize Delaware, this program offers loans ranging from $30,000 to $2,000,000 for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The program aims to make it easier for businesses to invest in solar energy by providing attractive terms and interest rates【7†source】【9†source】.\n\n5. **Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**: Businesses can also take advantage of the federal ITC, which allows them to deduct 30% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their federal taxes. This incentive is available for systems installed through 2032, with the percentage decreasing gradually after that【7†source】.\n\nThese programs collectively help reduce the upfront costs of solar installations, provide long-term financial benefits, and support Delaware’s goal of increasing renewable energy use.\n\nFor more detailed information and application processes, you can visit the [Energize Delaware website](https://www.energizedelaware.org) and the [Delaware Green Energy Program page](https://www.dnrec.delaware.gov)."

            "The Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SREC) program is a market-based instrument that provides financial incentives for the generation of renewable energy, particularly solar power. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the SREC program works:\n\n### How SRECs are Created\n1. **Generation**: When a solar energy system generates electricity, it produces SRECs based on the amount of electricity generated. Typically, one SREC is equivalent to one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity (1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh)).\n\n### SREC Markets and Sales\n2. **Market Value**: The value of an SREC is determined by market demand and supply, which can fluctuate. Prices can be influenced by state regulations, the overall demand for renewable energy, and the number of SRECs available in the market.\n3. **Trading**: SRECs can be sold or traded in an open market. System owners can sell their SRECs directly to utilities, brokers, or through SREC marketplaces. In some states, utilities are required to purchase a certain number of SRECs to comply with state renewable portfolio standards (RPS).\n\n### SREC Procurement Programs\n4. **Procurement Programs**: Some states or utilities run SREC procurement programs, where they purchase SRECs through competitive bidding processes. For example, in Delaware, Delmarva Power operates an annual SREC procurement program where they solicit bids from SREC sellers and award long-term contracts to the lowest bidders.\n\n### Compliance and Reporting\n5. **Compliance**: Utilities and energy suppliers use SRECs to meet the requirements set by the state’s RPS. RPS mandates that a certain percentage of the electricity sold by these entities must come from renewable sources. By purchasing SRECs, utilities can demonstrate compliance with these mandates.\n6. **Reporting**: Solar system owners or aggregators report the amount of electricity generated to a tracking system that issues SRECs based on verified production data.\n\n### Benefits for Solar System Owners\n7. **Revenue Stream**: Selling SRECs provides an additional revenue stream for solar system owners, helping to offset the initial cost of installing solar panels. This can significantly improve the return on investment for solar projects.\n8. **Encouraging Solar Adoption**: The financial incentive provided by SRECs encourages more individuals and businesses to invest in solar energy, contributing to the growth of renewable energy capacity.\n\n### Delaware Specifics\n- **Annual Procurement**: Delmarva Power, in collaboration with the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (DESEU), conducts an annual procurement program to purchase SRECs. Solar system owners submit bids, and the lowest bids are accepted until the procurement goals are met.\n- **SREC Bonuses**: In Delaware, additional bonuses can be awarded if the solar system uses Delaware-manufactured parts or is installed using Delaware labor.\n\nOverall, the SREC program is a key mechanism in promoting the adoption of solar energy by providing financial incentives to solar system owners, thereby supporting state renewable energy goals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

The Act allows utilities to meet their portfolio standards by buying renewable energy credits (RECs) and solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) from wind, solar and other renewable sources.\n\nThe Act requires that Delmarva Power submit an annual report to the Public Service Commission showing compliance with the renewable energy portfolio standards. Their 【111†2015/2016 report†depsc.delaware.gov】 is posted on the Public Service Commission website.\n\n### How to Sell Renewable Energy Credits\n\nSales of renewable energy credits are made under the 【105†Delaware Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SREC) Program†srecdelaware.com】. Each spring the SREC program releases an annual procurement program to accept bids for sales of credits.\n\nInstalled renewable energy systems must be certified by the 【112†Delaware Public Service Commission†depsc.delaware.gov】 (PSC) in order to sell renewable energy credits. Information on certification application, fees, and 【113†instructions for submission†depsc.delaware.gov】 can be found on the PSC’s 【114†Renewable Portfolio Standard and Green Power Products†depsc.delaware.gov】 page under the heading “RPS Forms.”\n\nOnce a system is certified, sellers set up accounts with the 【106†Generation Attribute Tracking System†www.pjm-eis.com】 (GATS) provided by PJM Environmental Information Services, Inc. This system is an online platform to connect renewable energy credit sellers and buyers and to track their transactions to help meet government standards.\n\nFor information about the current value of renewable energy credits or questions concerning how to trade your credits, please contact your installation contractor. There are links and resources on the PSC’s 【114†Renewable Portfolio Standards and Green Power Products†depsc.delaware.gov】 page.

Because we’re on-target to hit 25% by 2025, it makes good sense to establish new goals for our RPS program.”\n\nUnder SB 33, which passed the House 29-12, the percentage of renewable energy from solar photovoltaics also would nearly triple from a target of 3.5% by 2025 to 10% by 2035.\n\n“Climate change is the key issue of our time and we will be judged based on our collective action or inaction,” said Senator Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown, the lead sponsor of SB 31. “By taking proactive steps to raise our renewable portfolio standard, we can simultaneously reduce our carbon footprint, spur innovation and job growth, and position our state for an affordable, efficient clean energy future. I am proud that we managed to pass this legislation in short order this year and look forward to building on this progress throughout the 151st General Assembly.”\n\nThe bill also would settle a dispute over cost caps for renewable energy credits (RECs) by establishing a maximum price and alternative compliance payments, should the cost of these credits rise unexpectedly. This market-based mechanism would replace the existing cost cap provisions, aims to end ongoing litigation on the subject, and protects ratepayers.\n\nSB 33 now goes to Governor John Carney for his signature.\n\n###\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * 【24†Increasing Renewable Energy Portfolio Standands】\n, \n  * 【25†SB 33】\n, \n  * 【26†Senate Bill 33】\n, \n  * 【27†updating Delaware’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)】\n\n## Recent Updates\n\n* * *\n\nFilter by Category \n\n  *  Commentary and Analysis\n  *  Press Release\n  *  Select All\n\nMay 23 2024\n\n###  【28†House Passes Minor-Brown Bill to Expand Access to Reproductive Healthcare】 \n\nMay 23, 2024\n\n【4†Press Release】 \n\nDOVER: On Thursday, the House passed legislation that would further expand access to abortion care in Delaware by requiring insurance carriers to provide coverage for abortion-related services.

            "Delaware's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) has seen recent legislative changes aimed at significantly increasing the state's use of renewable energy. As of the latest updates, Delaware's RPS mandates that 40% of the state's electricity must come from renewable sources by 2035. This includes a specific target for solar energy, which must constitute 10% of the state's energy mix by the same year.\n\nThe most recent change was made with Senate Bill 33, signed into law by Governor John Carney. This legislation not only increases the overall renewable energy target but also aims to nearly triple the proportion of solar energy from 3.5% by 2025 to 10% by 2035. This ambitious goal is part of Delaware's broader strategy to combat climate change and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nAdditionally, the bill includes provisions to address cost caps for renewable energy credits (RECs) and solar renewable energy credits (SRECs). It establishes a market-based mechanism for alternative compliance payments to manage the cost of these credits, ensuring that ratepayers are protected from unexpected price increases.\n\nThese changes reflect Delaware's commitment to transitioning to clean energy sources and mitigating the impacts of climate change, particularly in a state that is highly vulnerable to sea-level rise【32†source】【33†source】【34†source】【35†source】.\n\nFor more detailed information about the RPS and its implications, you can visit the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) website."
