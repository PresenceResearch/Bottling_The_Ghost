            "In Baltimore County, commercial solar installations must adhere to specific setback requirements as part of the zoning and permitting process.\n\nFor ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, a clear area of at least 10 feet around the installation must be provided. Additionally, a gravel or other non-combustible base must be installed and maintained under and around the installation to mitigate fire hazards and ensure safety.\n\nFor roof-mounted systems, the setback requirements are designed to ensure firefighter access and ventilation opportunities. These include maintaining a minimum six-foot clear perimeter along the edge of the roof. If the building length on either axis is 250 feet or less, this perimeter can be reduced to a minimum of four feet.\n\nThese setback requirements are part of the broader zoning regulations and building codes that Baltimore County enforces to ensure the safety and effectiveness of solar installations. For detailed and up-to-date information, you can refer to the [Baltimore County Zoning Regulations](https://library.municode.com/md/baltimore_county/codes/zoning_regulations) and the [Solar Photovoltaic System Installations guidelines](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/permits/permitsreview/solarpv.html) on the Baltimore County Government website."

For tracking ASTGUs, the minimum height of the panel at its horizontal position shall be 10 feet above ground;\n  * Maximum Direct Sunlight Reduction Requirements. All ASTGUs must demonstrate that the maximum sunlight reduction from the panel shading on every square foot of land directly beneath, behind and in the areas adjacent to and within the ASTGU’s design shall not be more than 50% of baseline field conditions;\n  * Growing Season/Time of Day Considerations. The typical growing season shall be considered to be March through October, with sunlight hour conditions with maximum 50% sunlight reduction to be between 10AM and 5PM for March and October, and from 9AM to 6PM from April through September;\n  * Maximum Size. The maximum AC rated capacity of an ASTGU shall be two MW in the first two Capacity Blocks of each Distribution Company’s service territory. The Department, in consultation with MDAR, will make an evaluation as to whether or not this provision shall be adjusted in subsequent Capacity Blocks.”\n\nSolar policies can require or allow site-specific consultations, analyses, or conditions for solar project development.\n\nFor example,\n\n  * “To qualify as an Agricultural Solar Tariff Generation Unit, project applicants must submit documentation about the underlying agricultural land and characteristics of the proposed solar array, including the dual-use system type (ground-mounted racking, pole towers, tracking, etc.), the total gross acres of open farmland to be integrated with the project, the type of crops to be grown and harvested, animals to be grazed with herd sizes, and design drawings.”\n  * In addition, applicants must, in consultation with UMass Amherst agricultural extension services, document the crops to be grown and compatibility with the design of the agricultural solar system, and provide detailed reports annually to the Department of Energy Resources and the Department of Agricultural Resources regarding the productivity of the crops and herds after project implementation and throughout the SMART incentive period.\n\nAdditional References\n\n  1.

Our consultation has ranged from questions related to the acquisition of a property, investigation of damage to a building, or providing structural design services for a PV system installation.\n\nIn some cases, there is a design engineer involved but in many cases, there is not. Frequently, the owner, contractor, or developer does not fully understand the code requirements to ensure the existing structural framing is not compromised by the PV panel installation. Depending on the jurisdiction and current code edition adopted, there may not be specific structural code requirements currently listed. Even when a design professional or diligent contractor is involved, there may be confusion about who is responsible for which part of the structural design. In addition, there may be missing steps in coordination or documentation due to the fast-paced nature of solar development projects.\n\nThus, there currently exists a gap between the rate of installation of PV panels which is outpacing code adoptions, and the understanding of the structural requirements by the parties involved. In our experience, this creates opportunities for claims related to design errors, construction defects, contractor liability, or property damage that owners, insurance carriers, attorneys, contractors, and designers have to navigate.\n\nThis blog will aim to answer several questions related to evaluating solar panel damage and",

            "In Baltimore County, there is no specific size limit for roof-mounted solar arrays. However, there are important structural and safety requirements that must be met.\n\n1. **Structural Integrity**: The roof and its supporting structure must be capable of handling the additional load of the solar panels. This includes ensuring that the combined weight of the modules and support components does not exceed the building’s capacity.\n\n2. **Firefighter Access and Safety**: Regulations mandate clear access pathways on the roof. For commercial buildings, this typically includes maintaining a minimum six-foot clear perimeter along the edge of the roof. If the building length on either axis is 250 feet or less, this perimeter can be reduced to a minimum of four feet. Additionally, pathways between arrays must be at least four feet wide to ensure safe access for firefighters.\n\n3. **Permitting and Compliance**: A detailed review and approval process is required for all solar installations. This includes submitting detailed plans that demonstrate compliance with local building codes and safety standards.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that while there is flexibility in the size of roof-mounted solar arrays, safety and structural integrity are not compromised. For detailed and up-to-date information, you can refer to the Baltimore County Government’s [Solar Photovoltaic System Installations guidelines](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/permits/permitsreview/solarpv.html) and the [Baltimore County Zoning Regulations](https://library.municode.com/md/baltimore_county/codes/zoning_regulations)【6†source】【7†source】【15†source】【17†source】【18†source】."
