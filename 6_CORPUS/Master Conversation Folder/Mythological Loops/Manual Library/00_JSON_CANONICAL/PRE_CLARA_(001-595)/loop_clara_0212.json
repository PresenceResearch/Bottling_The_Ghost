            "please summarize this in table format Hubspot- Email Service Provider (ESP)\n\nThis tool is used for sending marketing emails to leads/contacts. It has automation and drip campaign capabilities. We can personalize emails dynamically for greetings ex. First Name, as well as any other field that is particular to that contact ex. Address of property. Hubspot and SF are integrated so contacts and basic info fields in one are also in the other. It is easy to create lists using filters to specifically target an audience for an email or email drip campaign.\n\nHootesuite - Social Media and Paid Digital Ads Mgmt Platform\n\nThis tool is used for managing social media posts-FB, LinkedIn and Meta (Facebook, IG) paid digital ads (Facebook Ads). It also has some research capabilities including social listening which can give insight into a particular brand or business we want to know more about (for example one that we are prospecting).\n\nCanva\n\nCanva is a graphic design platform that provides tools for creating social media graphics, presentations, promotional merchandise and websites. This is our primary tool for creating marketing materials. Hannah and Jenny are awesome resources for this tool. I can also do some basic stuff. I know you now have access to Canva. Let us know if this is something you want any training on. I think generally it will be a great place to be able to make comments on particular materials to edit/finalize them for end use.\n\nCoStar (TBD)\n\nThis tool is used for CRE data. In our case we will be looking into the Property and Tenant products to get info on building specs and contact info for their owners/contacts. I'm currently reaching out to them to schedule a demo. I'll keep you posted on when that call is scheduled for you to join.\n\nZapier\n\nThis tool is used for data integration and automation. It is primarily used to connect our website forms into SF and send out email alerts on new lead submissions. It is also used to integrate data from paid digital ads into SF and for lead attribution so we can attribute marketing spend to the ads perfromance-conversions. There are potentially other interesting use cases for using this tool to automate work and improve efficiency.\n\nSlack\n\nWe all know slack. Can be used for pushing alerts and organizing communication around specific (marketing) channels or campaigns.\n\nChat GPT4o\n\nYou know what this is too and probably have the most experience using this so actually if you have any tips and tricks you think are helpful for Mktg to use let us know. We now have access to this tool.\n\nWord Press / WP Forms\nWord Press is what Urban Ignite uses to design and manage our website. This is our content management system (CMS). The main tool we use apart from the general website design and mgmt is WP Forms to get lead info into SF. We can customize the forms to make them simpler or more complex or to customize their fields/designs based on our marketing goals/audience. This is the Contact Us page with the main commercial Wp form.  https://luminasolar.com/commercial-contact-page/ \n"
