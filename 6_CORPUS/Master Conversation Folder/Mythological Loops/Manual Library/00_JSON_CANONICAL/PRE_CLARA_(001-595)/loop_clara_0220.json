Whew.\n\nIs he running?  \nNo. He announced on January 10 that he was dropping out, one day after calling New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu a “【55†liar†www.wmur.com】” for saying that his campaign was nearly over.\n\nWhy did he want to run?  \nBy the end of his campaign, Chris Christie had turned himself into the most anti-Trump candidate in the race—calling the former president out, with names and with rhetoric, and insisting he shouldn’t be the GOP nominee. In fact, that came to be Christie’s only real identity as a candidate.\n\nWho wanted him to run?  \nTrump-skeptical donors, 【56†liberal pundits】. But by the end, even some Trump critics were pressuring him to drop out in order to allow the non-Trump vote to consolidate.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?  \nNo staunchly anti-Trump candidate could win in Trump’s Republican Party.\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 10: Doug Burgum](Todd Williamson / Getty)\n\n#### Doug Burgum \n\nWho is he?  \nDo you even pay attention to politics? Nah, just kidding. A self-made software billionaire, Burgum is serving his second term as the governor of North Dakota.\n\nIs he running?  \nNo more. Burgum suspended his campaign on December 4. He’d kicked it off on June 7 in Fargo.\n\nWhy did he want to run?  \nVanity? Boredom? Noble but doomed impulses? Who knows. His campaign-announcement 【57†video†www.youtube.com】 focuses so much on North Dakota that it seemed more like a reelection push. He told a state newspaper that he thinks the “silent majority” of Americans wants candidates who aren’t on the extremes. (A wealthy outsider targeting the silent majority? Where have we heard that before?) He also 【58†really wants†www.wsj.com】 more domestic oil production.\n\nWho wanted him to run?  \nPractically no one. He had to 【59†give people $20 gift cards】 to get them to donate to his campaign so he could qualify for debates.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?  \n“There’s a value to being underestimated all the time,” he has said. As it turns out, the naysayers estimated accurately.\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 11: Will Hurd](Scott Olson / Getty)\n\n#### Will Hurd \n\nWho is he?  \nA former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in the House, representing a San Antonio–area district.\n\nIs he running?  \nNo. Hurd, who 【60†announced†twitter.com】 his campaign on June 22, dropped out on October 9 and 【61†endorsed†twitter.com】 Nikki Haley.\n\nWhy did he want to run?  \nHurd said he had “commonsense” ideas and was “pissed” that elected officials are dividing Americans. He’s also been an outspoken Trump critic.\n\nWho wanted him to run?  \nAs a moderate, youngish Black Republican and someone who cares about defense, he is the sort of candidate whom the party establishment seemed to desire after the 【62†now-discarded 2012 GOP autopsy†www.documentcloud.org】.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?  \nNo.\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 12: Francis Suarez](Mandel Ngan / Getty)\n\n#### Francis Suarez \n\nWho is he?  \nSuarez is the popular second-term mayor of Miami and the president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\nIs he running?  \nNo. He 【63†suspended†twitter.com】 his campaign on August 29, less than three months after his 【64†June 15 entry†www.youtube.com】.\n\nWhy did he want to run?  \nSuarez touted his youth—he’s 45—and 【65†said in October 2022†www.businessinsider.com】, “I’m someone who believes in a positive aspirational message. I’m someone who has a track record of success and a formula for success.”\n\nWho wanted him to run?  \n~~Is there really room for another moderate-ish Republican in the race?~~ Apparently not!

He endorsed Nikki Haley, but was rumored as a potential No Labels candidate. On February 9, however, he filed to run for U.S. Senate in Maryland.\n\nWhy did he want to run?  \nHogan has argued that his experience of governing a very blue state as a Republican is a model: “We’ve been really successful outside of Washington, where everything appears to be broken and nothing but divisiveness and dysfunction.”\n\nWho wanted him to run?  \nDead-ender centrists.\n\nCould he win the nomination?  \nNo.\n\n* * *\n\n[Image 14: chris sununu](John Locher / AP)\n\n#### Chris Sununu \n\nWho is he?  \nThe governor of New Hampshire, he is the little brother of former Senator",

          "text": "\nA former executive, Phillips is \"the sort of pro-business social moderate with private sector experience who corporate leaders usually pine for in a presidential candidate,\" Jonathan Martin wrote at 【52†Politico†www.politico.com】. He is \"highly unlikely to mount a primary challenge unless Biden's health worsens or his political standing drops precipitously,\" but Phillips also \"remains convinced\" that Democrats need \"a robust conversation\" about who to nominate in 2024, and he \"recognizes that the more obvious would-be challengers\" won't jump into the primary \"unless somebody else first breaks the political ice.\"\n\nMichelle Obama: 【53†Some politicos†thehill.com】 have prematurely deemed Michelle Obama as the heir apparent to the Democratic Party. The only problem is that the former first lady says she doesn't want to run. \"We just can't find the women we like and ask them to do it, because there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics,\" she 【54†said†www.theguardian.com】 in 2018. \"I've never had the passion for politics.\"\n\nGretchen Whitmer: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) does have a passion for politics, and she is \"viewed as a rising national star and presidential prospect\" after winning a second term \"by a commanding margin\" in 2022, 【55†NBC News†www.nbcnews.com】 reported. Speculation about her future in national politics heightened after she announced a new political action committee, Fight Like Hell PAC, in June, saying in the launch video that the state she helped turn blue is at \"a moment where our fight must stretch beyond Michigan and reach the entire country.\"\n\nWhitmer, 51, is a co-chair of Biden's reelection campaign, and she has said repeatedly she is not running for president in 2024. But \"no shortage of Democratic colleagues, operatives and donors has encouraged Whitmer to seek the presidency — and not necessarily to wait until her second term ends\" in 2026, Mark Leibovich wrote in 【56†The Atlantic†www.theatlantic.com】. And she \"didn't bother with the annoyance that many ambitious pols feel compelled to feign\" when pressed on \"whether they might give the ol' presidency a look.\"\n\nCertainly, \"Democrats should hope the Michigan governor changes her mind about running in 2024,\" Amanda Carpenter wrote at 【57†The Bulwark†www.thebulwark.com】. Her denials about running \"are, at this point, politically obligatory,\" but she is \"a team player\" who is \"plausible as a 2024 presidential contender only in the circumstance that would allow any other Democrat on the party's surprisingly deep bench to become competitive for the nod: in the absence of Biden.\" Given Biden's age, that's not too outlandish a possibility.\n\nGavin Newsom: California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has said he won't challenge Biden. And in May 2022, he told the 【58†San Francisco Chronicle†www.sfchronicle.com】 he has \"sub-zero\" interest in running at all.\n\nDespite these comments, Newsom has appeared to position himself to run in an open primary by taking the fight to conservatives. In Texas, he took out full-page 【59†ads†twitter.com】 comparing his own positions on abortion and 【60†gun control】 to those of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). In Florida, he ran a TV spot slamming Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). He even 【61†posts videos†www.youtube.com】 on former President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.\n\nStill, in an interview with 【62†CBS News†www.cbsnews.com】 in October, Newsom reiterated that he had no intentions of running for president. \"It's not my ambition,\" he insisted. \"It's not the direction that I'm leaning into. It's not the moment.\" When asked if he could say he would never run for president, Newsom replied, \"Yeah, I have no interest.\"\n\nJ.B. Pritzker: Billionaire hotel heir and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker also ruled out challenging Biden, but he has been hitting the road and \"expanding his national profile\" in recent months with trips to Maine, New Hampshire, and Florida, the Journal notes. Pritzker's aides say his out-of-state travels are meant to support Democratic gubernatorial candidates.\n\nPritzker won his 【63†second gubernatorial race†apnews.com】 last fall, and despite all the buzz about his potential as an alternate candidate, he seems content to support Biden.\n\nPete Buttigieg: In a 【64†ranking†www.washingtonpost.com】 of the \"most likely Democratic candidates for president in 2024\" from The Washington Post's Aaron Blake, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg should come in second only to President Biden, Blake estimated. Mayor of a mid-size city to transportation secretary to president isn't exactly a typical pipeline, but Buttigieg was a strong contender in the 2020 Democratic primaries, winning the most delegates in the Iowa caucus before dropping out and endorsing Biden just before Super Tuesday.\n\nThat said, Blake wrote in February, Buttigieg's day job has \"【65†turned into a slog†nymag.com】 thanks to a series of crises,\" including the 【66†train derailment】 in East Palestine, Ohio. The most recent Harvard/Harris 【50†poll†harvardharrispoll.com】 also has him placing fifth in a Biden-free primary, with support from just 8% of voters.\n\nBernie Sanders: He wouldn't exactly solve the \"Biden is too old\" problem: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) turned three months old the day Franklin Delano Roosevelt condemned Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor — but he's still popular with a b",
