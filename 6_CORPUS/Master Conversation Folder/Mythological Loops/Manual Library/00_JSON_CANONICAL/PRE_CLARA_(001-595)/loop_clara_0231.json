The utility said the increases at that level would help pay to improve service and for other capital projects, like substations and replacing lines and poles across Maryland. \n\n## 【55†Reading up on the candidates before you vote?

Richard agreed that some increase should be permitted and voted yes to the lower amount. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nBut they said Pepco should have done a better job in forecasting its future costs associated with improvements to its service and other capital projects. \n\n## 【24†Want more political and government news?

They said their concerns about Pepco’s forecasts and overall transparency during the process meant they couldn’t support a large increase in utility rates. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, which represents residential customers in Public Service Commission cases, agreed with Linton and Herman. \n\nArmstrong said Pepco officials are still reviewing the PSC’s order, but much of the rate increases “are going right back into the system,” which has improved in overall reliability over roughly the last decade. The utility is still determining which projects to consider since the full request wasn’t funded, he said. \n\nThe Office of People’s Counsel said in a press release that the PSC “denied accelerated recovery of several high-price distribution substation projects, totaling more than $56 million.” \n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe PSC also denied Pepco’s streetlight conversion project, according to the Office of People’s Counsel. \n\nDuring the past 10 years, “ongoing investments in the local energy grid have driven a 68 percent decrease in the frequency of electric outages Pepco customers have experienced” across Maryland and Washington, D",

            "Analyzing PEPCO commercial electricity prices in the District of Columbia over the last 15 years shows a trend of periodic increases and adjustments reflective of market conditions and regulatory decisions. Historical data from the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) reveals that Pepco's Standard Offer Service (SOS) rates for electricity have seen fluctuations, with a mix of rate hikes and reductions over this period. Notably, Pepco announced significant price increases for 2023-2024, with commercial customers expected to see their rates jump by at least 66% compared to the previous year【6†source】【7†source】.\n\nFuture projections for the next ten years indicate that commercial electricity rates will likely continue to rise. The DCPSC has approved a multi-year rate plan for Pepco, authorizing the utility to recover $108.6 million through higher rates, translating to continued increases in electricity costs for consumers【8†source】【9†source】.\n\nIn terms of approved rate increases over the next few years, the DCPSC has already sanctioned a structured increase in Pepco's rates. These adjustments are part of a broader plan to enhance service reliability and fund critical infrastructure projects. For instance, there are planned average monthly increases of $3.66 in 2022 and another $1.54 in 2023【9†source】.\n\nFor a detailed and up-to-date understanding of current and future electricity rates, it is advisable to refer to the DCPSC's official releases and Pepco's announcements, as they provide comprehensive insights into approved rate changes and the factors influencing them."
