Second, the map shows the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and non-metropolitan statistical areas (non-MSAs) that are energy communities for 2023.

The interactive map provides access to publicly available information on facilities, nearby infrastructure, and community attributes, including energy community census tracts. The Site Review Tool empowers community leaders and developers to promote investment into energy communities and encourages users to learn and explore the diverse range of investment options.\n\nThis tool can be useful for applicants to identify relevant information about their project that is requested in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) grant and tax credit submissions, including Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (§ 48C) program energy community status and whether a project is located in a disadvantaged community.\n\n【27†Click here or on the map below to open full screen.†edxspatial.arcgis.netl.doe.gov】\n\n【27† †edxspatial.arcgis.netl.doe.gov】 \n\nFor general questions or comments, contact Contact@EnergyCommunities.gov.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe mapping tool may not be relied upon by taxpayers to substantiate a tax return position or for determining whether certain penalties apply and will not be used by the IRS for examination purposes.

          "text": "\n  26. If an MSA or non-MSA qualifies as an energy community by satisfying both the fossil-fuel employment threshold and the unemployment rate threshold, how long does that qualification last? \n\nMSAs and non-MSAs must meet two thresholds to qualify as energy communities. The MSAs and non-MSAs must have had (1) for at least one year after 2009, 0.17 percent or greater direct employment related to extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas (the fossil fuel employment (FFE) threshold), and (2) an unemployment rate for the prior year that is equal to or greater than the national average unemployment rate for the prior year.\n\nMSAs/non-MSAs that meet the 2023 unemployment rate requirement and the FFE requirement are listed in IRS Notice 2024-48 Appendix 1 and qualify as energy communities as of June 7, 2024. These MSAs/non-MSAs will maintain energy community status until the 2025 IRS release of the Annual Statistical Area Category and Coal Closure Category Updates for the energy community bonus (reflecting unemployment rates from 2024). The IRS guidance that determines the MSAs and non-MSAs that are energy communities based on future years’ unemployment rates will be released in approximately May of each year.\n\n  27. Can an MSA or non-MSA that was qualified as an energy community lose its qualified status? \n\nYes. An MSA or non-MSA that has had 0.17 percent or greater direct employment at any time after December 31, 2009, or 25 percent or greater local tax revenues related to the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas may qualify as an energy community if its unemployment rate for the previous year is at or above the national average. Because an MSA’s or non-MSA’s status as an energy community depends on its unemployment rate for the previous year, an MSA or non-MSA that qualifies as an energy community in one period might not qualify as an energy community in a later period if its unemployment rate for the previous year falls below the national average. The list of MSAs and non-MSAs that qualify as an energy community for the period beginning on the June 7, 2024, and ending on the date of release of the 2025 Annual Statistical Area Category and Coal Closure Category Updates, may be found at Notice 2024-48 Appendix 2.\n\n  28. How often does Treasury anticipate updating the maps and data? \n\nThe map and community listings will be updated with the following timing:\n\nTreasury/IRS anticipate that in approximately May of each subsequent year until the energy community bonus expires:\n\n  * The map will be updated according to any new MSAs/non-MSAs that have achieved the 0.17 percent or greater direct employment related to the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas.\n  * The map will be updated according to the updated annual unemployment rates for MSAs and non-MSAs. Because an MSA’s or non-MSA’s status as an energy community depends on its unemployment rate for the previous year, an MSA or non-MSA that qualifies as an energy community in one period might not qualify as an energy community in a later period if its unemployment rate for the previous year falls below the national average.\n  * The map will reflect the census tracts and directly adjoining census tracts of any newly identified closed coal mines and/or retired coal-fired electric generating units.\n\n  29. Are the shapefiles and data available for download? \n\nThe shapefiles for the data layers can be found on the EDX resource page here:  【65†https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/ira-energy-community-data-layers†edx.netl.doe.gov】.\n\n## Timing and Location Questions\n\n  30. If the construction of my project began before 2023, does the special rule in IRS Notice 2023-29 that permits a project’s location to continue to be considered an energy community if such location is an energy community when construction began apply to my project? \n\nNo, the special rule in IRS Notice 2023-29 applies only to projects that begin construction on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n  31. If my project is located in an area that qualifies as an energy community under one of the three energy-community categories, do I also have to establish that such area also qualifies as an energy community under one of the other energy-community categories? \n\nNo, the special rule in IRS Notice 2023-29 applies only to projects that begin construction on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n  32. How much of my clean energy project needs to be located in an energy community for it to qualify for the energy community bonus credit? \n\nA project is treated as “located in” or “placed in service within” an energy community if 50% or more of the project’s nameplate capacity is located in an area that qualifies as an energy community (Nameplate Capacity Test).  This determination is made by dividing the nameplate capacity of the project’s energy-generating units located in an energy community by the total nameplate capacity of all the energy-generating units of the project.  For projects with offshore energy generation units, if none of the project’s energy-generating units are in a census tract, MSA, or non-MSA, then the Nameplate Capacity Attribution Rule is applied by attributing all the nameplate capacity of such project to the land-based power conditioning equipment that conditions ener",
