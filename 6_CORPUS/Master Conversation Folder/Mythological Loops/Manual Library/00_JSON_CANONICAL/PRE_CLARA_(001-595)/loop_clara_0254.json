Guaranteed to move and educate, The National WWII Museum features interactive exhibits, soaring aircraft, personal histories, and more.

Two immersive exhibitions—Road to Berlin: European Theater Galleries and Road to Tokyo: Pacific Theater Galleries—feature environmental exhibits that guide visitors chronologically through the narrative of each theater of combat, using a sophisticated mix of set design, narrated and environmental videos, period newsreels, interactive oral-history kiosks, personal and digital artifacts, and dynamic displays for a uniquely evocative experience. How long you spend inside the museum is up to you!
