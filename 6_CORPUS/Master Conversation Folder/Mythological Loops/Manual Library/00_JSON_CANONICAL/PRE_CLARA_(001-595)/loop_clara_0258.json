            "To adjust a $49,990 annual lease payment to reflect the addition of a 2% annual escalator over a 20-year period, we need to determine the equivalent initial lease payment that would result in the same total payment over 20 years when the 2% escalator is applied.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Given data**:\n   - Initial annual lease rate without escalator: $49,990\n   - Annual escalator: 2%\n   - Project lifespan: 20 years\n\n2. **Calculate the total payment with the 2% escalator**:\n   The total payment with the 2% annual escalator is calculated using the sum of a geometric series:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total payment with escalator} = P \\times \\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} (1 + r)^t\n   \\]\n   where \\( P \\) is the initial payment, \\( r \\) is the annual increase rate (0.02), and \\( n \\) is the number of years (20).\n\n   Using the sum of a geometric series:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{t=0}^{19} (1 + 0.02)^t = \\frac{(1 + 0.02)^{20} - 1}{0.02}\n   \\]\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 0.02)^{20} \\approx 1.485947\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{t=0}^{19} (1 + 0.02)^t \\approx \\frac{1.485947 - 1}{0.02} = 24.29735\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total payment with escalator**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total payment with escalator} = \\$49,990 \\times 24.29735 = \\$1,214,208.57\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the equivalent fixed annual payment**:\n   To find the equivalent fixed annual payment over 20 years, we need to find the present value of the escalated payments and then divide by the annuity factor.\n\n   The present value (PV) of the fixed payment is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{PV} = \\text{Fixed annual payment} \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( r \\) is the discount rate (which we will use the same as the escalation rate, 2%), and \\( n \\) is the number of years.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{PV} = \\$49,990 \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.02)^{-20}}{0.02} \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{PV} = \\$49,990 \\times 16.3514 = \\$817,746.73\n   \\]\n\n5. **Adjust the annual payment to remove the escalator**:\n   Now we need to distribute this PV over 20 years without any escalation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Equivalent annual payment} = \\frac{\\text{PV}}{n}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Equivalent annual payment} = \\frac{\\$817,746.73}{20} = \\$40,887.34\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the adjusted annual lease rate, reflecting the 2% escalator, would be approximately $40,887.34 per year if the 20-year escalator was taken out of the annual payment."

Cumulative payment over 25 years: $1,447,500.\n\nThis comparison shows how the annual payments and cumulative payments evolve over time for both systems. The system with the 2% annual escalator starts with a lower payment but increases significantly over time, leading to a much higher cumulative payment compared to the system with a fixed annual payment."

Fixed at $138,960 per year.\n  - Cumulative payment over 25 years: $3,474,000.\n\nThis comparison shows how the annual payments and cumulative payments evolve over time for both systems. The system with the 2% annual escalator starts with a lower payment but increases significantly over time, leading to a higher cumulative payment compared to the system with a fixed annual payment."
