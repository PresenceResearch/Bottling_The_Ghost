            "To determine a fair listing price for your DeWalt Bluetooth speaker, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Research Current Prices:** Look up the current retail price of the same model to see how much it sells for new.\n\n2. **Check Used Prices:** Search online marketplaces like eBay, Amazon, and Craigslist to see what similar used models are selling for.\n\n3. **Assess Condition:** Evaluate the condition of your speaker. If it’s in like-new condition with minimal wear and all original parts, you can price it higher than if it shows signs of heavy use.\n\n4. **Include Accessories:** If you have any accessories, original packaging, or manuals, mention these in your listing as they can add value.\n\n5. **Competitive Pricing:** Consider pricing it slightly lower than the average used price to attract more buyers quickly.\n\n### Example Pricing:\n\n- **Excellent Condition, Like New:** Around 70-80% of the retail price.\n- **Good Condition:** About 50-60% of the retail price.\n- **Fair Condition:** 30-40% of the retail price.\n\nIf you can provide the model number or look up the current retail price and recent listings, I can help narrow down the suggested listing price further."
