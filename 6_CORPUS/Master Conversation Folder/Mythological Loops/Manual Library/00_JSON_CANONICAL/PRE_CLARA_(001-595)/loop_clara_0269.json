          "text": "\nBy increasing the SACP, the law effectively increased the “price ceiling” for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs), and therefore the likely price at which SRECs will sell. Currently, the SACP is $80 per SREC for 2021 and $60 per SREC for 2022. Before SB 65, the SACP was set to drop to $45 per SREC in 2023, then $40 in 2024 and $35 in 2025. SB 65 increased these price ceilings to $60 per SREC in 2023 and 2024, and $55 in 2025.\n\nWhile the Tier I and solar carve-out requirement decreases may seem negative, the amended requirements paired with the SACP increase may positively impact Maryland SREC prices and Maryland solar build. The new requirements should help Maryland solar supply and demand move closer together. To date, Maryland’s actual solar supply has lagged behind the demand for solar. By decreasing utility demand and increasing supply incentives (SREC prices), solar project origination and generation should increase accordingly.\n\nWe are already seeing Maryland SREC pricing rise and expect solar project origination to increase as well. These developments are exciting and beneficial to homeowners, installers, and developers throughout Maryland.\n\nTo compare all the RPS and SACP changes in Maryland, please refer to the table below.\n\nYear Old Solar Carve-Out New Solar Carve-Out Old Tier I Requirement New Tier I Requirement Old SACP  New SACP Tier I ACP (Unchanged)  \n2021 7.5% n/a 30.8% n/a $80.00 n/a $30.00  \n2022 8.5% 5.5% 33.1% 30.1% $60.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2023 9.5% 6.0% 35.4% 31.9% $45.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2024 10.5% 6.5% 37.7% 33.7% $40.00 $60.00 $27.50  \n2025 11.5% 7.0% 40.0% 35.5% $35.00 $55.00 $25.00  \n2026 12.5% 8.0% 42.5% 38.0% $30.00 $45.00 $24.75  \n2027 13.5% 9.5% 45.5% 41.5% $25.00 $35.00 $24.50  \n2028 14.5% 11.0% 47.5% 43.0% $22.50 $32.50 $22.50  \n2029 14.5% 12.5% 49.5% 47.5% $22.50 $25.00 $22.50  \n2030+ 14.5% 14.5% 50% 50.0% $22.50 $22.25 $22.35  \n\n* * *\n\n### Recent Articles...\n\nInsights | 20 May 2024 \n\n【21†Good Intentions, Bad Policy, and the Threat to the Clean Energy Transition】 \n\nCommunity Impact | 20 Mar 2024 \n\n【22†From Vision to Impact: Sol Systems’ Journey Towards a Community-Focused Clean Energy Economy】 \n\nCommunity Impact | 28 Nov 2023 \n\n【23†DC Greens: Building Impact Through a Sustainable and Resilient Food System】 \n\n### Explore sustainable energy solutions with Sol Systems\n\n【3†WHO WE SERVE】\n\n【2†WHAT WE DO】\n\nLooking for something else?  \nEmail: info@solsystems.com \n\nSol Systems \n\nSol Systems is a leading, national solar energy firm with an established reputation for integrity and reliability across its distinct and complementary businesses.

See Maryland's post here: 【30†https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783†mgaleg.maryland.gov】\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named “The Brighter Tomorrow Act”, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as “Certified SRECs” and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC. \n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites. \n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025 \n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified “implied” SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill – HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n【31†https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf†mgaleg.maryland.gov】\n\nTAGS:  \n【32†Maryland】【33†SREC】【34†Solar】\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * 【20†How Flett Exchange Works】 \n  * 【1†Apply for an Account】\n  * 【35†Exchange Benefits】\n  * 【23†What is an SREC】\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * 【10†New Jersey SREC】 \n  * 【27†New Jersey TREC】\n  * 【12†Pennsylvania SREC】\n  * 【13†Maryland SREC】\n  * 【15†Washington DC SREC】\n  * 【16†Ohio SREC】\n  * 【17†Virginia REC】\n  * 【18†NJ Class 1】 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * 【2†Public Auctions】\n  * 【5†Long-Term SREC Contracts】\n  * 【4†Spot Markets】\n  * 【9†PSE&G Solar Loan】\n  * 【6†JCP&L】 \n  * 【7†Atlantic City Electric】\n  * 【8†Rockland Electric】\n  * 【36†Solar Installers】\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * 【24†New Jersey】 \n  * 【37†Pennsylvania】 \n  * 【32†Maryland】\n  * 【38†Washington, DC】\n  * 【39†Ohio】\n  * 【40†Virginia】\n  * 【41†Press Releases】\n  * 【42†RGGI】\n  * 【43†Federal Grants】\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * 【",

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the 【32†The Maryland Solar Bill】.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland’s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about 【33†Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation】.

Currently, homeowners with systems installed after 07/01/24 will begin generating Certified SRECs on 01/01/2025, which are expected to be worth around 1.5x the current Legacy MD SRECs. Homeowners in Maryland who are interested in the possibility of installing solar will benefit massively from these higher priced SRECs, and can enjoy the benefit of incentives like the Federal Investment Tax Credit and the MD FY2025 Solar Access Program, which is designed to provide grant money for low to moderate income residents. \n\nFlett Exchange has also released a free to use solar installation financial model. We suggest using this model to fully realize the advantages and long term cash flows of a solar investment before having a conversation with a solar installer. Flett Exchange is a neutral third party that does not profit off of the installation of a solar array; we simply broker SRECs produced by homeowners. This affords us the unique position to offer unbiased, informative, and realistic forecasts and consulting on solar investments. If you are interested in potentially going solar, contact Flett Exchange for a zero cost consultation service and we can help match you with a solar installation company. The goal of Flett Exchange, ultimately, is to broker more SREC deals; we are not involved in any capacity with the process of installing solar arrays. It is our hope that this complementary service will steer you in our direction to sell your SRECs post installation. \n\n【32†MD Solar PV Installation Cash Flow Model†www.flettexchange.com】\n\nListed below are some key assumptions of the model: \n\n  * The Maryland Energy Administration will provide grants of $750/kW  with a $7,500 cap to low to middle income homeowners for installation of a residential solar system\n\n  * The Maryland utility bill inflation rate is 2.83% annually. This number is derived from the average utility bill from 2014-2023 for five major state power companies: Delmarva Power, PEPCO, SMECO, BGE, and Potomac Edison. \n\n  * A residential solar installation will yield positive cash flow from SREC income, as well as an implied positive cash flow from avoided utility costs\n\n  * The SACP set by the Maryland RPS will decrease incrementally as expected, and this benchmark will serve as a proxy for yearly SREC prices throughout the life of the system \n\nTAGS:  \n【33†Federal Grants】【34†Press Releases】【35†SREC】【36†Research】【37†Maryland Certified】\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * 【22†How Flett Exchange Works】 \n  * 【2†Apply for an Account】\n  * 【38†Exchange Benefits】\n  * 【25†What is an SREC】\n\n##### Calculators\n\n  * 【1†Maryland Solar Installation Financial Model】\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * 【11†New Jersey SREC】 \n  * 【29†New Jersey TREC】\n  * 【13†Pennsylvania SREC】\n  * 【14†Maryland SREC】\n  * 【15†Maryland Certified SREC】\n  * 【16†Maryland GREC】\n  * 【17†Washington DC SREC】\n  * 【18†Ohio SREC】\n  * 【19†Virginia REC】\n  * 【20†NJ Class 1】 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * 【3†Public Auctions】\n  * 【6†Long-Term SREC Contracts】\n  * 【5†Spot Markets】\n  * 【10†PSE&G Solar Loan】\n  * 【7†JCP&L】 \n  * 【8†Atlantic City Electric】\n  * 【9†Rockland Electric】\n  * 【39†Solar Installers】\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * 【26†New Jersey】 \n  * 【40†Pennsylvania】 \n  * 【41†Maryland】\n  * 【42†Washington, DC】\n  * 【43†Ohio】\n  * 【44†Virginia】\n  * 【34†Press Releases】\n  * 【45†RGGI】\n  * 【33†Federal Grants】\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * 【46†Disclaimer】\n  * 【47†User Agreement】\n  * 【48†Auction Rules】\n  * 【23†Fee Schedule",

            "As of July 1, 2024, the adjusted value for Maryland Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) reflects significant legislative changes. Systems installed after this date will generate what are termed \"Certified SRECs,\" which can satisfy 150% of a utility's compliance requirement. This implies a premium value compared to legacy SRECs.\n\n### Key Details:\n1. **Maryland Certified SREC Market Launch**: Systems installed after July 1, 2024, will begin producing Certified SRECs starting January 1, 2025. These SRECs will initially be priced at approximately 1.5 times the legacy SREC value【9†source】【10†source】.\n   \n2. **SREC Prices and Premiums**: \n   - For 2025, Certified SRECs are expected to have an implied SACP (Solar Alternative Compliance Payment) of $82.50, with an estimated premium of $27.50 above the regular SACP of $55【11†source】【9†source】.\n   - This premium reflects the increased value utilities derive from using Certified SRECs to meet a larger portion of their compliance obligations.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: \n   - The Maryland Solar Bill (HB1435/SB0737) introduced these changes to boost solar adoption by providing more incentives through higher SREC values and extended SREC lifespan from three to five years【8†source】【9†source】.\n   - New installations on rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites are particularly incentivized【10†source】.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can review the sources from Sol Systems and Flett Exchange, which provide insights into these legislative updates and their implications for SREC markets【8†source】【10†source】."
