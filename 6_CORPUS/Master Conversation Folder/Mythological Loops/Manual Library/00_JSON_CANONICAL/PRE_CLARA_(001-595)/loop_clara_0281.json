If you're signed in, your phone should automatically associate the Apple ID with the new eSIM.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you may need to sign out of your Apple ID and sign back in.

It should reflect data usage under the Japanese eSIM.\n\nBy doing this, you ensure that you avoid incurring any unexpected data charges from Verizon while using your Japanese eSIM for mobile data."
