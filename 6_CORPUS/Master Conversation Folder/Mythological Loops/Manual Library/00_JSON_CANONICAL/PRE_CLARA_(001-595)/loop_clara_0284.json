            "Typhoons and hurricanes are essentially the same meteorological phenomenon—a type of tropical cyclone—but they are named differently depending on where they occur. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Location**: \n   - **Hurricanes** occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n   - **Typhoons** occur in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the region of Asia.\n\n2. **Naming Convention**: \n   - The term \"hurricane\" is used in the Americas, including the United States and Caribbean nations.\n   - The term \"typhoon\" is used primarily in Southeast Asia, Japan, and China.\n\n3. **Intensity and Structure**: \n   - Both hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones with similar structure, featuring a central eye, eye wall, and spiraling rainbands.\n   - The intensity of these storms is measured using similar scales, like the Saffir-Simpson scale for hurricanes and the JMA scale for typhoons, though the names and categories may differ slightly.\n\n4. **Seasonality**: \n   - Hurricane season in the Atlantic typically runs from June to November.\n   - Typhoon season in the northwest Pacific can be more variable, though it often peaks from May to October.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference between a typhoon and a hurricane is their geographic location. Both terms refer to powerful tropical cyclones but are used in different parts of the world."
