Japanese slang tends to have its own unique expressions, so while people in Japan might be aware of the American slang, they wouldn't typically use \"Gucci\" in the same way. \n\nIf you want to say something is cool or good in Japanese slang, you might use terms like **かっこいい (Kakkoii)** for \"cool\" or **いいね (Ii ne)** for \"that's good\" or \"nice.\""

It's a strong expression, so it conveys a significant level of frustration.\n\n2. **ウザい (Uzai)** - This word is used to describe something or someone that is really annoying or irritating. It’s a bit more casual than \"mukatsuku\" but still conveys annoyance.\n\n3. **イラつく (Iratsuku)** - This is another term that means to be irritated or annoyed. It's similar to \"mukatsuku\" but can be used in a slightly broader range of situations.\n\nThese terms are often used in casual conversations among friends or when venting frustration."
