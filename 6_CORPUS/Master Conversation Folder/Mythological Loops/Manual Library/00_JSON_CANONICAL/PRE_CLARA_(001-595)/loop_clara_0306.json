            "The flags you see over the doors of restaurants in Japan are called **\"のれん\" (noren)**. Noren are traditional Japanese fabric dividers, typically hung in doorways or windows of shops, restaurants, and other establishments. They serve several purposes:\n\n1. **Indicate that the shop is open**: When the noren is hung out, it usually signifies that the establishment is open for business. When the noren is taken down, it indicates that the shop is closed.\n\n2. **Branding and decoration**: Noren often feature the shop's name, logo, or symbols related to the business, serving as a form of signage and branding. They also add to the aesthetic appeal of the entrance.\n\n3. **Privacy and protection**: Noren provide a sense of privacy for customers inside the shop by partially shielding the interior from outside view. They also offer some protection from the elements, such as sun, wind, or dust.\n\n4. **Cultural significance**: Noren have a deep cultural significance and are associated with the spirit of Japanese hospitality (おもてなし, omotenashi). They create a welcoming atmosphere and are part of the traditional Japanese approach to customer service.\n\nOverall, noren are both practical and symbolic, contributing to the atmosphere and identity of the establishment."

            "Yes, the Tokyo subway does offer free Wi-Fi. Most of the major subway lines in Tokyo, including those operated by **Tokyo Metro** and **Toei Subway**, provide free Wi-Fi services at many stations and on some trains. \n\nTo connect to the free Wi-Fi, look for networks such as **\"Metro_Free_Wi-Fi\"** for Tokyo Metro or **\"Toei_Subway_Free_Wi-Fi\"** for Toei Subway. After selecting the network, you'll typically need to open your browser and follow the instructions to log in. You might be asked to agree to the terms of service or register with an email address or social media account.\n\nThe Wi-Fi coverage is usually strong in station areas, but it might be less reliable when the train is moving between stations. It's a convenient service for tourists and commuters alike, helping you stay connected while traveling around the city."
