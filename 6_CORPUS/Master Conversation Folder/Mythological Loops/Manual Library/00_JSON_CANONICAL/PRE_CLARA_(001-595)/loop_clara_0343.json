          "text": "\n  * AI writing assistance for emails, documents, and more \n  * Workflow automations for common tasks \n  * Customizable templates and snippets \n  * Integrations with Gmail, Outlook, Slack, and other tools \n\nFlowrite is an AI writing assistant that aims to streamline your workflows and boost productivity. \n\nIts standout feature is the ability to generate high-quality content for emails, documents, social media posts, and more using advanced AI language models.\n\nBut Flowrite goes beyond just writing assistance. \n\nIt also offers powerful workflow automations that can save you tons of time on repetitive tasks. \n\nFor example, you can create custom commands to instantly generate meeting agendas, project updates, or any other content you need on a regular basis.\n\nI also really like Flowrite's library of customizable templates and snippets. This makes it easy to maintain a consistent voice and brand across all your communications.\n\n[Image 8: Flowrite draft generation example] (【45†Image Source†www.flowrite.com】) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nOne of the things I appreciated most about Flowrite is how seamlessly it integrates with the tools I already use, like Gmail, Outlook, and Slack. \n\nThis allowed me to access its AI writing capabilities right where I needed them, without disrupting my existing workflows.\n\nThe quality of the AI-generated content is also top-notch. \n\nFlowrite does an impressive job of capturing the right tone and style, whether I need something formal for a client email or more casual for an internal team update.‎\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile Flowrite's automations are incredibly powerful, there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to setting them up initially. \n\nThe platform could benefit from some more user-friendly onboarding and documentation to help new users get the most out of these advanced features.\n\nAdditionally, as an AI-powered tool, Flowrite isn't perfect. \n\nOccasionally, the generated content can feel a bit generic or miss the mark in terms of context and nuance. \n\nHowever, this is a limitation of AI writing assistants in general, and Flowrite does a better job than most at producing high-quality, tailored content.\n\n#### Flowrite pricing (billed annually)\n\nLight plan: $4 per month for 200 messages per year \n\nPremium plan: $12 per month for 2,000 messages per year \n\nUnlimited plan: $24 per month for unlimited messages \n\nEnterprise: Contact for pricing \n\nAll plans include a 14-day free trial, no credit card required.\n\n  CTA Template\n\nIntelligently plan your day with Motion\n\nSign up now to get started\n\n【23†Get Started†app.usemotion.com】 \n\n### Mi‎ssive: Best AI email assistant for team collaboration \n\n#### Available on \n\n  * Web app, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS \n\n#### Standout features \n\n  * Team inboxes that integrate email, SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, live chat, and custom channels \n  * Internal team chat, 【46†task creation】 and assignment \n  * Canned responses and email templates \n  * Integrations with Gmail, Office 365, Apple Mail, Pipedrive, and more \n\nIf you're looking for an AI email assistant that's built for team collaboration, Missive is hard to beat. \n\nMissive provides a shared inbox that allows your entire team to manage emails together, reducing back-and-forth and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.\n\nBut what really sets Missive apart is its suite of collaboration tools. \n\nThe built-in team chat makes it easy to discuss emails and delegate tasks in real-time. \n\nYou can also create canned responses and email templates to ensure consistent, on-brand messaging across your team.\n\n####   \n\n[Image 9: Missive platform interface] (【47†Image Source†missiveapp.com】) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nOne of my favorite things about Missive is how deeply it integrates with the tools and workflows my team already uses. \n\nWhether we're working out of Gmail, Office 365, or a CRM like Pipedrive, Missive slots right in and enhances our existing processes.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Missive's responsive support and onboarding. \n\nThe team really goes above and beyond to ensure you get the most out of the platform from day one.\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nAs powerful as Missive is, it's not the most user-friendly tool out there – especially for new users. \n\nWith so many features and customization options packed in, there's definitely a learning curve involved. \n\nThe interface can feel a bit overwhelming at first.\n\nWhile Missive's pricing is competitive for small teams, it can get quite pricey as you add more users. \n\nThis may make it less accessible for larger organizations or those on tight budgets.‎\n\n#### Missive pricing \n\nFree plan \n\nStarter plan: $14 per user per month \n\nProductive plan: $18 per user per month \n\nBusiness plan: $26 per user per month \n\nPaid plans include a 30-day money-back guarantee if you aren’t satisfied.\n\n### Sm‎artWriter: Best AI email assistant for personalized outreach campaigns \n\n#### Available on \n\n  * Web app \n\n#### Standout features \n\n  * AI-powered cold email and LinkedIn message personalization \n  * Automated research of 40+ data sources, including podcasts, interviews, articles, blogs, case studies, job bios, social media posts, reviews, and awards \n  * Automated follow-ups and email verification \n  * Web analytics tracking \n\nIf you're in sales, marketing, or really any role that involves a lot of outbound messaging, SmartWriter is an AI email assistant you'll want in your toolkit. \n\nIts core functionality revolves around automating the creation of highly personalized cold emails and LinkedIn messages that actually convert.\n\nUsing AI and machine learning, SmartWriter analyzes data from a prospect's online profiles to generate tailored icebreakers and content that speaks directly to their interests and pain points. \n\nThis degree of personalization is incredibly powerful for cutting through the noise and capturing attention.\n\n[Image 10: SmartWriter personalized message examples] (【48†Image Source†www.smartwriter.ai】) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nI've spent way too much time manually crafting personalized cold emails in the past, I can't overstate how much of a time-saver SmartWriter is. \n\nBeing able to generate dozens of tailored icebreakers with just a few clicks is a game-changer for outbound campaigns.\n\nI'm also a big fan of SmartWriter's automated follow-up capabilities. \n\nThe tool can intelligently generate and send customized follow-up emails to any leads that don't respond initially. \n\nThis ensures no opportunities slip through the cracks.\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile SmartWriter's AI-generated content is impressively personalized, it's not perfect. \n\nOccasionally, the suggestions can miss the mark or feel a bit generic – especially for niche industries or highly technical subject matter. \n\nA fair bit of manual editing and quality control is still required.\n\nSmartWriter is also a fairly pricey solution, with even the basic plan starting at $59/month. \n\nThis may put it out of reach for smaller teams, freelancers, or those on tight budgets.\n\n#### SmartWriter pricing (billed annually)\n\nBasic plan: $49 per month \n\nPopular plan: $124 per month \n\nPro plan: $299 per month \n\nTry SmartWriter's 7-day free trial of its paid plans, no credit card required.\n\n  CTA Template\n\nNever miss another deadline with Motion\n\nSign up now to get started\n\n【23†Get Started†app.usemotion.com】 \n\n### Sa‎neBox: Best AI email assistant for inbox management and prioritization \n\n#### Available on \n\n  * Everywhere you check email \n\n#### Standout features \n\n  * AI-powered inbox sorting and prioritization \n  * Automated unsubscribe and \"SaneBlackHole\" for unwanted senders \n  * Reminders, follow-up tracking, and email snoozing \n  * Integrates seamlessly with Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients \n\nIf your inbox is a source of constant stress and overwhelm, SaneBox could be the AI email assistant you need to regain control. \n\nThis powerful tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically sort, prioritize, and filter your emails based on importance.\n\nWith SaneBox, emails from key clients, colleagues, and contacts get surfaced to the top of your inbox, while low-priority messages like newsletters and notifications get neatly tucked away in dedicated folders. \n\nYou can even set up rules to automatically unsubscribe or blackhole unwanted senders entirely.\n\n[Image 11: SaneBox email follow-up] (【49†Image Source†www.sanebox.com】) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nFor me, the biggest selling point of SaneBox is the sheer amount of time and mental energy it saves. \n\nNo more wading through an endless stream of clutter and noise to find the emails that actually matter. \n\nSaneBox handles all of that automatically, allowing me to focus on the high-impact tasks and messages.\n\nI'm also a big fan of SaneBox's email tracking and reminder capabilities. \n\nThe tool keeps tabs on all emails that need follow-ups or responses, ensuring nothing important gets overlooked or forgotten. \n\nYou can even set up custom snooze times for emails you want to deal with later.\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile SaneBox is incredibly useful once set up, getting there does require some initial time investment. \n\nYou'll need to train the AI on your preferences and make manual corrections early on to ensure emails are being properly categorized. \n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve involved.\n\n#### SaneBox pricing \n\nAppetizer plan: $0.07 daily or $24 annually \n\nSnack plan: $7 monthly, $59 annually + 3 months free, or $99 biannually + 9 months free \n\nLunch plan: $12 monthly, $99 annually + 3 months free, or $169 biannually + 9 months free \n\nD",

Your emails are private, so adding an app like this to your collection shouldn't represent a security risk. I read the privacy policy of each app to understand how secure your data will be.\n\nFor two weeks, I dug the internet for all the AI email assistants that I could find. I filtered out those that just integrated generative AI into the compose window and was left with a smaller selection. I signed up for each of them, configured the platform until it was ready to use, and sent a few emails back and forth between my email accounts. I played with the settings, observed how well the AI did what I wanted it to, and from there, picked these apps.\n\n## The best AI email assistants at a glance\n\nBest for \n\nStandout features \n\nPricing  \n\nShortwave \n\nSearch \n\nFlexible AI assistants; deep integration with Google Calendar \n\nFrom $8.50/user/month  \n\nMicrosoft Copilot Pro for Outlook \n\nImproving communication \n\nAlso unlocks features in other Microsoft apps \n\nMicrosoft 365 subscription required, starting at $9.99/ month; AI features $20/month  \n\nSuperhuman \n\nMixing AI generation with message templates \n\nLots of great keyboard shortcuts\n\n$30/user/month  \n\nSaneBox \n\nKeeping your inbox organized \n\nExcellent priority-focused categorization \n\nStarting from $0.07/day or $24/year  \n\nMailbutler \n\nGathering contact details and tasks \n\nExtracts data from email signatures; identifies tasks and integrates with task management apps \n\nStarting from $14.95/month for AI features   \n\n* * *\n\n## Best AI email assistant for searching email history\n\n### 【102†Shortwave†www.shortwave.com】 (Web, Android, iOS)\n\n[Image 3: Shortwave, our pick for the best AI email assistant for searching email history]\n\nShortwave pros:\n\n  * Deep integration with Google Calendar \n\n  * AI assistant is very flexible \n\nShortwave cons:\n\n  * Interface feels cluttered at times \n\nSitting confidently on the throne here, Shortwave has the widest range of AI features of all the apps on this list. They all live in the top-right of your screen: click on the magic stars icon there, and a chat window appears docked on the right side. This is the Shortwave AI Assistant.\n\nThe most unique possibility it offers is AI-powered email search. You can ask questions to your inbox to surface old, forgotten conversations without actually having to get lost in the mess. More than this, it can extract data from email threads (\"make a list of all the tasks in the website redesign project\"), generate content (\"write a tweet based on my emails about productivity\"), or answer your questions ChatGPT-style.\n\nEmail and calendars usually go hand in hand. In Shortwave, you can schedule meetings or new events in natural language, with something as simple as \"schedule a meeting for me and John in 2 days at 6pm.\" I used this exact prompt, and the meeting appeared on my calendar. I didn't have to do anything else. And if you don't know your availability, just ask, and you'll get a breakdown of your open slots for the near future.\n\nThe bulk of these AI features live in the sidebar, but you can see them in the email interface as well—look for the magic stars. While opening an email, look under the subject: you'll see a short generated summary of the thread. If you click on it, it'll work on a longer, more thorough version. A real time-saver if there's a lot of back and forth or multiple people involved in the conversation.\n\nAnd then, on the right side of where you write your replies, there are the magic stars again: you can generate a message from scratch or based on a prompt. This takes the action back to the sidebar, but you can easily add the AI output to a new reply and keep the conversation flowing.\n\nA bit of disappointing news: Shortwave only works with Gmail accounts for the time being, so if you're doing email with other providers, you'll have to sit out. Here's hoping it'll integrate with more inboxes in the future.\n\nShortwave price: Personal starts at $8.50/user/month \n\n## Best AI email assistant for improving communication\n\n### 【103†Microsoft Copilot Pro for Outlook†www.microsoft.com】 (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS)\n\n[Image 4: Microsoft Copilot Pro for Outlook, our pick for the best AI email assistant for improving communication]\n\nCopilot Pro for Outlook pros:\n\n  * OpenAI's GPT-4 available \n\n  * Also unlocks AI features in your other Office apps \n\nCopilot Pro for Outlook cons:\n\n  * No integration with non-Microsoft email inboxes \n\nMicrosoft's AI expansion continues with the release of Copilot Pro. Outlook is one of the apps that gets a boost, with three shiny AI features that, while not groundbreaking, are really well-implemented and easy to use. And, since we're talking about a tech giant, this list could expand quickly.\n\nThe first one is straightforward: you can write emails from scratch using AI. When writing a new email, look to the right half of the toolbar, click on the Copilot icon, and select Draft with Copilot. That will open the settings, where you can type your prompt, set the tone and length, and then start generating.\n\nThe second one is thread summarization: like others on this list, you can get a big-picture view of a conversation in a list of topics. Unlike others on this list, Copilot adds little numbers in superscript that you can use to jump to the message where that topic is discussed. Super helpful for searching your conversations for specific statements.\n\nBut the last one really surprised me. Called Coaching by Copilot, you can have your email message analyzed to see how the tone, content, and structure of the email will impact the receiver. I wrote a general project kickoff email to test this, and it told me I could be more enthusiastic, show appreciation for the reader's contribution, and break down the topics for higher clarity. This comes with a few example sentences, so you know how to take the first steps. A well-written email can save you a lot of headaches along the way, so I find this very helpful to manage projects, provide updates, and make communication more effective.\n\nOutlook wraps it up with a nice touch: if you generate an email with AI and click to send right away, it'll show a pop-up reminding you that AI may be inaccurate, inviting you to revisit the content before pushing it out. \n\nAnd, of course, this isn't the only place where you'll be getting AI. You'll also get 【104†Copilot features】 to help write documents in Word, generate presentations in PowerPoint, and analyze data in Excel. Plus, you can 【105†integrate Microsoft Outlook with Zapier】 to connect it to all the other apps you use at work. Learn more about 【106†how to automate Outlook】, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\n### Create tasks in Microsoft To-Do from new Microsoft Outlook emails\n\n【107†Create tasks in Microsoft To-Do from new Microsoft Outlook emails】\n\n【107†Try it .css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24{display:inline-block;fill:currentColor;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24 >svg{display:block;height:inherit;width:inherit;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24 *{fill:inherit;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24[class]{transition-property:fill;transition-timing-function:ease-in-out;transition-duration:300ms;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24[class]{display:block;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24[class]{height:24px;width:24px;}】\n\n  * [Image 5: Microsoft Outlook logo]\n  * [Image 6: Microsoft To Do logo]\n\nMicrosoft Outlook, Microsoft To Do\n\nMicrosoft Outlook + Microsoft To Do\n\n### Send emails in Microsoft Outlook for new items in Notion databases\n\n【108†Send emails in Microsoft Outlook for new items in Notion databases】\n\n【108†Try it .css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24{display:inline-block;fill:currentColor;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24 >svg{display:block;height:inherit;width:inherit;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24 *{fill:inherit;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24[class]{transition-property:fill;transition-timing-function:ease-in-out;transition-duration:300ms;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24[class]{display:block;}.css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate--block--24x24[class]{height:24px;width:24px;}】\n\n  * [Image 7: Notion logo]\n  * [Image 8: Microsoft Outlook logo]\n\nNotion, Microsoft Outlook\n\nNotion + Microsoft Outlook\n\n### Dispatch emails in Microsoft Outlook with new leads in Facebook Lead Ads\n\n【109†Dispatch emails in Microsoft Outlook with new leads in Facebook Lead Ads】\n\n【109†Try it .css-g369j7-Icon--arrowBigRight--animate",
