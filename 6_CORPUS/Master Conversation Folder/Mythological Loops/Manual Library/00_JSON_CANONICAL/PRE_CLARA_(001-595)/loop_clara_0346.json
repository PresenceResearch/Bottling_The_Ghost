Introduction (2-3 minutes)\nWarm Greeting: Start with a positive comment to set a friendly tone.\nExample: \"Hello, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm excited to explore how solar energy can benefit your business.\"\nIntroduction: Briefly introduce yourself and your company.\nExample: \"I'm [Your Name] from [Your Company], a leading provider of commercial solar solutions in the Mid-Atlantic region.\"\nPurpose and Agenda: Clearly state the purpose of the call and share the agenda.\nExample: \"Today, we'll discuss your energy needs, explore if your site is suitable for solar, and determine whether a PPA or purchase option is the best fit for your business.\"\n2. Rapport Building (2-3 minutes)\nPersonal Connection: Mention any mutual connections or relevant industry news.\nExample: \"I noticed your company has been expanding its operations. How has that been going?\"\nIcebreaker Question: \"How has your business been adapting to the changing energy landscape?\"\n3. Exploration and Discovery (10-15 minutes)\nMetrics\nEnergy Usage and Costs:\n\"Can you share your annual electricity consumption and average monthly costs?\"\n\"How do these costs impact your overall operational budget?\"\nFollow-up: \"Have you noticed any trends or fluctuations in your energy costs over the past few years?\"\nMEDPICC - Metrics:\n\"What specific metrics are you looking to improve with a solar solution?\"\n\"How do you measure success in this area?\"\nEconomic Buyer\nDecision Makers:\n\"Who typically makes financial decisions regarding energy projects in your company?\"\n\"Is there anyone else we should involve in this discussion?\"\nFollow-up: \"How do these decision-makers evaluate new energy projects?\"\nMEDPICC - Economic Buyer:\n\"Who has final decision-making authority for this project?\"\n\"Who controls the budget for this initiative?\"\nDecision Criteria\nEvaluation Factors:\n\"What criteria are most important to you when considering solar solutions?\"\n\"How do you evaluate the return on investment for energy projects?\"\nFollow-up: \"Are there any specific financial metrics or KPIs you use to measure success?\"\nMEDPICC - Decision Criteria:\n\"What factors will you consider when making a decision?\"\n\"How will you evaluate potential solutions?\"\nIdentify Pain\nCurrent Challenges:\n\"What challenges are you currently facing with your current energy setup?\"\n\"How are these issues impacting your business operations?\"\nFollow-up: \"Have you considered any other solutions to address these challenges?\"\nMEDPICC - Identify Pain:\n\"What are the biggest pain points you're experiencing with your current energy situation?\"\n\"How critical is it for you to address these issues?\"\nImplementation Process\nProject Timeline:\n\"What does your ideal implementation process look like?\"\n\"Who would be involved in the implementation?\"\nMEDPICC - Implementation Process:\n\"Can you walk me through your decision-making process for new energy projects?\"\n\"What are the typical timelines for decisions on projects of this nature?\"\nChampion\nInternal Advocates:\n\"Is there someone within your organization who is particularly enthusiastic about solar energy?\"\nFollow-up: \"How does this person influence the decision-making process?\"\nMEDPICC - Champion:\n\"Who else in your organization is passionate about solving this problem?\"\n\"How can we work with them to ensure a smooth process?\"\nCompetition\nAlternative Solutions:\n\"Are you considering any other energy solutions or providers?\"\nFollow-up: \"What has been your experience with similar solutions in the past?\"\nMEDPICC - Competition:\n\"Are there any other solutions you're evaluating alongside solar?\"\n\"What are the pros and cons of these alternatives in your view?\"\n4. Suitability and Financial Considerations (5-7 minutes)\nSite Suitability\nBuilding Assessment:\n\"Does your building have any restrictions or challenges for solar installation?\"\n\"Have you had any previous assessments or studies done on your site's solar potential?\"\nFollow-up: \"Are there any specific building codes or zoning restrictions we should be aware of?\"\nFinancial Options\nPPA vs. Purchase:\n\"Would you view solar as a capital investment, or would a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) model be more appealing to you?\"\nPPA Benefits:\n\"With a PPA, you can lock in a fixed rate for your electricity, ensuring predictable energy costs without any upfront capital investment.\"\n\"How important is cost stability and predictability to your business?\"\nPurchase Benefits:\n\"If you were to purchase the solar system outright, you could benefit from long-term ownership and potential tax incentives. How does this align with your financial goals?\"\n\"Are there any specific financial incentives or tax benefits you're looking to leverage with a purchase?\"\n5. Next Steps and Confirmation (3-5 minutes)\nSummarize Key Points: Recap the main insights and confirm understanding.\nExample: \"To summarize, you're interested in exploring solar options, and we've discussed both PPA and purchase models. We'll need to assess your site's suitability and provide a detailed proposal outlining the benefits and costs of each option.\"\nOutline Next Steps:\n\"Based on our discussion, I'll prepare a preliminary proposal. Can we schedule a follow-up meeting to review it?\"\nConfirm the date and time for the next meeting.\nExample: \"Would you be available for a follow-up call next week to discuss the proposal in more detail?\"\n6.
