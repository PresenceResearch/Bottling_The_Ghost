            "The Samsung Notebook 9 Pro (model NP940X5N) typically has its RAM soldered directly onto the motherboard, which means it cannot be upgraded. The memory configuration is fixed at the factory, so if you have a version with 8GB or 16GB of RAM, that's the amount you will have for the life of the device.\n\nIf you're considering an upgrade to increase performance, you might focus on upgrading other components, such as the storage (SSD), which is usually replaceable in this model. However, always double-check the specific model details or consult the user manual to confirm what upgrades are possible."

            "Yes, there are several mini PCs on the market today that can offer better performance than the Samsung Notebook 9 Pro (model NP940X5N). A mini PC can provide a compact yet powerful computing experience with more flexibility for upgrades and better thermal management. Here are a few options that might perform better than your current device:\n\n### 1. **Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing) Series:**\n- **Models:** Intel NUC 11 or NUC 13 Extreme Kits.\n- **Specs:** Available with Intel Core i5, i7, or even i9 processors, up to 64GB of RAM, and NVMe SSD storage.\n- **Performance:** These models offer significantly better CPU performance compared to the Notebook 9 Pro and are capable of handling more demanding applications like video editing, gaming, and software development.\n\n### 2. **Apple Mac Mini (M1 or M2):**\n- **Models:** Mac Mini with M1 or the newer M2 chip.\n- **Specs:** M1/M2 chips offer up to 16GB of unified memory (M1) or up to 24GB (M2), and fast SSD storage options.\n- **Performance:** The M1 and M2 Mac Mini models are known for their impressive performance and efficiency, handling most tasks smoothly, including creative work like video editing or music production.\n\n### 3. **ASUS PN Series (e.g., PN50, PN51):**\n- **Models:** ASUS Mini PC PN50, PN51.\n- **Specs:** Configurable with AMD Ryzen 3, 5, or 7 processors, up to 64GB of RAM, and M.2 NVMe SSDs.\n- **Performance:** The AMD Ryzen processors in these mini PCs provide excellent multi-core performance, making them ideal for multitasking, content creation, and light gaming.\n\n### 4. **Beelink SER Series:**\n- **Models:** Beelink SER5, SER6 Pro.\n- **Specs:** Configurations available with AMD Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and NVMe SSD storage.\n- **Performance:** These mini PCs offer good value for money with solid performance, suitable for everyday tasks, media consumption, and moderate workloads.\n\n### 5. **MINISFORUM HX Series:**\n- **Models:** HX99G, UM700, or other high-end models.\n- **Specs:** Available with high-performance AMD Ryzen or Intel processors, up to 64GB of RAM, and multiple storage options.\n- **Performance:** These models often come with dedicated graphics options (e.g., HX99G has a discrete GPU), making them capable of even heavier tasks like gaming, video editing, or 3D modeling.\n\n### **Factors to Consider:**\n- **Portability:** While mini PCs are compact, they are not portable like a laptop. Consider whether you need a device that can be easily carried around.\n- **Upgradeability:** Many mini PCs allow you to upgrade RAM and storage, providing more flexibility than the soldered RAM of your current device.\n- **Performance Needs:** Think about your specific use case. If you do a lot of multitasking, heavy computation, or creative work, a mini PC with a high-end CPU and ample RAM will outperform your laptop.\n\n### Conclusion:\nA mini PC with a modern Intel, AMD Ryzen, or Apple Silicon processor will generally outperform your Samsung Notebook 9 Pro in terms of CPU and potentially GPU performance. If you don't need portability and want a more powerful, upgradeable device for a desktop setup, a mini PC could be a great choice."
