The trio also brought in such talents as Charles Jacqueau and Jeanne Toussaint.\n\nOne of Cartier’s earliest major successes was the 【206†Santos de Cartier watch】 — one of the world's first modern 【87†wristwatches】 for men. (Previously, a large number of people were using only 【207†pocket watches】.) Louis designed the timepiece in 1904 for his friend, 【208†popular Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont】, who wanted to be able to check the time more easily while flying.\n\nCartier’s other famous timepieces include the 【209†Tank watch】, which was inspired by the linear form of military tanks during World War I, and the so-called 【210†mystery clocks】. Invented by watchmaker and magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin and later crafted exclusively for Cartier in the house’s workshop by watchmaker Maurice Couët, the mystery clocks were so named because the integration of glass dials on which the clocks’ hands would seemingly float as well as structures that are hidden away within the base give the illusion that they operate without machinery.\n\nOn the jewelry side of the business, Cartier’s internationally renowned offerings include the 【211†Tutti Frutti collection】, which featured colorful carved gemstones inspired by Jacques’s trip to India and grew in popularity 【212†during the Art Deco years】; the 【213†panthère】 motif, which has been 【214†incorporated into everything】 from 【215†brooches】 to rings; and the 【98†Love bracelet】, a minimal, modernist locking bangle 【216†inspired by medieval chastity belts】 that 【217†transformed fine jewelry】.\n\nWhile the Cartier family sold the business following the death of Pierre in 1964, the brand continues to innovate today, renewing old hits and creating new masterpieces.\n\nFind contemporary and vintage Cartier watches, 【218†engagement rings】, 【219†necklaces】 and other accessories on 1stDibs.\n\nAbout the Seller \n\n5.0 \n\n1 Review \n\nLocated in London, United Kingdom \n\nVetted Seller \n\nThese experienced sellers undergo a comprehensive evaluation by our team of in-house experts.\n\nEstablished in 2012 \n\n1stDibs seller since 2023 \n\nTypical response time: 3 hours \n\n  * Shipping\n\nRetrieving quote...\n\nShips From: London, United Kingdom \n\n  * Return Policy \n\nA return for this item may be initiated within 7 days of delivery.\n\nSee Details \n\nMore From This Seller View All \n\n  * Cartier Ronde Solo de Cartier W6701004 \n\nBy Cartier \n\nLocated in London, GB \n\nClassic Cartier with a twist, the Black Roman Numeral hour markers a signature of Cartier in a lesser case being a 29.5mm steel round case known as the 'Ronde Solo' one of the more modern designs to be released by Cartier.

            "The original Cartier box can add significant value to a watch, particularly if it is in good condition and accompanied by other original accessories such as papers, manuals, or certificates. For collectible watches, like those from Cartier, having the original box can increase the watch's resale value by anywhere from 10% to 20%, depending on the watch's overall rarity and desirability.\n\nBuyers often view the original packaging as a sign that the watch has been well cared for and maintained, which can make the item more appealing and valuable in the eyes of collectors and enthusiasts. For instance, a Cartier Must de Cartier 21 with the original box and papers might sell for a few hundred dollars more compared to a similar model without these extras.\n\nIf you are considering selling or valuing this watch, including the box in your listing could help attract more potential buyers and justify a higher asking price."
