Fortunately, there are deals on nearly every streaming service out there, especially when it comes to opting in for an annual plan or bundling multiple services together. Below, we've highlighted all of the best streaming deals and bundles, from Disney to Amazon and everything in between.\n\nWhile many of these deals are standard, year-round offerings, we'll keep this page updated to include limited-time-only sales so that you'll never miss out on potential savings. This month, we've found some special deals at Paramount+ right in time for the start of the NFL season.\n\nCheck out each streaming service's currently available deals below. We've highlighted both standard streaming services and live TV packages, with price comparisons to how much you'd pay per year with a month-to-month plan or how much you'd pay per month without bundling multiple services together. Many of the streamers offer introductory deals, which we've also outlined.\n\n## Paramount+\n\nThere are always year-round savings with Paramount+ annual plans compared to paying month-to-month (Essential plans go for $7.99/month, and the With Showtime tier costs $13.99/month), but there's an even stronger deal right now. You can get 50% off of the annual plan, which already offers savings, using the code FALL50. This is a limited-time-only offer available until September 23, and we've broken down exactly what a subscription entails in 【107†our guide】.\n\n【108† †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【108† Paramount Plus Essential (Annual Plan) †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【108†$29.99†affiliate.insider.com】 $95.88 Save 69%\n\nUsers can get major savings on an annual subscription for the next couple of weeks using the promo code FALL50. This will give you a year's worth of CBS and Paramount original on-demand, along with live access to the NFL on CBS. \n\n【108† View at Paramount Plus †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【108† †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【108† Paramount Plus with Showtime Annual Plan †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【108†$59.99†affiliate.insider.com】 $155.88 Save 62%\n\nFrom now until September 23, subscribers can get a year of Paramount Plus with Showtime for 50% off the normal annual plan and more than half-off what they'd pay month-to-month each year. This tier means that you can access on-demand content ad-free, as well as CBS live streams. \n\n【108† View at Paramount Plus †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\nIf you just want to stick with a monthly plan, you can head to the 【109†Paramount+ website†affiliate.insider.com】.\n\n## ESPN+\n\nESPN+ goes for $10.99 a month, so an annual plan offers some savings if you're planning to keep your subscription for a year. The streaming service is best known for its UFC pay-per-view (PPV) events, which require a subscription and an additional PPV fee. The bundle below offers further discounts when you combine an annual subscription with a PPV purchase. \n\n【110† †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【110† ESPN+ Annual †affiliate.insider.com】 \n\n【110†$109.99†affiliate.insider.com】 $131.88 Save 17%\n\nGet a year's access to ESPN+ for the cost of 10 months.

          "text": "\nWith the Disney Bundle Trio Basic, you can combine Disney+ Basic (regularly $7.99 a month) with 【32†Hulu】 (basic version with ads, regularly $7.99 a month) and 【89†ESPN+】 (regularly $10.99 a month). That’s a $26.97 value for just $14.99 a month. You could upgrade your internet speed with the extra green. With all that streaming, you might need it.\n\nThere are several ways you can customize the Disney Bundle. If you’re not interested in ESPN+, you can get the Duo Basic, which only includes ad-supported versions of Hulu and Disney+, for $9.99 a month.\n\nIf you want to go all-out and do away with pesky ads, you can upgrade to Duo Premium, which bundles ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu for $19.99 a month. You can also add ad-supported ESPN+ to the bundle for a total of $24.99 a month. Unfortunately, you can’t bundle in an ad-free version of ESPN+.\n\nThere are also variations on this bundle that can save you money on ad-free Hulu or Hulu + Live TV—check out our 【90†Hulu Bundles guide】 for all the discount streaming deets.\n\n【58†View Disney+ plans†go.cabletv.com】\n\n## Best deal for live TV streaming: Sling TV with discounted first month\n\n【60† †go.cabletv.com】 \n\n【59†Editorial rating (3.7/5)】\n\nPrice:\n\n$40.00–$55.00/mo.\n\nFeature #1:\n\n30–45+ channels \n\nFeature #2:\n\nSave on your first month\n\n【60†View plans†go.cabletv.com】\n\n【31†Read full review】 \n\n#### Pro\n\n  * Free and discounted gear\n\n#### Con\n\n  * Limited local channels\n\n【31†Sling TV】 is one of the loudest voices in live TV streaming. But it doesn’t just advertise hard—it’s also willing to give you 【91†free stuff】 to cut that cable (or satellite beam).\n\nIf you prepay for 4 months of Sling TV Season Pass (which includes Sling’s Orange + Blue tier and the Sports Extra plan), you’ll save $92 and be able to stream both NFL and NCAA football games.\n\nFor a limited time, new Sling TV customers can enjoy half off their first month of Sling Blue, Orange, or Orange & Blue.\n\nGet a free month of Premium Pass when you select a Sling base service. With Premium Pass you’ll get access to Paramount+ with Showtime, AMC+, STARZ, and MGM+ with no contract required.\n\n【60†View Sling TV plans†go.cabletv.com】\n\n## Best deal for Apple fans: Free Apple TV+ with Apple product purchase\n\n【61† †go.cabletv.com】 \n\n【59†Editorial rating (4/5)】\n\nPrice:\n\nRegularly $9.99/mo.\n\nFeature #1:\n\nApple TV+ originals \n\nFeature #2:\n\nFree for 3 mos.\n\n【61†View plans†go.cabletv.com】\n\n【92†Read full review】 \n\n#### Pro\n\n  * Free Apple TV+\n\n#### Con\n\n  * Limited time offer\n\nApple lovers rarely need an excuse to visit an Apple Store, but not all of them are convinced that they should drop $9.99 a month on its content-loaded 【92†Apple TV+】 streaming service. Conundrum solved: purchase a new iPhone, MacBook, iPad, or Apple TV, and Apple will throw in three months of Apple TV+ at zero cost. Ultimately, that’s an annual savings of $29.97.\n\nWith it, you can check out Apple TV+ original series like Ted Lasso, Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet, and The Morning Show. When does Apple give away anything for free?\n\n【61†View Apple TV+ plans†go.cabletv.com】\n\n## Best Amazon Prime Video deal for students: Free and discounted Amazon Prime membership\n\n【59†Editorial rating (4/5)】\n\nPrice:\n\nFree (6 mos.)\n\nFeature #1:\n\nAccess to Prime Video \n\nFeature #2:\n\n$7.49/mo. (or $69.00/yr.) after trial\n\n【62†View plans †www.amazon.com】 \n\n【37†Read full review】 \n\n#### Pro\n\n  * 12 months of free Amazon Prime membership\n\n#### Con\n\n  * Limited availability\n\nAmazon’s Prime Student program offers a free six-month trial of Prime membership for higher education students, and a discounted rate of $7.49 a month (or $69.00 a year—you save even more money by paying for 12 months in advance) after the trial. This also gives you access to 【37†Prime Video】 at no extra charge.\n\nAfter four years, or the end of your college studies, whichever comes first, your Prime membership will revert to its standard rate: $14.99 a month, or $139.00 a year.\n\n【62†Amazon Prime plans†www.amazon.com】\n\n## Best Hulu deal for students: Discounted basic plan\n\n【63† †go.cabletv.com】 \n\n【59†Editorial rating (3.2/5)】\n\nPrice:\n\n$1.99/mo.\n\nFeature #1:\n\nAccess to basic Hulu \n\nFeature #2:\n\nSavings of $6 a month\n\n【63†View plans †go.cabletv.com】 \n\n【32†Read full review】 \n\n#### Pro\n\n  * 75% monthly savings\n\n#### Con\n\n  * Not available for all colleges\n\nCollege students 18 and over can subscribe to 【32†Hulu】’s basic, ad-supported plan for just $1.99 a month, a huge savings over the usual $7.99 a month.\n\nTo be eligible, you’ll need to be verified as a student through Sheer ID. The deal isn’t available to all colleges, and it’s only active for the time you’re a verifiable student.\n\n【63†View Hulu plans†go.cabletv.com】\n\n## What to look for in streaming TV packages and deals\n\nBefore you sign up for that deal, check into these details first:\n\n### How long the deal lasts\n\nOnce your deal’s time is up, you’ll be charged the regular rate for the service. The Disney+ bundle has no expiration date (yet), but some plans are limited time only—after which, you’ll be charged the normal price each month.\n\n### Hidden fees\n\nSometimes a provider will sneak in some extra fees that can eat into your overall savings. It’s a strain on the eyes, but always read the fine print before you sign up.\n\n### Current customer eligibility\n\nMost of the deals we’ve covered here are aimed at new customers as an incentive to sign up, but current customers can sometimes get in on them too. If you’re a customer in good standing with your provider, contact customer service and simply ask if you can take advantage of the same offer as a new customer. In most cases, they’ll work with you to keep you as customer.\n\n## What are the best streaming TV deals?\n\nThe 【58†Disney",

But there's always one or two standout deals.\n\nIn the US, the 【63†Disney Bundle】 (Hulu, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus) is a great option for people who want all three services. The cost, $13.99, is less than you'd pay for any two of the services and gets you a third totally free as well.\n\nIn the UK, it's usually mobile operator bundles that offer the best deals, so when you're buying a new phone contract, you can often use that to get yourself cheap streaming service subscriptions.\n\n### When do the best streaming deals take place?\n\nSome deals, like bundles and trials, roll all year round. But others only pop up sporadically.\n\nA great time to look for streaming service deals is around Black Friday, which in 2022 falls on Friday 25 November. In previous years, we've seen great discounts on Disney Plus, AMC Plus, Discovery Plus, Hulu and a fair few Prime Video channels.\n\nCertain companies have special 'days' too, like 【64†Disney Plus Day】 and Amazon Prime Day, and we often see discounts on the corresponding services for a limited time.\n\n### What makes a good streaming deal?\n\nWhen streaming services were new, each offered plenty of deals to try and get you to try this new-fangled way of watching TV. That's not the case anymore, and actual discounts on streaming services are few and far between.\n\nSo a \"good deal\" on a streaming service can be anything that lets you save money, but the most common we see are bundles, that group multiple services in for a lower price. As long as you want all the services, this is a good way to save.\n\nThe best deals are the straight-up discounts though, especially on annual subscriptions, as they save you the most amount of cash (as monthly deals only reduce one month's bill).\n\nToday's best Netflix, Apple TV plus, Amazon Prime, Paramount Plus, HBO Max, Disney+ and Hulu deals\n\n[Image 13: Netflix]\n\n【65†Netflix - Standard with ads†www.anrdoezrs.net】\n\n【65† $6.99 /mth†www.anrdoezrs.net】\n\n【65†View Deal†www.an",

            "Currently, there aren't many specific bundled packages directly offering Max (formerly HBO Max) with other streaming services. However, there are a few indirect ways you might get a Max subscription bundled or at a discounted rate:\n\n1. **AT&T Wireless and Internet Plans**: Some AT&T customers can get Max included for free with select wireless, internet, and TV plans. This is a common perk that has been offered for some time, so if you're an AT&T customer or considering switching, it's worth checking if your plan includes Max.\n\n2. **Certain Cable or Satellite TV Providers**: Some cable and satellite providers, like DirecTV and Comcast, may offer Max as part of their premium packages. These bundles can often include other premium networks (like STARZ, Showtime, and Cinemax) along with Max.\n\n3. **Bundles with Streaming Devices**: Occasionally, there are promotions where you can get a Max subscription when you purchase a certain streaming device, like a Roku or Apple TV, though this tends to vary by retailer and specific promotions.\n\n4. **Discovery+ and Max Merge Plan**: Since Max includes Discovery's content, the plan effectively bundles Discovery+ and Max content together, but it's not offered as a separate service bundle at this time. However, you get access to both libraries if you subscribe to Max's Ultimate Ad-Free plan.\n\n5. **Add-Ons Through Other Services**: You can often add Max as a premium channel through services like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, or YouTube TV, which might occasionally offer introductory discounts or special deals on the Max subscription.\n\nWhile there aren't direct bundled packages with Max and other streaming services currently available, keeping an eye on promotions from your wireless provider, cable service, or streaming device retailer could offer a way to get Max at a discounted rate or as part of a bundle."
