I’ve worked with them to find employment opportunities that align with their skills and experience while also assisting them in acclimating to their new lives in the U.S. and navigating the necessary bureaucracy. My focus has been on fostering self-reliance and building their confidence to manage their new environment independently. As a result, they are now thriving, living independent lives, and contributing to their communities."
