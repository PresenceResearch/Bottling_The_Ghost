Do a google search - there is nothing there specifically targeted at panel repairs.\r\nR&R (Remove and Replace) - Existing\r\nDirect to Consumer prior to roof repair / replacement\r\nPartner with roofing companies who can white label our services as part of their package \r\nR&R Upgrade\r\nThis was discussed in the meeting\r\nRemove and upgrade system\r\nAdd battery to existing system \r\nSell annual maintenance plan \r\nR&R (Remove and Recycle)\r\nComplete removal and recycling of existing system\r\nC&I - New Business\r\n Bundle with new contracts - I have a concept built with Andrew for this.  It's good.\r\nC&I - Existing / Installed Projects\r\n Offer to existing installs (except the ones we don't want to offer to)..\r\nC&I - Existing / Non-Lumina\r\nProjects installed by defunct or non-responsive EPC's who can or will not perform service calls\r\nSmaller portfolio owners (Wynn etc)\r\nLarge asset owners (Brookfield, Sol, Summit Ridge)\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nShane Williams should not be in commercial sales.  He is unable or unwilling to develop new business and is still not an effective salesperson.  If Shane were to come in as an external candidate interviewing for this position, I would not hire him.  His counterpart, Phil Jordan, has shown what can be done if proper effort has been expended (please note that at least half of Shane's opportunities have not been recently updated to reflect a closed/lost status).  \r\n\r\nWith proper guidance, Shane could add value to Energy Services' business development efforts. I recommend placing him in a role focusing on the residential portion, potentially partnering with inside sales and marketing for outreach.  Shane's strengths lie in the B2C space, and this role would utilize these strengths much more effectively than his current role.\r\n\r\nMark Manthy would serve as an advisor to Andrew Logan in setup and execution of this program.  Mark would also leverage his experience, network, and skillset to organically develop C&I business.  \r\n\r\nStakeholders\r\n\r\nColin Gload - is currently serving as the executive responsible for Energy Services.  Any changes will need to be approved by him.  Colin will also be responsible for developing an appropriate comp plan.\r\n\r\nAndrew Logan - As Director of Energy Services, Andrew will need to agree to this proposal and dedicate resources to it's successful development and execution.\r\n\r\nJames Yim will need to approve the potential additional expense of a new role.  Should Shane be approved for this role, his existing salary will be transferred to the ES budget, however, I recommend that the base salary for this role be independently evaluated.\r\n\r\nMike Kirby will need to approve the role, expense, and overall concept. Mike will ultimately approve or reject it.\r"

            "### To: Michael Kirby, CEO, Lumina Solar  \n### From: [Your Name]  \n### Date: [Insert Date]  \n### Subject: Proposal for Bifurcating Energy Services into Residential and Commercial & Industrial (C&I) Vertical Segments\n\n---\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThis memo outlines a proposal to bifurcate Lumina Solar’s Energy Services into two distinct verticals: **Residential** and **Commercial & Industrial (C&I)**. This division aims to create specialized focus areas, allowing for greater efficiency, improved customer service, and new revenue streams.\n\n---\n\n### **Vision for Bifurcation:**\n\nThe proposal suggests creating separate verticals for **Residential** and **C&I** Energy Services, with the following focus areas:\n\n#### **Residential Services:**\n\n1. **General Service Calls and Repairs:**  \n   There is a significant gap in the market for panel-specific repair services. A Google search reveals little competition in this space, presenting an opportunity for Lumina to capture unmet demand.\n\n2. **Remove and Replace (R&R) - Existing Systems:**  \n   - Direct-to-consumer outreach for roof repair or replacement before the solar system is impacted.\n   - Establish partnerships with roofing companies who can white-label Lumina’s services as part of their package.\n  \n3. **R&R Upgrade Opportunities:**\n   - Removal and upgrade of existing systems to enhance efficiency.\n   - Addition of battery storage systems to existing installations.\n   - Development and sale of annual maintenance plans for long-term service relationships.\n\n4. **R&R (Remove and Recycle):**  \n   Offer complete removal and recycling services for obsolete or unwanted systems, promoting sustainability and responsible disposal.\n\n#### **C&I - New Business Opportunities:**\n\n1. **Bundling Energy Services with New Contracts:**  \n   A concept developed in collaboration with Andrew Logan will bundle Energy Services with new C&I contracts. Initial feedback is positive, and this has strong potential.\n\n2. **C&I - Existing/Installed Projects:**  \n   - Offer service contracts to existing Lumina-installed projects, excluding those where we do not wish to provide ongoing support.\n  \n3. **C&I - Existing/Non-Lumina Installations:**  \n   - Target projects that were installed by now-defunct or non-responsive EPCs.\n   - Focus on providing services to smaller portfolio owners (e.g., Wynn) and large asset owners (e.g., Brookfield, Sol, Summit Ridge) who may have maintenance needs for aging systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Personnel Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Shane Williams:**  \n   Shane has been underperforming in his current role within commercial sales, showing a reluctance or inability to develop new business. Based on his performance, if Shane were an external candidate, he would not meet the hiring standards for his current role. In contrast, Phil Jordan has demonstrated what is possible with proper effort and focus.\n\n   **Recommendation:**  \n   Shane would be better suited to a role within the Residential Energy Services team, potentially partnering with inside sales and marketing for outreach. His strengths lie in B2C sales, where he could provide more value.\n\n2. **Mark Manthy:**  \n   Mark should serve as an advisor to Andrew Logan in setting up and executing this bifurcation. His expertise, network, and skillset will also help to develop organic C&I business opportunities.\n\n---\n\n### **Stakeholders and Approval Process:**\n\n1. **Colin Gload:**  \n   As the executive responsible for Energy Services, Colin will need to approve the proposed changes and develop a suitable compensation plan for Shane's new role.\n\n2. **Andrew Logan:**  \n   Andrew, as Director of Energy Services, will need to approve and allocate resources to ensure the successful implementation of this plan.\n\n3. **James Yim:**  \n   James will need to evaluate and approve any potential additional expenses for the new role, including a review of Shane's current salary, which will transfer to the Energy Services budget if the role is approved. The base salary for this role should be evaluated independently.\n\n4. **Michael Kirby:**  \n   You, as CEO, will need to provide final approval for the role, its associated expenses, and the overall bifurcation concept.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe proposed bifurcation of Lumina’s Energy Services into Residential and C&I verticals offers significant growth potential and a more focused approach to serving each market's distinct needs. By optimizing personnel roles and building targeted service offerings, Lumina can capture new business while improving operational efficiency. Your approval is requested to move forward with this proposal.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you require any further details or adjustments to this proposal.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  "

            "### To: Michael Kirby, CEO, Lumina Solar  \n### From: [Your Name]  \n### Date: [Insert Date]  \n### Subject: Proposal to Add Business Development and Sales Associate to Energy Services Division\n\n---\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThis memo outlines a proposal to add a **Business Development and Sales Associate** to Lumina Solar's Energy Services Division. This role is critical to expanding our capabilities in both the **Residential** and **Commercial & Industrial (C&I)** sectors. The goal is to create a dedicated focus on driving new business while supporting the successful execution of existing projects.\n\n---\n\n### **Business Rationale:**\n\nThe Energy Services Division is primed for growth in both **Residential** and **C&I** verticals. However, to capture this opportunity effectively, we need additional resources in business development and sales. A dedicated associate will help drive strategic partnerships, enhance service offerings, and improve outreach efforts in both sectors.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Responsibilities for the Business Development and Sales Associate:**\n\n#### **Residential Services:**\n\n1. **General Service Calls and Repairs:**  \n   Focus on addressing a gap in the market for solar panel-specific repair services. There is minimal competition for this niche, presenting an opportunity for Lumina to establish itself as a leader in this space.\n\n2. **Remove and Replace (R&R) - Existing Systems:**  \n   - Create direct-to-consumer strategies for targeting homeowners prior to roof repairs or replacements.\n   - Develop partnerships with roofing companies that can white-label our services as part of their roofing packages.\n\n3. **R&R Upgrade Opportunities:**  \n   - Lead efforts to upsell existing clients on system upgrades or battery storage solutions.\n   - Develop and sell annual maintenance plans, providing customers with ongoing support while ensuring a recurring revenue stream.\n\n4. **R&R (Remove and Recycle):**  \n   This new role will also focus on promoting the complete removal and recycling of outdated or unwanted systems, positioning Lumina as a leader in sustainable solar practices.\n\n#### **C&I - New Business Opportunities:**\n\n1. **Bundling Energy Services with New Contracts:**  \n   Work with Andrew Logan on a previously developed concept to bundle Energy Services with new C&I contracts, driving new business opportunities with our commercial clients.\n\n2. **C&I - Existing/Installed Projects:**  \n   Develop service offerings for existing Lumina-installed projects, excluding those we strategically choose not to support.\n\n3. **C&I - Existing/Non-Lumina Installations:**  \n   Target projects installed by now-defunct or non-responsive EPCs, focusing on providing services to smaller portfolio owners (e.g., Wynn) and larger asset owners (e.g., Brookfield, Sol, Summit Ridge) who need reliable service partners.\n\n---\n\n### **Personnel and Role Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Shane Williams:**  \n   Shane has been underperforming in his current commercial sales role, showing little interest in developing new business. In comparison, his colleague Phil Jordan has demonstrated the results that come from focused efforts.\n\n   **Recommendation:**  \n   We recommend moving Shane into a new role focusing on **Residential Energy Services**. He has shown strengths in B2C sales, and this role would allow him to work with inside sales and marketing to grow this vertical. His existing salary would transfer to the Energy Services budget.\n\n2. **Mark Manthy:**  \n   Mark will act as an advisor to Andrew Logan, supporting the business development and sales associate and leveraging his network to help build out our C&I business organically.\n\n---\n\n### **Stakeholders and Approval Process:**\n\n1. **Colin Gload:**  \n   Colin, as the executive responsible for Energy Services, will need to approve the role, including compensation and its integration into the team.\n\n2. **Andrew Logan:**  \n   As Director of Energy Services, Andrew will need to approve the role and allocate resources to ensure its successful execution.\n\n3. **James Yim:**  \n   James will need to approve the potential additional expense of this new role. Shane’s salary will transfer to the Energy Services budget, but a review and evaluation of the base salary for this position will be necessary.\n\n4. **Michael Kirby:**  \n   Your approval is needed for the creation of this role, the associated expenses, and the overall business development strategy proposed for Energy Services.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe addition of a Business Development and Sales Associate is essential to capitalizing on the growth potential within Lumina Solar’s Energy Services Division. This role will provide much-needed focus on generating new business and nurturing strategic partnerships in both Residential and C&I verticals. I respectfully request your approval to proceed with this proposal.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you require further details or have any questions.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  "
