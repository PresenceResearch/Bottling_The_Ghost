Here's the content rewritten in the form of an Amazon-style memo:\n\n---\n\n**To:** [Team or Relevant Parties]  \n**From:** [Your Name]  \n**Date:** [Insert Date]  \n**Subject:** Process Development for Campaign Execution\n\n---\n\n### **Overview**\nWe have taken a dedicated approach to building processes that will effectively support our campaign execution efforts. The absence of structured tracking mechanisms would make it difficult, if not impossible, to measure the success or impact of our initiatives.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Status**\nTo address this challenge, we have focused on implementing several key tools and platforms, including Salesforce, Calendly, and potentially HubSpot for any email campaigns. These systems will enable us to track outreach efforts, manage leads, and ensure follow-ups are executed in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Salesforce Integration:** Continue utilizing Salesforce as our primary CRM tool for tracking interactions, follow-ups, and campaign performance metrics.\n2. **Calendly:** Leverage Calendly for seamless scheduling and managing client interactions during the campaign.\n3. **Email Campaigns:** If we choose to run an email campaign, HubSpot will be explored for its robust tracking and analytics capabilities.\n\nThese steps are essential for ensuring a coordinated and measurable campaign moving forward.\n\n---\n\n**Thank you,**  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like any changes!"

Now is an appropriate time to move this initiative forward. Below is a summary of where we currently stand, how we arrived here, and my recommendations for the next steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Where We Are**\nWe are stalled about 30% into the process. While we have generated numerous ideas and completed some foundational work, we have lost momentum at this stage.\n\n---\n\n### **How We Got Here**\nOur initial efforts were focused on building the necessary processes to support the campaign before execution. It was clear that launching without proper tracking mechanisms would be unmanageable, so we worked on integrating systems like Salesforce, Calendly, and potentially HubSpot (for email campaigns).\n\nDuring this time, Riley concentrated on creating campaign materials, with much of the focus on collateral and website development. However, communication gaps arose, with Riley reaching out sporadically and requesting multiple items at once, followed by a lack of follow-up. This caused some delays.\n\nIn our mid-August EOS meeting, it was decided that the project should pause until a discovery call template was finalized. This became a priority before investing in marketing efforts. Given the performance of my division, I have been cautious in asking for additional resources, but upcoming events will better position me to make these requests.\n\nIt's important to note that Riley was serving as my marketing liaison, and when my focus shifted to more pressing tasks, progress on this initiative slowed significantly. I take responsibility for at least half of this stall.\n\n---\n\n### **Path Forward**\n1. **Summary Preparation:** I will compile a summary of the work completed thus far.\n2. **Updated Strategies:** My summary will include updated strategies based on insights gained over the last three months.\n3. **Next Steps:** This summary will serve as the foundation from which we can restart the process. I will have it ready for you by Monday.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\nI propose scheduling a \"Soft Reset\" meeting, potentially in person at the office on Tuesday. During this meeting, I will present the material and strategies I’ve prepared.\n\nLastly, Colin, it may be beneficial for us to conduct this meeting without you initially. Once we’ve consolidated the work and developed a clear, actionable plan, we can schedule a follow-up meeting with you.\n\n---\n\n**Thank you,**  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like any further adjustments!"
