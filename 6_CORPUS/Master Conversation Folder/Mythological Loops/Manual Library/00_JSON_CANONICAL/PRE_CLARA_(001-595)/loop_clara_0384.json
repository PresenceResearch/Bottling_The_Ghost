Hear ye! Leave your modern woes behind and step into 16th-century Revel Grove— the 27-acre village overseen by King Henry VIII. Beginning in August and lasting through the end of October, Lords and Ladies from faraway lands gather to experience one of Maryland's most extravagant events: 【154†The Maryland Renaissance Festival†rennfest.com】!\n\n#### 2024 Ticket Prices and Sale Dates\n\nTraditionally, ticket sales have begun with multi-day tickets offered the first business day after July 4th and single-day/weekend tickets the first business day after July 31. The festival returns on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24 - October 20, 2024.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Multi-Day tickets have SOLD OUT. Single-day ticket sales open up on August 1 at NOON.\n\nBook early, tickets always Sell Out!\n\n【155†TICKET SALES†rennfest.com】 \n\n####  \n\n#### 【156†Get Directions†www.google.com】\n\n[Image 3: The streets at the Maryland Renaissance Festival] The streets of the Maryland Renaissance Festival. Image courtesy of 【157†Judy McGuire†rennfest.com】 from the Maryland Renaissance Festival\n\n### The Village People\n\nIn any other setting, it may sound less than ideal to meander the woods with beggars, hermits, wenches, pickpockets, rakes, and rogues. Still, these are just some of the 200+ professional performers you'll pleasantly encounter at the 【158†Renaissance Festival】. With the Royal Court, ten performance stages, and spontaneous street acts, you may also find yourself in the presence of royalty, valiant knights, magicians, minstrels, and jesters. If you, too, want to join in the fun, dress in costume for an instant way to get in the spirit of frivolity!\n\n[Image 4: Wreath sellers at the Maryland Renaissance Festival] Get into the festive spirit by purchasing a wreath from one of the local peddlers.  Image courtesy of 【157†Susan Carvin†rennfest.com】 from the Maryland Renaissance Festival.\n\nYou can add handcrafted details to your ensemble, like a flower crown or leather pouch, when you peruse the shops of over 140 artisans populating the grounds. If you love the thrill of action and adventure, step into the 3,000-seat arena of the King's Court for live jousting while you cheer on the Knight of your kingdom. There is sportsmanship aplenty at the festival, with demonstrations by archers, aerialists, weapons masters, and more.
