Both PPA and C-PACE financing options help Maryland businesses transition to solar energy without financial strain, promoting sustainability and long-term savings.\n\n#### Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE)\n\n  * No Upfront Costs: Finance solar installations through property tax assessments.\n  * Preserve Capital: Use available funds for other business needs.\n  * Long-term Financing: Spread payments over a long period with low interest rates.\n  * Property-Linked Repayment: Loan repayment is tied to the property, not the business.\n\n#### Solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)\n\n  * No Upfront Costs: Install solar panels without any initial investment.\n  * Immediate Savings: Lower electricity bills from the start.\n  * Predictable Energy Costs: Lock in lower energy rates for the long term.\n  * No Maintenance Responsibilities: The solar provider handles system maintenance and performance.\n\n## Does Maryland Have Any Solar Incentives? \n\nYes, Maryland offers several incentives for companies looking to install commercial solar systems. \n\nHere are the key incentives available:\n\n### Maryland’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)\n\nBusinesses can benefit from 【53†Maryland’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) Program†www.psc.state.md.us】 by earning and selling Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) generated from renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass. This can create an additional revenue stream. \n\nThe program also encourages businesses to invest in renewable energy, leading to potential cost savings on energy bills and contributing to environmental sustainability. Compliance with RPS requirements can enhance a company’s reputation and support state-wide renewable energy goals.\n\n### Solar Sales Tax Exemption\n\nPurchases of solar equipment in Maryland are exempt from sales tax, which is applied at the point of purchase. This exemption is managed by the 【54†Comptroller of Maryland†www.marylandtaxes.gov】 and benefits all taxpayers within the state.\n\n### Maryland Solar Property & Use Tax Exemptions\n\nBusinesses in Maryland can benefit from the 【55†Renewable Energy System Property Tax Exemption†dat.maryland.gov】 by installing solar energy systems on their properties. This exemption eliminates the additional property tax typically incurred from the increased property value due to these installations on commercial property. The ongoing exemption provides significant long-term savings and incentivizes investment in renewable energy, enhancing sustainability and reducing operational costs.\n\n### Commercial Clean Energy Rebate Program (C-CERP)\n\n【56†The solar portion of the C-CERP†energy.maryland.gov】 will be replaced by the upcoming FY25 Commercial Solar Pilot Program (working name) to be launched in the Summer of 2024. The Maryland Energy Administration will publish more information later this year. This program offers rebates of up to $30,000 for commercial solar systems. Applications are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis until the budget is exhausted. \n\n### Maryland Energy Storage Income Tax Credit\n\nThe 【57†Maryland Energy Storage Income Tax Credit†energy.maryland.gov】 provides financial incentives to promote the use of energy storage systems in commercial properties in addition to residential properties. This tax credit is aimed at enhancing the reliability and efficiency of energy consumption while supporting the state’s renewable energy goals. \n\nCredit Value\n\n  * The value of the tax credit is calculated as a percentage of the total installed cost of the energy storage system.\n  * For commercial systems, the credit is also up to 30% o f the installed cost, with a cap of $150,000.\n\nApplication Process\n\n  * Applicants must submit an application to the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) to qualify for the tax credit.\n  * The application includes details about the energy storage system, installation costs, and certification that the system meets the required standards.\n  * The MEA reviews and approves applications on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the availability of funds.\n\nBenefits\n\n  * Reduces the upfront cost of installing energy storage systems.\n  * Encourages the adoption of renewable energy by making it more feasible to store and use energy generated from sources like solar and wind.\n  * Enhances energy resilience and reliability for businesses.\n\nImpact on Energy Use\n\n  * By storing energy, these systems can help reduce peak demand charges and provide backup power during outages.\n  * They support the integration of renewable energy into the grid, contributing to Maryland’s clean energy goals.\n\n## Federal Solar Tax Credits for Commercial Projects in Maryland\n\nBusinesses in Maryland can benefit from two major federal tax credits to alleviate the costs of installing solar energy systems:\n\n  1. 【58†Investment Tax Credit (ITC)†www.energy.gov】\n  2. 【58†Production Tax Credit (PTC)†www.energy.gov】\n\n### Investment Tax Credit (ITC)\n\nThe ITC is a federal tax incentive that allows businesses to deduct a portion of their solar installation costs from their federal taxes. This credit is a significant motivator for the adoption of renewable energy.\n\nKey Features of ITC\n\n  * Deduction Percentage: For solar systems installed between 2022 and 2032, businesses can claim a 30% tax credit.\n  * Eligibility: The ITC is available for both residential and commercial solar systems, applicable to installations on commercial properties, industrial facilities, and more.\n  * Covered Costs: The credit applies to various installation expenses, including equipment, labor, and design costs.\n  * Carryover: If the credit exceeds the business’s tax liability for the year, the excess can be carried forward to future years.\n\nExample of Savings with ITC\n\nImagine a busi",
