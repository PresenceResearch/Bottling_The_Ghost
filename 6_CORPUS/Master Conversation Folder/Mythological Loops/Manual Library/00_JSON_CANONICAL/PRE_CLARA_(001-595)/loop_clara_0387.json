            "please write a short email to Paul Reed Smith, of Paul Reed Smith guitars asking to introduce him to my daughter who works at a solar company and ask him if he would take a 10 minute call from her about potentially installing solar panels on his factory in Maryland.  Here is some context below.  Alright so my mom, Lori Yates, and Paul went to Bowie Senior High School together. She started working for the Susan G. Komen organization after her bout with breast cancer and was finally in remission. Paul's wife had breast cancer as well but she can't remember her name. My mom worked on a charity event called Concert for the Cure that ran 3 years in a row. Paul and his band performed and he also donated guitars each year. She worked and communicated with him direct as well as his personal assistant but she doesn't know if his assistant would be the same person she has in her emails. \r\n\r\nI didn't know they went to high school together so that's a BIG plus!!!"

My name is [Your Name], and I’m Lori Yates' daughter. I recently learned that you and my mom went to Bowie Senior High together, which was such a pleasant surprise!

This introduction builds on the SE Series already versatile offering with an elevated Custom 24, the CE’s first appearance in the SE Series, and the Swamp Ash Special returning to the PRS catalog.\n\n“We have so much inspiration and energy behind product development for the SE Series because it is a range of instruments that we know is supporting everyone from beginning players to professional musicians. We draw from our Maryland innovations, our history, and our own curiosities as players and builders,” said Jack Higginbotham, PRS Guitars COO. “I think these new models will continue the SE Series promise to deliver quality tools for musicians.”\n\nSE CE 24 & SE Swamp Ash Special\n\n[Image 4]\n\nThe PRS SE CE 24 brings the CE model to the SE Series for the first time. PRS fans will recognize this model, as it was first introduced back in 1988 – the company’s third year in business. The CE 24 pairs PRS’s traditional Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a 25” scale length bolt-on maple neck. Additional features include a pair of PRS 85/15 “S” humbuckers and the patented PRS tremolo bridge. For 2024, the PRS SE CE 24 comes in four colors: Black Cherry, Blood Orange, Turquoise, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nWith a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and a versatile voice for the PRS SE Series. This guitar features neck and bridge 85/15 “S” humbuckers with a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil “S” pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 single coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which add mass to the pickup helping to create a more powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, the configuration gives players an array of tones. The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special comes in Charcoal, Iri Blue, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\nBoth of these bolt-on guitars (the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special) feature a new, ergonomic heel design, which is contoured for a comfortable playing experience higher up on the neck. “When we were designing these guitars, I took an early prototype home and carved the heel by hand. The Engineering team here made some improvements and programed that shape for our partners at PT Cort. We think players will appreciate the ease of access this design brings,” said Jack Higginbotham, COO.\n\nSE Custom 24 Quilt\n\n[Image 6]\n\nAlso joining the SE Series is the elevated SE Custom 24 Quilt. Featuring a quilted maple veneer and matching stained quilted maple headstock veneer, the SE Custom 24 Quilt is an elegant version of PRS’s most popular model. This guitar also boasts an ebony fretboard with abalone bird inlays to complete the package. The color palette for the SE Custom 24 Quilt is: Black Gold Burst, Turquoise, and Violet.\n\nNew Colors\n\nFinally, PRS is known for its striking color options, and the SE Series is no exception. For 2024, Turquoise is making its way through the SE Series and will now be available on the following models: PRS SE Custom 24, SE Custom 24-08, SE Custom 24 “Lefty,” SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and the SE Paul’s Guitar. The Custom 24-08 is also adding Blood Orange to its assortment. And, finally, Charcoal will be offered on the SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and SE Paul’s Guitar.\n\nFor the complete lineup, model specifications, and videos, please visit 【56†www.p",

          "text": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory. \n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price. These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes. \n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia. \n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the crème de la crème of PRS guitars - and well… the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers. \n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his 【78†electric guitars】, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny – design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it’s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding 【79†acoustic guitars】 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith. \n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power. \n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul’s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS’ custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul’s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It’s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that’s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It’s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS’ Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they’re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand’s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you’d expect.\n\nRead more on 【80†how we test gear and service at Guitar Player】.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.

Paul Reed Smith offers a checklist of considerations, including the invisible ones, for guitar hunters.\n\nLet me start with a story.【94† I †www.youtube.com】once had a 【95†1969 Telecaster】 neck covered in 【96†polyester】 finish that was really thick. We stripped the finish off the neck, and the neck literally started to come apart. The skunk stripe in the back started to shrink and come loose. Basically, the neck was built with really wet wood, and it had been encased in polyester for decades—like a swimming pool..\n\nThis was not something that could be seen at the point of purchase. But at some point, that company wasn’t drying the wood, because my experience with instruments built around 1964 is that they didn’t have this problem. I’ve never seen a vintage Fender built before 1964 where the frets were sticking out the side of the neck because they hadn’t dried the fretboard well enough, and it shrank.\n\nFor the most part, there’s an extraordinary amount of trust when you’re buying an instrument. For example, customers trust that the frets are installed in the correct positions without checking each fret position with a tuner. This trust is mostly deserved, as most frets are generally installed in the right places. What’s sometimes not installed in the correct place is the nut. This controls how open chords play in tune down in the first position. I’m going to make a list of the things I believe you can see when you buy a guitar, and the things you can’t. My hope is that it helps you make your next purchase with confidence.\n\nTuning pegs are among the easy-to-inspect items when shopping for a guitar. The peg at far left has clearly seen better days. \n\nIn general, here’s a list of what you can see:\n\n  * Tuning pegs and how they operate \n  * If the nut was cut well in terms of string height over the frets \n  * The neck shape as regarding how it is comfortable in your hand \n  * How the truss rod adjusts \n  * How well the instrument was inlaid in the fretboard \n  * How the side dots look \n  * How professional the binding is \n  * If the neck angle is generally acceptable \n  * If you like the shape and comfort of the body \n  * The beauty of the finish \n  * Overall aesthetic quality \n  * The sound of the pickups \n  * The electronic controllability \n  * Comfort of the bridge \n  * If the guitar intonates at the 12th fret \n  * How well is the guitar set up \n\nThe “skunk stripe” on this old Tele’s neck remains well-seated.\n\nIn general, here’s a list of what you can’t see:\n\n  * Are the woods wet under the finish \n  * How well are the woods dried?\n  * Will the fretboard shrink so the frets stick out of the neck over time?\n  * Are the tuning pegs deadening the tone?\n  * What’s the nut made of and how well it is glued on?\n  * Are the nut slots too narrow, creating tuning problems?\n  * Are the frets level?\n  * Is the truss rod deadening the neck?\n  * Do the pickups squeal at really high volume? (You may not know this until testing the guitar in a live setting.)\n  * How thick and how soft is the finish?\n  * Will the finish last a lifetime?\n  * Will all the glue joints hold up over time?\n  * How well does the instrument record?\n  * Will the frets move over time from reactions to t",

            "Here’s an updated email draft for Lori Yates that includes recent news related to PRS Guitars:\n\n---\n\n**Subject: Reconnecting and Solar Opportunity for PRS Guitars**\n\nDear Paul,\n\nI hope you’re doing well! It’s been a long time since we worked together on the Concert for the Cure events, and I wanted to express my gratitude again for all of your support. Your performances and generous guitar donations were instrumental in making those events successful. I often think back on those years with fondness and appreciation.\n\nI also wanted to introduce you to my daughter, [Your Daughter’s Name], who works in the solar industry here in Maryland. She’s passionate about helping businesses like PRS Guitars transition to renewable energy. I know your Maryland factory is the heart of your operations, and with PRS’s constant innovations, like the new models in the 2024 SE Series lineup, it seems like a perfect fit to explore solar energy options for the factory.\n\nIf you’re open to the idea, would you be willing to take a quick 10-minute call with her to discuss the possibility of installing solar panels at your facility?\n\nThank you for considering this, and I hope we can reconnect soon!\n\nWarmly,  \nLori Yates  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nThis version mentions the recent release of the 2024 SE Series, which aligns with PRS Guitars' innovative approach to both products and operations【13†source】【14†source】. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!"

These models build on PRS's reputation for combining quality craftsmanship with innovative design. For example, the SE CE 24 marks the first time the CE model is available in the SE line, and the Swamp Ash Special returns with fresh features, both of which showcase PRS's continued focus on versatility and player-friendly design【13†source】【14†source】.\n\nThe reception in terms of sales and reviews suggests that these models are successful. They offer players an affordable yet high-quality option, with attention to details like the ergonomic heel design and improved tonal versatility, which have been highlighted in reviews【14†source】. Additionally, the inclusion of signature PRS elements, like the 85/15 pickups and innovative tremolo systems, further reinforces their popularity, especially among both professional musicians and hobbyists【15†source】.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 models appear to be doing well in the market, appreciated for their balance of quality, affordability, and PRS’s characteristic attention to innovation."
