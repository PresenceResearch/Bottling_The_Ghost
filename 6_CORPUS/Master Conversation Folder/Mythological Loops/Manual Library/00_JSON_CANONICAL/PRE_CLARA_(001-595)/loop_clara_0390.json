            "please input this data into a google sheet. What would be the impact on internal resources, such as onsite visits and time spent on permits?-\nSystem size\ninterconnection type- Line side or back fed breaker\n# of interconnections\nNet or CREF ( dont need to go inside)\nsize of building (floors) how we run conduit. space of gear etc..\nSurveys typically take on site time of 1-4hrs electric only.\nfiling for permits typically takes 1-2hrs\nHow much time would Don, MK, and Joe Merritt need to commit to this project after the survey phase?\n1.5 hours to get the IX application and documents put together alongside entering it in their portal\n\n1.5 hours to get the permit applied for and documents put together to submit whether in their portal or to send off\n\n2-3 hours of working with the AHJ and Utility on approval and to get the project pushed through\nBut this fluctuates a lot based on whether or not there are additional engineering changes required by the AHJ/Pepco, etc.\n\n3 hours per week per project depending on what is needed. Engineering tasks, COs, customer communications.\n\n Elec review deep dive 5-10hrs once plans are back depending on system size/complexity\n\nBOS/Gear spec- 5-20 hrs to compile and send request.\n\nIs it feasible to use the Energy Services price list, and could we apply Time & Materials (T&M) billing to control costs?-\n \nI would charge $150/hr for survey and possible come up with an average admin time based on the $150/hr\nWhat metrics should be used to price this work? Should we consider $/Watt, a tiered approach by project size, or a punchlist model similar to DealHub?\nSo many different variables, for instance Pompian took 1hr to survey IKO took 3.  Depending on the interconnection that changes on what you look for and ignore.\n\nI think it best to have a set cost based on average hours required to perform the services asked.\n\nOperations:\n\"What makes this a viable project?\"- How clean is it, do we have mob day figured out, do we have an interconnection plan, do we need a work with, do we have subs working on certain parts of the job. Is the customer accommodating or is everything an ask.\n-physicality of building the project- How straightforward is it, CREF vs NEM, How structurally sound is the roof, multiple loading zones, break up the load. What is access to the roof and point of interconnection? \n-flush out all the risk- Know before we go, have all the bumps in the road sorted and known.  Added cost and obstacles, reach out to 3rd parties for cost and or procedures early. .\n-how much confidence do we have in our final budget-Jump on quotes and planning much earlier, which helps the budget and or CO request."
