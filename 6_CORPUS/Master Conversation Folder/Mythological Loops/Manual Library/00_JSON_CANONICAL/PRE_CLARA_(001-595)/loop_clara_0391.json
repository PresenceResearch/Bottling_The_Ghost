            "Please make this document more concise and write this in the style of the attached decision memo https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tByhzug7U9yCOEGf-6eNaPGa9Vb7iGokfkSnkTYkj7Q/edit   DECISION/ACTION MEMORANDUM\n\nTO:\n \nFROM:\n \nPOSITION:\n \nDEPARTMENT:\n \nDECISION LEVEL:\n \nDATE:\n \nTOPIC:\n\n\n\n \nSummary\n\nThe commercial department is in need of a clear due diligence process and procedure for (i) cash deals and (ii) PPAs. Due to recent legislation, ccommercial projects have become lucrative for investors leading to a soaring demand. Lumina can capitalize on this demand through the implementation of due diligence processes and procedures which will shorten project lifecycles, improve customer experiences, decrease cost overruns and major changes to projects after a contract is signed, increase project profitability, and increase certainty of project scopes of work. We recommend that we (i) implement a due diligence process for cash deals that involves a deposit to complete the necessary due diligence work before providing the customer with a final price; and (ii) implement a due diligence process for projects financed using PPAs and loans through developers for which we have a pre-contract budget. Implementing a standardized approach to project predevelopment will elevate Lumina to the best-in-class level, comparable to larger, more established, and better-resourced developers. This initiative will ensure we adopt industry-leading processes and set a benchmark for excellence. \n\nBackground and Context\n\n\nThe Commercial division had been losing money consistently, requiring it to be “propped up” by residential and energy services divisions. Lumina currently \n\nThe process, ideally, should be applicable to all projects with minimal adjustments, which will promote clarity and uniformity. A lack of a formal internal due diligence process after the initial (discovery) sales call has contributed to (i) long timelines between the initial sales call and contract signing, (ii) oppressive customer contract requirements, (iii) lost opportunities, (iv) significant cost overruns that eat away at gross margin, (v) long project lifecycles caused by inefficiency and unnecessary delays in sales process; and (v) miscommunication between sales and operations teams. \n\nSales has streamlined the commercial sales process from lead acquisition to verbal commitments for projects. However, there are limited due diligence procedures or processes in place to accurately price and plan the project. The commercial teams do not have enough information to provide firm pricing and expectations for customers.\n\nHistorical Sales Process\n\nHistorically the sale process involved the initial discovery call, generating Dealhub pricing quote/requesting indicative pricing from developers, the solutions call, a submission of firm bid(PPA)/Pricing (cash deal), contract/PPA negotiations and execution, and then a handoff to operations.\n\nDiscovery Call\n\nDuring the discovery call, sales consultant’s obtain limited information regarding the location of the building, the roof layout, utility bills/usage, and the type of financing arrangement (whether cash, loan, or PPA) in which the customer may be interested..\n\nGenerate Indicative Pricing\n\nThe sales representative utilizes developer resources to obtain pricing for the system, including a proposed PPA rate (PPA) or a cash price (cash deals).\n\nSolutions Call\n\nSales representatives provide the customer with financing options and either an estimated PPA rate (PPA) or a price to build the project (cash deal).\n\nSubmission of Firm Bid (PPA)\n\nSales representatives submit a firm bid to the developer and obtain approval.\n\nContract/PPA Negotiations\n\nOnce the Sales representative receives a verbal commitment, a contract is submitted to the customer (cash) or a PPA and EPCA is negotiated with the developer and customer.\n\nHandoff to Operations\n\t\t\t\nOnce the contract is signed, the project is handed over to the operations team who reviews the project.\n\nRevised Process\n\nDue to challenges with cost creep and overruns, the process was recently revised to include a survey component and a final budget review. These have improved the process through increased visibility, but the process still falls short of improving the customer experience, facilitating a compression of the deal lifecycle, inaccurate scopes of work, and costs associated with \n\nCurrent Challenges and Impact\n\nThe lack of a defined due diligence process and procedure creates a number of challenges for the commercial sales and operations teams:\n\nCurrently, the sales team develops a lead, engages in initial conversations with the customer and then presents a contract containing pricing and a scope of work with imperfect information. \n\nContract has onerous, highly negotiated terms. These terms are necessary due to a lack of clarity of what the project actually entails and the costs. This can lead to hesitancy from customers to move forward with the proposed project and creates long contract review periods.\n\nThe lack of a clearly defined process results in an inefficient use of resources. When issues arise with a project that could have been discovered through a thorough due diligence process, it results in avoidable delays, demobilization and remobilization costs, cost associated with administrative time solving the issue and dealing with the customer. \n\nProjects languish in this stage. Without a clear process (direction), the project may sit for weeks or months. The longer a project sits the less “sticky” the project becomes.  Momentum is lost and interest wanes.  Keeping these projects top of mind can be difficult and going weeks without movement has often led to projects falling into “on hold” or not happening at all.\n\nBypassing any pre-term sheet/contract diligence commits Lumina to inaccurate pricing which is difficult to change with the customer or DSD. This causes friction with our developer partners and customers and undermines our reputation. \n\nMaterial project changes are discovered post-term sheet/contract. This requires a significant amount of re-negotiation with the parties involved.  \n\nProjects entering the first stages of development post-term sheet/contract are burdened by requirements set by incorrect data and/or assumptions.\n\nConstruction schedules are significantly altered as they were based upon incorrect assumptions. This causes friction between the parties and, in some cases, exposes Lumina to liquidated damages. Changes to the construction schedule also makes it difficult to effectively allocate resources and plan long-term project scheduling.\n\nCash flow is delayed as milestones are delayed by avoidable project changes and resubmission of permits and/or interconnections.  \n\nInevitable change orders slow project execution, erode customer confidence, and require more resources, including re-introduction of the sales team.\n\nGross margin is severely eroded, eliminated, or negative as unknown project costs are offset by profit dollars.\n\nBreakeven projects become wins. \nA lack of a clearly defined process means there is no clear direction for the sales team, which impacts morale and affects the sales team’s relationships with customers.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSuggested Action, Change, or Solution\n\nThe commercial division should implement a comprehensive due diligence process which begins with the initial sales call. Depending on the type of deal (e.g., cash, PPA, or loan) this may involve an initial investment by Lumina of cash and resources.\n\nThere is information that needs to be gathered and actions taken during due diligence to determine the feasibility of the project, the equipment required, the scope of work, the necessary labor, AHJ requirements, ________.  Specifically, the following assessments and work should be completed to have a clear understanding of the project:\n\nObtain detailed information regarding the Site and utility usage from Customer\nSite Survey\nElectrical\nPhotographs of the roof, utility room, etc.\nDetermination of method of connection\nEquipment mounting locations\nWhether conduit run needed\nDetermine equipment needed\nRoof Assessment\nStructural Analysis\nElectrical Survey\nAHJ Requirements Research\nConceptual Design\nInterconnection Submission (optional?)\n\nA due diligence process that includes the above assessments and work is critical to running a successful project.\n\nImpact \n\nThe implementation of a clear, comprehensive due diligence process will impact project profitability and lifecycle in addition to enhancing Lumina’s reputation as a leader in the industry. Specifically, the process will:\n\nEnsure more accurate pricing.\nIncrease close rate\nAllow Lumina to define more clearly the scope of work\nSupport more predictable construction schedules\nIncrease gross margin\nLimit renegotiation of contract terms and change orders.  \nIncrease morale - facilitate ownership of the project as a whole, not just separate teams\nIncrease customer confidence and improve reputation\n\nThe commercial department (and the organization as a whole) should start to feel the impact within 6 months, with the full impact being felt within 12-18 months.\n\nOptions\n\nCash Options\n\nStatus Quo - Please see Exhibit A\n\nUnpaid Due Diligence - Please see Exhibit A\n\nPaid Due Diligence - Please see Exhibit A\n\nPPA\n\nStatus Quo - Please See Exhibit B\n\nUnpaid Due Diligence - Please see Exhibit B\n\nLoan\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe commercial division should implement a “Paid Due Diligence” process for cash deals and an Unpaid Due Diligence for PPA and financed deals.\n\nPaid Due Diligence (Cash Deals)\n\nincrease customer engagement as the customer will have some “skin in the game.”\nLimit change orders\nReduce cost overruns/cost creep\nCreate more accurate budgets\nIncrease customer satisfaction/build strong reputation\nIncrease scalability of the commercial department - hire additional people to run the due diligence process once the pipeline is full (allows Eric to manage projects and get out of the minutiae of the day to day).\nEliminates out of pocket expenses to get project “contract ready”\nSimplify contract - soften terms to make them more mutual and customer-friendly because we have a clearer picture of the path the project will take\nReduce time to project ready\nImprove scheduling ability and accuracy\n\nUnpaid Due Diligence (PPA and Loans)\n\nImprove accuracy of pricing\nLimit change orders\nReduce cost overruns/cost creep\nBuild strong reputation with developers\nReduce time to determine if project viable\nReduce necessity for change orders\nImprove scheduling ability and accuracy\nNecessary given developers are require a firm price and viable project\n\nAction/Implementation\n\nOnce approved, sales, operations, and legal will develop an Initial Call Checklist, Survey Checklist, and a LNTP.\n\nBeta test date: Immediately upon approval\nTarget Launch date: October 1, 2024 (beginning of Q4), the respective processes will be implemented for the next available sale.\n\nThe commercial division will track the following metrics to measure success:\n\nCash\nTime from initial call to execution of LOE\nTime from initial call to LNTP completion\nLNTP duration\nTime from initial call to contract execution\nContract volume\nTurnaround time (contract negotiation)\nAcquisition cost\nNumber of change orders and type\nClose rate\nCustomer LNTP cost tolerance\nLNTP budget vs. final\nPPA/Loan\nDue diligence costs\nCost overruns, type\nTime from initial call to LOE\nTime from initial call to due diligence completion\nTime from initial call to contract execution\nDuration of due diligence\nClose rate\nChange orders and type\n\n\n\nAdditional Considerations, Assumptions, Comments, and Questions\n\nThe recommendations above assume that the developers will not contribute funds toward due diligence until a term sheet or contract is signed. This requirement defeats the purpose of performing the due diligence as Lumina is providing a firm price upon executing a term sheet or contract.\n\nWe have not obtained data to prove or support our hypotheses. We are requesting feedback prior to undertaking the time and effort to ensure our recommendations align with management."

This memorandum outlines three specific projects—Amidus, ICAST Hacienda, and 5040 New Hampster—detailing the issues identified at various stages and their impact on project timelines and costs. Implementing a comprehensive pre-contract due diligence process is critical to mitigating risks and ensuring smoother project execution.\n\n---\n\n### Background and Context\n\nAcross several projects, early identification of issues could have prevented significant project delays, cost overruns, and scope creep. These issues arise due to insufficient pre-contract planning and post-mobilization surprises, such as structural or utility complications. A structured due diligence process will resolve this by identifying key risks before contract signing, improving customer experience, and increasing project profitability.\n\n---\n\n### Current Challenges\n\n1. **Amidus:**\n   - **Pre-Contract Issues:** Minimal issues identified before contract execution.\n   - **Post-Contract Issues:** External conduit changes and PEPCO review redaction led to delays.\n   - **Result:** Project delays, scope creep, and increased costs.\n\n2. **ICAST Hacienda:**\n   - **Pre-Contract Issues:** Spacing/size changes and structural concerns.\n   - **Post-Contract Issues:** Structural issues placed the project on indefinite hold.\n   - **Result:** Significant delays and uncertainty regarding inventory.\n\n3. **5040 New Hampster:**\n   - **Pre-Contract Issues:** Sizing and obstacles identified early.\n   - **Post-Contract Issues:** General contractor incompetence affected execution.\n   - **Result:** Issues resolved prior to mobilization, avoiding delays.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Action\n\nImplement a structured due diligence process that includes:\n\n1. **Site Surveys and Utility Assessments:**\n   - Structural, mechanical, and electrical reviews.\n   - Detailed evaluation of roof, electrical panels, and connection methods.\n\n2. **Stakeholder Communication:**\n   - Clear, early communication with customers, contractors, and utilities to ensure alignment on project scopes and timelines.\n\n3. **Pre-Contract Budget Review:**\n   - Develop a detailed pre-contract budget to avoid post-contract changes that lead to delays and cost overruns.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\nBy instituting a comprehensive due diligence process, the commercial division can expect:\n- **Reduced Delays:** Identifying risks early will lead to more predictable project timelines.\n- **Improved Cost Control:** Avoiding scope creep and change orders will protect gross margins.\n- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Fewer surprises will improve customer confidence and satisfaction.\n- **Stronger Reputation:** Efficient, well-planned projects will build trust with both customers and developers.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nThe commercial division should adopt a \"Paid Due Diligence\" process for cash deals and an \"Unpaid Due Diligence\" process for PPAs and loans. This will ensure that all potential issues are identified and addressed early in the project lifecycle, reducing risk and improving project outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Action/Implementation\n\nOnce approved:\n- Develop and implement a Site Survey Checklist, Electrical Review Protocol, and a Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) process.\n- Target launch: October 1, 2024, for the next available sale.\n\nTracking Metrics:\n- Time to contract execution\n- Number of change orders\n- Project gross margin\n- Close rate\n\nThis strategy will reduce cost overruns, improve project timelines, and increase customer satisfaction, positioning Lumina Solar as a best-in-class solar provider."

            "### DECISION/ACTION MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** [Recipient Name]\n\n**FROM:** [Your Name]\n\n**POSITION:** [Your Position]\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** [Your Department]\n\n**DECISION LEVEL:** [Level of Decision]\n\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n\n**TOPIC:** Addressing Pre-Contract and Post-Contract Issues in Solar Projects\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe commercial solar division is currently facing significant project delays, cost overruns, and scope creep primarily due to inadequate pre-contract due diligence and lack of detailed project planning. These issues are evident across multiple projects, such as Amidus, ICAST Hacienda, and 5040 New Hampster, where risks and challenges surfaced only after contracts were signed, leading to increased project timelines, strained client relationships, and potential legal disputes. A comprehensive due diligence process, implemented prior to contract execution, would mitigate these risks by ensuring that project details are thoroughly examined, client expectations are managed effectively, and operational teams are prepared to execute projects with minimal disruption.\n\nThe recommendation is to introduce a robust due diligence process involving thorough pre-contract evaluation of project requirements (site surveys, utility connections, structural assessments), clear communication between sales, operations, and clients, and implementation of a Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) model to prevent misaligned expectations and post-contract surprises. The proposed changes aim to improve project execution, reduce costs, and protect margins, positioning Lumina Solar as a leader in project efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n---\n\n### Background and Context\n\nHistorically, the commercial division has experienced challenges stemming from an incomplete understanding of project requirements at the point of contract signing. The lack of detailed pre-contract assessments has contributed to:\n- **Project Delays**: Incomplete or inaccurate information leads to rework and extended timelines.\n- **Cost Overruns**: Miscommunication between teams and unforeseen project scope changes create unanticipated costs.\n- **Scope Creep**: Projects grow in complexity after mobilization due to previously unidentified issues.\n- **Client Frustration**: Poor communication and mismanaged expectations have negatively affected customer experience and satisfaction.\n\nThree projects—Amidus, ICAST Hacienda, and 5040 New Hampster—highlight these issues. Despite varying project scopes, a common theme is the failure to accurately identify risks and requirements before contract execution. This has resulted in costly change orders, strained relationships with customers and contractors, and, in some cases, indefinite project delays.\n\n#### **Project Overview:**\n- **Amidus**: Post-contract delays caused by unforeseen utility challenges (PEPCO approval retraction) and poor coordination regarding external conduit installation.\n- **ICAST Hacienda**: Significant structural issues identified only after contract execution led to the project being put on indefinite hold.\n- **5040 New Hampster**: General contractor incompetence and early project misalignment caused issues, although the LNTP model helped mitigate major risks before mobilization.\n\nEach of these projects underscores the need for a standardized pre-contract due diligence process to improve project feasibility assessment, manage client expectations, and ensure project timelines and budgets are met.\n\n---\n\n### Current Challenges and Impact\n\nThe current process for commercial solar projects lacks the rigorous pre-contract due diligence necessary to avoid the issues described above. This has led to:\n\n1. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Sales teams are committing to projects based on incomplete data, forcing operations to address unforeseen issues later in the process.\n   \n2. **Contract Complexity**: Contracts are often highly negotiated and include onerous terms to protect Lumina Solar from the uncertainty of project details. However, this leads to longer contract review periods, client hesitancy, and, in some cases, lost opportunities.\n   \n3. **Missed Project Opportunities**: Lengthy project timelines and poor pre-contract preparation result in projects stalling or being put on indefinite hold. This lack of momentum has led to some projects failing altogether.\n   \n4. **Cost Overruns**: Misalignment between pre-contract assumptions and post-mobilization realities results in unplanned expenses, which erode project profitability. Projects that should have been profitable have instead seen gross margins significantly reduced or eliminated.\n   \n5. **Customer Confidence**: Unforeseen project changes and delays erode customer trust, making it difficult to maintain strong client relationships and leading to reputational damage.\n\n#### **Project Examples:**\n- **Amidus**: PEPCO redacted its “unconditional” approval due to unanticipated inverter changes, leading to significant delays, finger-pointing, and potential litigation.\n- **ICAST Hacienda**: Structural and mechanical issues were not identified during the initial site assessment, leading to an indefinite project hold.\n- **5040 New Hampster**: General contractor issues were noted before mobilization, but proactive LNTP measures helped mitigate larger risks. However, early communication failures delayed project completion.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Process\n\nTo resolve these issues, a more thorough pre-contract due diligence process is required. The proposed process will include:\n\n1. **Pre-Contract Due Diligence:**\n   - **Site Survey and Utility Assessment**: A comprehensive on-site evaluation will be conducted to assess key project components such as roof structure, utility usage, and electrical system suitability. This will help identify potential risks related to structural soundness, connection methods, and necessary utility approvals before contracts are signed.\n   \n   - **Customer and Stakeholder Communication**: Clear and transparent communication with clients, contractors, and utility providers will be prioritized to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on project expectations, requirements, and timelines.\n   \n   - **Budget and Scope Review**: A detailed budget review will be conducted before signing to prevent scope creep and manage customer expectations.\n\n2. **Post-Contract Implementation:**\n   - **LNTP Model**: A Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) process will be implemented, allowing for detailed project planning and budget validation before full mobilization. This will prevent costly changes after project mobilization and ensure that contracts are based on accurate information.\n   \n   - **Milestone Tracking and Accountability**: Project milestones will be established early, with clear roles and responsibilities assigned to each team member to ensure accountability and prevent delays.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Action\n\nTo prevent further delays, cost overruns, and scope creep, the commercial division must implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Develop and Implement a Standardized Pre-Contract Due Diligence Process**: This process should be applicable to all commercial projects and will include:\n   - **Detailed Site Survey**: Including roof structure assessment, electrical evaluation, and equipment mounting location analysis.\n   - **Utility Assessment**: Understanding the project’s connection to existing utilities, any required permits, and potential utility challenges.\n   - **Comprehensive Budget Review**: Ensuring the final contract price accurately reflects project costs.\n   \n2. **Adopt the LNTP Model**: This will allow Lumina Solar to mitigate risks before full project mobilization, enabling teams to address any issues early without committing the company to full construction and implementation.\n\n3. **Improve Customer and Internal Communication**: By ensuring transparent communication channels between sales, operations, clients, and external partners, the division can reduce miscommunication and improve project outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\nThe introduction of a robust due diligence process is expected to result in:\n\n- **Improved Accuracy in Pricing**: Projects will be based on accurate pre-contract assessments, ensuring that the pricing is reflective of the true scope of work.\n- **Reduced Project Timelines**: By addressing potential issues before contract execution, project timelines will become more predictable, leading to quicker project completion.\n- **Fewer Change Orders**: A clearer understanding of the project scope early on will limit the need for costly change orders, protecting project margins.\n- **Increased Customer Satisfaction**: Clear communication and a better understanding of project risks will improve customer confidence, leading to stronger client relationships.\n- **Enhanced Reputation**: The commercial division will be viewed as a more reliable and efficient partner, improving Lumina Solar’s reputation with both clients and developers.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nThe commercial division should move forward with the implementation of the following:\n\n1. **Paid Due Diligence Process for Cash Deals**:\n   - Require an upfront investment from the customer to complete a comprehensive pre-contract due diligence process. This will ensure customer commitment and reduce the likelihood of scope changes after the contract is signed.\n\n2. **Unpaid Due Diligence for PPA and Loan-Financed Projects**:\n   - For projects financed through PPAs and loans, the due diligence process will still be performed, but without requiring upfront payment. This ensures that developers and customers can move forward with confidence that the project is feasible and accurately priced.\n\n---\n\n### Action/Implementation\n\nOnce approved, the sales, operations, and legal teams will collaborate to develop an Initial Site Survey Checklist, Electrical Review Protocol, and a standardized LNTP model.\n\n- **Target Beta Test Launch**: Immediate implementation upon approval.\n- **Full Implementation Date**: October 1, 2024 (beginning of Q4).\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- Time from initial call to contract execution.\n- Number of change orders issued post-contract.\n- Close rate of commercial projects.\n- Gross margins on completed projects.\n- Customer satisfaction ratings.\n\nBy establishing this process, Lumina Solar can significantly reduce delays and cost overruns, streamline project execution, and solidify its reputation as an industry leader in commercial solar development."
