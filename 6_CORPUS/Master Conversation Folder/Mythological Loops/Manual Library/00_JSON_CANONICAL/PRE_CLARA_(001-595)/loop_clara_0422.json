The 【38†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program】 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District’s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n【77†Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report】\n\n【78†Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports】 \n\n  * 【79†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 1, 2023】\n  * 【80†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 2, 2022】\n  * 【81†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 3, 2021】\n  * 【82†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020†edocket.dcpsc.org】\n  * 【83†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019】\n  * 【84†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018】\n  * 【85†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017】\n  * 【86†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017】\n  * 【87†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016】\n  * 【88†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015】\n  * 【89†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015",

          "text": "on January 28, 2022, on a new distribution \r\nsystem upgrade cost-sharing approach for \r\nnon-CREF projects with an overall cap of $1 \r\nmillion. Subject to availability of funds, indi\u0002vidual projects are capped at $5,000, or 50% \r\nof the upgrade costs. The Commission will re\u0002view compliance reporting enhancements re\u0002lated to the monitoring of distribution system \r\nupgrade costs during this NOPR review pro\u0002cess. \r\n• At year-end 2021, the total amount of DER in \r\nthe District stood at an estimated 353 MW, \r\nequating to more than 17% of peak load, in\u0002cluding about 155 MW of solar certified RPS \r\nfacilities located in the District. \r\nFollowing an earlier rulemaking proposal in 2021, the \r\nCommission recently finalized new rules to foster in\u0002creased accountability and accuracy, and to mitigate \r\nthe risk of fraud and negligence in the reporting of ac\u0002tual solar facility production. Effective April 1, 2022, \r\nnew solar facilities, regardless of system capacity, will \r\nrequire a revenue grade generation meter or in\u0002verter-based generation measurement equipment, \r\nas well as the submittal of construction drawings that \r\nindicate the orientation of the solar panels. \r\nTo help the District meet its climate change commit\u0002ments and renewable energy goals, the Commission \r\napproved Order No. 19897 (released April 12, 2019), \r\nthat established a pilot program to procure renewa\u0002ble energy supply through long-term power purchase \r\nagreements (“PPA”) for electricity generated by solar \r\nor wind power facilities located within the PJM Inter\u0002connection region with a target quantity of 5% of the \r\nannual default electricity supply service Standard Of\u0002fer Service (“SOS”) load: \r\n• Pepco, as the SOS Administrator, will procure \r\nthe remaining components for that 5% — in\u0002cluding, among other items, capacity. \r\n• Provisions will have to be made to accommo\u0002date the intermittent nature of the renewable\r\nenergy provided by the PPA since the energy \r\nfrom the PPA will not strictly follow load de\u0002mand. \r\n• The Commission anticipates that renewable \r\nenergy supply from the PPA will begin to \r\nserve the target quantity of 5% of SOS load by \r\nthe end of 2024.\r\n• The Commission will consider opportunities \r\nfor further expansion of this program.Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia 1 \r\nI — INTRODUCTION AND \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThe D.C. Council enacted the REPS Act on January \r\n19, 2005, and established annual RPS, that required a \r\nminimum percentage of the District’s electricity sup\u0002pliers’ retail sales must be derived from renewable \r\nenergy resources beginning January 1, 2007. The RPS \r\nminimum requirements, among other things, were \r\namended by the Clean and Affordable Energy Act of \r\n2008 (“CAEA”).\r\nii Further changes to the RPS program \r\noccurred on August 1, 2011, when the Distributed \r\nGeneration Amendment Act of 2011 (“DGAA”) be\u0002came law.iii Additional amendments to the RPS pro\u0002gram became effective on April 30, 2015, as a result \r\nof the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Amendment \r\nAct of 2014 (“RPS Amendment Act”); and October 8, \r\n2016, as a result of the Renewable Portfolio Standard \r\nExpansion Amendment Act of 2016 (“RPS Expansion \r\nAct”). The most recent changes became effective on \r\nMarch 22, 2019, as a result of the CleanEnergy Act.\r\nRenewable energy resources were divided into two \r\ncategories, Tier I and Tier II, with Tier I resources in\u0002cluding solar energy, wind, biomass, methane, geo\u0002thermal, ocean, fuel cells, and wastewater used as a \r\nheat source or sink and Tier II resources including bi\u0002omass, hydroelectric power other than pumped stor\u0002age generation and waste-to-energy.iv Although min\u0002imum percentage requirements were specified for \r\nTier I and Tier II resources, Tier I resources could be \r\nused to comply with the Tier II standard. In addition, \r\na minimum requirement is carved out specifically for \r\nsolar energy. The REPS Act allowedan electricity sup\u0002plier to begin receiving and accumulating renewable \r\nenergy credits as of January 1, 2006.\r\nThe REPS Act required that the Commission adopt \r\nregulations, or orders, governing the application and \r\ntransfer of RECs and implementation of the REPS \r\nAct. The RPS rules became effective upon the publi\u0002cation of the Notice of Final Rulemaking in the D.C. \r\nRegister on January 18, 2008. The Commission’s \r\nRules can be found in Chapter 29 of 15 DCMR. As \r\npart of its RPS rules, the Commission established a \r\nprocess for certifying eligible renewable energy gen\u0002erators.\r\nOn October 22, 2008, the CAEA became law. The law, \r\namong other things, amended the REPS Act and \r\nchanged the definition of solar energy to provide eli\u0002gibility for solar thermal applications that do not gen\u0002erate electricity, raised the RPS requirements to 20% \r\nby 2020, and increased certain alternative compli\u0002ance fees.\r\nThe DGAA disallowed most new solar energy sys\u0002tems located outside of the District from being certi\u0002fied by the Commission for the RPS program, after \r\nJanuary 31, 2011 — although solar energy systems lo\u0002cated outside of the District that were certified prior \r\nto February 1, 2011, were “grandfathered” and re\u0002main eligible under the RPS program for the solar \r\ncarve-out requirement. In addition, among other \r\nthings, the legislation increased the solar RPS re\u0002quirement from 2011 through 2023 (up to ",

            "The Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) in Washington, D.C. has undergone several key amendments since its inception, significantly affecting the solar market. Here's a summary of important amendments and their impacts:\n\n1. **Initial Establishment (2005)**: The RPS was first established in 2005 under the *Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act of 2004*. It created a framework requiring electricity suppliers to derive a growing percentage of electricity from renewable sources, including solar energy【6†source】.\n\n2. **Clean and Affordable Energy Act (2008)**: This amendment raised the renewable energy requirements to 20% by 2020 and increased penalties for non-compliance. It also defined solar energy as a key contributor to the RPS, further encouraging solar development【6†source】.\n\n3. **Distributed Generation Amendment (2011)**: This amendment emphasized the importance of solar systems within the District itself, limiting the eligibility of solar systems located outside of D.C. for receiving renewable energy credits【7†source】. This boosted local solar installations as projects outside the District no longer qualified.\n\n4. **Expansion Amendment Act (2016)**: The RPS Expansion Amendment required 50% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2032, including a solar carve-out of 5%【9†source】. This amendment was critical in scaling up solar energy's role in D.C.'s energy landscape.\n\n5. **Local Solar Expansion Amendment (2022)**: This legislation increased the solar energy requirements further, requiring 15% of the District's electricity to come from solar by 2041. It also introduced mechanisms to support low-income households through the *Solar for All* program【9†source】【10†source】.\n\n6. **Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Amendment (2024)**: This amendment, included in the *Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Support Act*, introduced exemptions for electricity sold to the D.C. government from the RPS requirements until 2028. It also prohibited the government from purchasing renewable energy credits that don’t meet the RPS requirements【8†source】【6†source】. This move could potentially slow the immediate demand for renewable credits from government-related energy consumption but maintains a longer-term commitment to renewable energy growth.\n\n### Impact on the Solar Market:\nThese amendments collectively created a robust incentive structure for the installation of solar systems within D.C. The continual increase in the solar carve-out percentage, along with financial penalties for non-compliance, drives both residential and commercial solar installations. Additionally, programs like *Solar for All* aim to make solar energy accessible to low-income households, creating an inclusive market for clean energy【7†source】【9†source】.\n\nD.C.’s RPS policies have positioned the District as a leader in urban solar energy adoption, stimulating demand for both small-scale rooftop systems and larger solar farms within the PJM Interconnection region【9†source】【10†source】."

            "The *Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Amendment Act of 2024* introduced changes to the existing renewable energy policy in Washington, D.C., with key impacts on the government’s approach to renewable energy purchases and the broader goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This amendment is part of the *Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Support Act* and includes several notable provisions. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n\n### Key Provisions of the Amendment:\n\n1. **Exemption of Government Electricity Sales**:\n   One of the main changes introduced by this amendment is the exemption of certain electricity sales to the District of Columbia government from the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. Specifically, the electricity sold to the D.C. government, excluding independent agencies and authorities, will not need to comply with the RPS from **January 1, 2024**, to **September 30, 2028**【8†source】【9†source】. This means that during this period, electricity used by the government does not need to be sourced from renewable energy, which temporarily reduces the government's direct renewable energy obligation.\n\n2. **Restriction on Purchasing Non-Compliant Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)**:\n   The amendment also prevents the District government from purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs) that do not meet the RPS requirements unless the electricity it purchases complies with the RPS【8†source】. Essentially, the government cannot use RECs as a way to bypass the renewable energy standard during the exemption period, ensuring that any credits they purchase are tied to actual compliance with renewable energy generation requirements.\n\n3. **Timeline and Scope**:\n   The temporary exemption and the restriction on non-compliant REC purchases apply for nearly five years (from January 2024 to September 2028). This temporary relaxation affects only the government’s electricity consumption, meaning the rest of the electricity market, including private and commercial sectors, must continue to comply with RPS standards【8†source】.\n\n4. **Long-Term Commitment to Renewable Energy**:\n   Despite the short-term exemption, the District’s long-term goals for renewable energy, especially solar, remain ambitious. By 2041, the District is required to achieve **100% renewable energy sourcing**, with specific solar carve-outs increasing incrementally through the years. These longer-term goals ensure that the city stays on track toward its renewable energy objectives, even though the temporary exemption is designed to give the government flexibility【9†source】【10†source】.\n\n### Rationale and Potential Impacts:\n\n- **Flexibility for Government Energy Procurement**:\n   The exemption offers the District government more flexibility in procuring electricity during this period without needing to meet stringent RPS requirements. This might be to reduce costs or manage operational constraints while balancing the ongoing efforts to transition the District’s energy mix to more renewable sources【6†source】.\n\n- **Potential Delay in Renewable Energy Adoption**:\n   While the amendment only applies to the government, it could slow down the pace at which the government adopts renewable energy for its own operations. The temporary exemption may reduce immediate demand for solar and other renewable sources from government entities, although private and commercial sectors will continue to push forward under the RPS mandates【8†source】【9†source】.\n\n- **Maintained Focus on Long-Term Solar Goals**:\n   The solar carve-out requirements, which continue to increase annually, ensure that D.C. remains committed to fostering solar energy. By 2041, 15% of the District’s energy must come from solar sources【9†source】. This provides a counterbalance to the temporary exemption for the government, as the broader market must still push toward aggressive renewable adoption.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe *Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Amendment Act of 2024* provides temporary relief for the D.C. government’s electricity procurement, allowing them to step back from immediate renewable energy compliance until 2028. However, the broader RPS targets remain intact, ensuring long-term growth in renewable energy, particularly solar, across the District. The amendment reflects a balance between short-term flexibility and long-term commitments to environmental sustainability【6†source】【8†source】【9†source】."

Normally, ACPs are paid by electricity suppliers who fail to meet the RPS requirements, as a way to encourage compliance. However, since the D.C. government is exempt during this time, there will be no obligation to pay these compliance fees for government electricity purchases【8†source】【9†source】.\n\nThe exemption applies solely to government purchases and does not affect private or commercial electricity customers, who must continue to comply with the RPS and potentially pay ACPs if they fail to meet the standard.

            "No, the utility supplying electricity to the D.C. government will **not** be required to pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) during the exemption period. Here's why:\n\nUnder the *Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Amendment Act of 2024*, electricity sold to the D.C. government between January 1, 2024, and September 30, 2028, is **exempt** from the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. This exemption relieves both the government and the electricity supplier from the obligation to meet the renewable energy standards for that specific portion of electricity【8†source】.\n\nSince the RPS doesn't apply during this period, the utility supplying electricity to the D.C. government is also exempt from paying the ACP for any shortfall in meeting the renewable energy requirements. ACPs are penalties imposed on suppliers who fail to meet the RPS standards by sourcing the required percentage of renewable energy or acquiring Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). However, because the exemption explicitly removes the RPS requirement for electricity sold to the government, no ACP is triggered for non-compliance【9†source】.\n\nIn summary, neither the D.C. government nor the utility will have to pay ACPs for electricity sold to the government during the specified exemption period. The rest of the market, however, still needs to comply with the RPS or pay ACPs for any shortfall."

            "Yes, utilities in Washington, D.C. are allowed to pass along the costs associated with compliance under the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS), including the **Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP)**, to their customers. If the utility finds that paying the ACP is a more cost-effective way to meet the RPS than purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), they can recover those ACP costs through a **non-bypassable surcharge** on the bills of their customers.\n\nHere are key points regarding this:\n\n1. **Cost Recovery**: Under the RPS regulations, electricity suppliers can recover costs for compliance, including the ACP, if it is the least-cost option compared to purchasing RECs or renewable energy. This is done through a surcharge added to the utility bills of customers【7†source】【9†source】.\n\n2. **Disclosure Requirement**: The surcharge for ACP or other compliance costs must be clearly disclosed on customer bills. This ensures transparency regarding why additional costs are being passed along【9†source】.\n\n3. **Least-Cost Compliance**: The utility is permitted to pay the ACP only if it is more cost-effective than purchasing renewable energy or RECs, but either way, the cost is typically passed on to the customer.\n\nThus, if a customer’s electricity consumption leads the utility to pay the ACP instead of purchasing RECs, the utility can charge that customer more, as long as the process follows the rules outlined by the Public Service Commission and is disclosed appropriately."

Government (2024–2028)**:\n   The provision that \"the standard shall not apply to electricity sold to the District of Columbia government\" between January 1, 2024, and September 30, 2028, means that **electricity sold to the D.C. government is exempt from meeting the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS)** during this period. This means that the electricity supplied to the D.C. government does not need to come from renewable sources or meet the specific renewable energy percentages required under the RPS. Therefore, the utility is not obligated to meet those renewable energy targets or purchase Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) for the government’s electricity consumption during this time【8†source】【9†source】.\n\n2. **Restriction on REC Purchases by the D.C. Government**:\n   The second part states that \"the District of Columbia government shall not purchase renewable energy credits that do not meet the requirements of the standard until the electricity sold to the District of Columbia government is in compliance with the standard.\" This means that during the exemption period, the D.C. government cannot buy \"non-compliant\" RECs (i.e., credits that don't meet the RPS) until the electricity they purchase meets the RPS standards again (after the exemption ends in 2028). In essence, this prevents the government from using RECs as a workaround to artificially meet renewable energy targets when the underlying electricity purchased is not compliant with RPS requirements【8†source】【9†source】.\n\n### Key Implications:\n- During the exemption period, the D.C. government is not required to comply with RPS standards, meaning they do not need to use renewable energy or purchase RECs.\n- The government cannot purchase RECs that don't meet the RPS standards during this time, effectively ensuring that any credits used in the future must correspond to actual compliance once the exemption period ends.\n\nThis structure is designed to temporarily reduce the financial and operational burden on the D.C. government while ensuring that long-term commitments to renewable energy are not bypassed by purchasing credits that don't reflect real renewable energy use."

            "No, the utility will **not** be required to pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) for electricity sold to the District of Columbia government during the exemption period (January 1, 2024 – September 30, 2028). Here's why:\n\nThe *Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) Amendment Act of 2024* explicitly **exempts** electricity sold to the D.C. government from the RPS requirements during this time frame【9†source】. Since the RPS requirements do not apply to the electricity sold to the government, the utility does not need to purchase Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) or meet the renewable energy percentage targets for this portion of its sales.\n\nNormally, if a utility fails to meet the RPS by not sourcing the required percentage of renewable energy or by not purchasing RECs, it would have to pay the ACP. However, because the D.C. government is **exempt** from the RPS during this period, the utility does not face this obligation for the energy sold to the government. This exemption effectively removes both the requirement to meet renewable energy targets and the ACP penalties for non-compliance for the government's electricity consumption.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The utility does not have to buy RECs or meet the RPS for electricity sold to the D.C. government from 2024 to 2028.\n- Therefore, it is not required to pay the ACP for non-compliance during this exemption period【8†source】【9†source】."

            "so then I don't understand this \"Bowser’s new budget would get DGS out of the renewable credit market altogether. Instead, the agency would tell its electric providers to pay the compliance fees, costing the city roughly $4 million more each year after the costs are passed along to the government. The mayor’s team needs the SETF money to help cover those extra costs, but it gets to count the roughly $86 million in fees as revenue over the next four years, patching some holes in the budget. This might all seem like a silly bit of accounting, but the CFO will only certify the budget if it’s “balanced.”\""

            "The statement you’re referring to highlights a situation where the District of Columbia's **Department of General Services (DGS)** will shift its strategy regarding the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS). Instead of purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to comply with the RPS, DGS will instruct its electricity providers to simply **pay the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP)**. This will result in increased costs that are ultimately passed on to the city, **roughly $4 million more each year**. \n\nHere’s a breakdown of what this means:\n\n1. **No More REC Purchases**: Instead of participating in the renewable energy credit market by purchasing RECs, DGS will allow its electricity providers to pay the ACP, which is the penalty for not complying with the RPS. This is a strategic decision to avoid the complexity of purchasing RECs, which may be costly or scarce.\n\n2. **Increased Costs**: The ACP costs will be passed on to the city, adding about **$4 million per year** in extra expenses. The utility providers will likely pass the cost of these compliance fees onto the city in the form of higher electricity rates, which is why the city will bear these additional costs.\n\n3. **Budget Maneuvering**: The city plans to use funds from the **Sustainable Energy Trust Fund (SETF)** to cover the increased costs from paying the ACP instead of purchasing RECs. At the same time, the city can account for the ACP payments as **revenue** in its budget calculations, helping to balance the budget. By counting these ACP fees as revenue (about **$86 million over four years**), the city can patch some holes in its budget, which is necessary for the budget to be certified as balanced by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)【8†source】【6†source】.\n\n### The Accounting Logic:\nThis approach might seem like a \"silly bit of accounting\" because on the surface, the city is shifting from one type of expenditure (buying RECs) to another (paying the ACP), but it allows the city to count ACP payments as revenue. This strategy helps the city balance its budget on paper, even though it results in higher energy costs for the government in the short term. \n\nIn summary, DGS is opting to pay the ACP, leading to higher direct costs for the city but enabling the city to use a budgetary maneuver to meet the CFO's requirement for a balanced budget by leveraging these payments as revenue sources."
