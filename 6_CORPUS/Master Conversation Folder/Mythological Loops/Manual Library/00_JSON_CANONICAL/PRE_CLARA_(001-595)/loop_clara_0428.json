            "The IRS provides guidance regarding the Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under **IRS Notice 2013-70**, which clarifies how certain costs associated with solar installations may be included in the calculation of the credit. Specifically, the guidance allows the inclusion of certain roofing costs, but only if the work is \"integral to\" the installation of solar panels. For instance, if a new roof or specific structural improvements are necessary to support the solar installation, those costs may be eligible.\n\nHowever, general roof replacements or repairs that are not required for the solar installation, or are simply incidental, do not qualify for the ITC. The IRS distinguishes between costs that are integral to the solar energy system and those that are merely routine improvements or repairs.\n\nHere's how the costs may be treated:\n1. **Eligible Costs**: If the roofing work is necessary to install the solar system (such as structural support or specific modifications required for panel installation), it could be partially included in the ITC.\n2. **Non-Eligible Costs**: General roof replacement or unrelated repairs are not eligible for the tax credit.\n\nThe tax credit can generally only apply to the portion of roofing costs that directly relate to the solar installation.\n\nFor specific cases, it's recommended to consult a tax professional or reference IRS Notice 2013-70 to determine how much of the roofing cost can qualify for the tax credit based on the nature of the solar installation.\n\nWould you like me to link any additional IRS materials or summarize specific parts of the notice?"

          "text": "costs, the sales tax is similarly ineligible for the credit. \r\nQ-10: Are tenant-stockholders in a cooperative housing corporation and condominium \r\nowners eligible to claim the credits? - 5 -\r\nA-10: Yes. Sections 25C(e)(1) and 25D(e)(5) treat a tenant-stockholder (as defined in \r\n§ 216) in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in § 216) as making his or her \r\nproportionate share (as defined in § 216(b)(3)) of any expenditures of such corporation. \r\nSimilarly, §§ 25C(e)(1) and 25D(e)(6) treat a member of a condominium management \r\nassociation as having made the individual’s proportionate share of any expenditures of \r\nsuch association. \r\nQ-11: If a government or a public utility provides a subsidy (for example, an incentive, \r\ngrant, or rebate) to a taxpayer to purchase or install a qualifying property under § 25C or \r\n§ 25D, is the taxpayer required to reduce the cost basis of the property by the amount of \r\nthe subsidy received, thereby reducing the amount of the qualified expenditure for which \r\na credit may be claimed? \r\nA-11: The answer depends on the facts that apply to each taxpayer. \r\n.01 Public Utility. Under § 136, if a public utility provides (directly or indirectly) a \r\nsubsidy to a customer for the purchase or installation of any energy conservation \r\nmeasure, the customer does not include in his or her gross income the value of the \r\nsubsidy. As a result, the taxpayer may not claim a credit for the amount of the subsidy \r\nthat is excluded from the taxpayer’s gross income. This rule applies whether a third\u0002party contractor receives a subsidy on behalf of the taxpayer or the taxpayer receives \r\nthe subsidy directly. Not all payments from a public utility fall within the provisions of \r\n§ 136. \r\n.02 Rebates. Rebates generally represent a reduction in the purchase price or \r\ncost of property, and the taxpayer must exclude the amount of the rebate from the \r\namount of the qualified expenditure on which the taxpayer calculates the tax credit. In \r\ngeneral, in order for a receipt of funds to be considered a nontaxable rebate, the rebate \r\nmust be based on or related to the cost of the property; the rebate must be received \r\nfrom someone having a reasonable nexus to the sale of the property, for example, the \r\nmanufacturer, distributor, or seller/installer; and the rebate must not represent payment \r\nor compensation for services. \r\n.03 State Energy-Efficiency Incentives. A state may provide energy-efficiency \r\nincentives to encourage taxpayers to purchase qualifying property under § 25C or \r\n§ 25D. Section 136 does not address these incentives. \r\nGenerally, a taxpayer is not required to reduce the purchase price or cost of property \r\nacquired with a governmental energy-efficiency incentive that is not a rebate. Many \r\nstates label their energy-efficiency incentives as rebates, but these incentives may not \r\nin fact constitute rebates or purchase-price adjustments for federal income tax \r\npurposes. - 6 -\r\nHowever, for qualifying property under § 25C placed in service after 2010 that is \r\nfinanced in whole or in part by subsidized energy financing, the amount of expenditures \r\neligible for the § 25C credit does not include any expenditures that are made from \r\nsubsidized energy financing. Subsidized energy financing means financing provided \r\nunder a federal, state, or local program a principal purpose of which is to provide \r\nsubsidized financing for projects designed to conserve or produce energy. \r\nQ-12: If a taxpayer is eligible to claim a state tax credit related to the purchase of \r\nqualifying property under § 25C or § 25D, is the taxpayer required to reduce the cost \r\nbasis of the property by the amount of the state tax credit claimed, thereby reducing the \r\namount of the qualified expenditure for which the § 25C or § 25D credit may be \r\nclaimed? \r\n \r\nA-12: No. The taxpayer does not reduce the amount of the qualified expenditure by the \r\namount of the state tax credit claimed in calculating the credits. \r\nQ-13: If a taxpayer finances the purchase of a qualifying property under § 25C or § 25D \r\nthrough the seller of the property, may the taxpayer calculate the amount of the credit \r\nbased on the full cost of the property if the taxpayer is contractually obligated to pay that \r\nentire amount? \r\nA-13: Yes. If the taxpayer is contractually obligated to pay the full cost of the qualifying \r\nproperty, the taxpayer may claim a tax credit based on that amount. \r\nQ-14: May a taxpayer claim a credit for payments of interest owed through financing or \r\nfor expenses such as an origination fee or an extended warranty? \r\nA-14: No. Interest expense is not part of the expenditure for qualifying property under \r\n§ 25C or § 25D. Other miscellaneous costs such as an origination fee or an amount \r\npaid for an extended warranty are also ineligible for the credits. \r\nQ-15: May a taxpayer claim a credit for property that the taxpayer leases rather than \r\npurchases? \r\nA-15: No. A taxpayer must purchase the qualifying property to claim the credits under \r\n§§ 25C and 25D. \r\nQ-16: May a taxpayer claim the credits when the taxpayer does not have a \r\nmanufacturer’s certification that the property is eligible for the credit? \r\nA-16: Yes. A taxpayer may qualify for the credits under §§ 25C and 25D without a \r\nmanufacturer's certification statement if the taxpayer can show that the property meets - 7 -\r\nthe required efficiency standards.

          "text": "\nIt is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless otherwise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of taxpayers are published.\n\nRevenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings to taxpayers or technical advice to Service field offices, identifying details and information of a confidential nature are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements.\n\nRulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and Service personnel and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same.\n\nThe Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows:\n\nPart I.—1986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\nPart II.—Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, Tax Conventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legislation and Related Committee Reports.\n\nPart III.—Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to these subjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Also included in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement).\n\nPart IV.—Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbarment and suspension lists, and announcements.\n\nThe last Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. These monthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and are published in the last Bulletin of each semiannual period.\n\n#  Part I. Rulings and Decisions Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n\n## \n\n#  Part III. Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous\n\n##  Notice 2013–70\n\n### Q&A on Tax Credits for Sections 25C and 25D \n\n##  SECTION 1. PURPOSE\n\nThis notice provides guidance with respect to the credits for nonbusiness energy property under § 25C of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and residential energy efficient property under § 25D of the Code. This notice incorporates the changes made to § 25C by section 710 of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111–312, 124 Stat. 3296 (2010) (the 2010 Act) and to § 25C and § 25D by sections 104 and 401 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112–240, 126 Stat. 2313 (2013) (the 2012 Act).\n\n##  SECTION 2. BACKGROUND\n\nSection 25C allows a credit in an amount equal to the sum of (1) 10 percent of the amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer for qualified energy efficiency improvements installed during the year, and (2) the amount of the residential energy property expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the year.【68†[1]】 The credit is allowed for qualifying property placed in service through December 31, 2013.[2]\n\nSection 25D allows a credit for qualified expenditures made by a taxpayer for residential energy efficient property. Taxpayers may claim the § 25D credit for qualified property placed in service before January 1, 2017.\n\nOn May 11, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (the Service) issued Notice 2009–41, 2009–19 I.R.B. 933, to provide procedures that manufacturers may follow to certify that property satisfies certain conditions of § 25D. The notice defines qualified expenditures for residential energy efficient property based on the definitions in § 25D(d).\n\nOn June 22, 2009, the Service issued Notice 2009–53, 2009–25 I.R.B. 1095, to provide procedures that manufacturers may follow to certify property as being eligible for the credit under § 25C. The notice defines the terms qualified energy efficiency improvements and residential energy property expenditures based on their respective definitions in § 25C(c) and (d) as in effect at that time. The 2010 Act subsequently modified those definitions, however, by updating certain efficiency standards and making other changes. As a result of those modifications, for properties placed in service in 2011, 2012, and 2013, taxpayers must rely on the definitions provided in § 25C(c) and (d) as amended by the 2010 Act.\n\nBoth Notice 2009–41 and Notice 2009–53 provide guidance to taxpayers seeking to claim credits under §§ 25C and 25D in reliance on a manufacturer's certification. The notices provide that for either credit, a taxpayer may rely on a manufacturer's certification that property is eligible for the credit so long as the Service has not withdrawn the manufacturer's right to make the certification.

PURPOSE \n \nThis notice provides guidance with respect to the credits for nonbusiness energy \nproperty under § 25C of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and residential energy \nefficient property under § 25D of the Code.  This notice incorporates the changes made \nto § 25C by section 710 of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, \nand Job Creation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-312, 124 Stat. 3296 (2010) (the 2010 \nAct) and to § 25C and § 25D by sections 104 and 401 of the American Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-240, 126 Stat. 2313 (2013) (the 2012 Act).   \n\n \nSECTION 2. BACKGROUND \n \nSection 25C allows a credit in an amount equal to the sum of (1) 10 percent of the \namount paid or incurred by the taxpayer for qualified energy efficiency improvements \ninstalled during the year, and (2) the amount of the residential energy property \nexpenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the year.1  The credit is allowed for \nqualifying property placed in service through December 31, 2013.2 \n \nSection 25D allows a credit for qualified expenditures made by a taxpayer for residential \nenergy efficient property.  Taxpayers may claim the § 25D credit for qualified property \nplaced in service before January 1, 2017. \n \nOn May 11, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (the Service) issued Notice 2009-41, \n2009-1 C.B. 933, to provide procedures that manufacturers may follow to certify that \n\n                                            \n1 For property placed in service in taxable years beginning in 2009 and 2010, § 25C allowed taxpayers to \nclaim a maximum aggregate credit of $1,500.  However, for years other than taxable years beginning in \n2009 and 2010, § 25C limits the credit allowable to any taxpayer to the excess of $500 over the \naggregate credits allowed to that taxpayer under § 25C for all prior taxable years ending after December \n31, 2005 (including credits claimed in 2009 and 2010).   \n \nThe maximum amount of credit allowed for any taxable year is $50 for any advanced main air circulating \nfan; $150 for any qualified natural gas, propane, or oil furnace or hot water boiler; and $300 for any item \nof energy-efficient building property. In addition, in the case of amounts paid or incurred for exterior \nwindows, including skylights, § 25C limits the credit allowable to any taxpayer to the excess of $200 over \nthe aggregate maximum amount of the credits allowed to that taxpayer for exterior windows under § 25C \nfor all prior taxable years ending after December 31, 2005.  \n2 Section 25C expired on December 31, 2011, but was retroactively extended by the 2012 Act. \n\n\n\n - 2 -\n\nproperty satisfies certain conditions of § 25D.  The notice defines qualified expenditures \nfor residential energy efficient property based on the definitions in § 25D(d).   \n \nOn June 22, 2009, the Service issued Notice 2009-53, 2009-1 C.B. 1095, to provide \nprocedures that manufacturers may follow to certify property as being eligible for the \ncredit under § 25C. The notice defines the terms qualified energy efficiency \nimprovements and residential energy property expenditures based on their respective \ndefinitions in § 25C(c) and (d) as in effect at that time.  The 2010 Act subsequently \nmodified those definitions, however, by updating certain efficiency standards and \nmaking other changes.  As a result of those modifications, for properties placed in \nservice in 2011, 2012, and 2013, taxpayers must rely on the definitions provided in \n§ 25C(c) and (d) as amended by the 2010 Act.   \n \nBoth Notice 2009-41 and Notice 2009-53 provide guidance to taxpayers seeking to \nclaim credits under §§ 25C and 25D in reliance on a manufacturer’s certification.  The \nnotices provide that for either credit, a taxpayer may rely on a manufacturer’s \ncertification that property is eligible for the credit so long as the Service has not \nwithdrawn the manufacturer’s right to make the certification.  The notices further clarify \nthat the Service may determine that a manufacturer’s certification is erroneous; in such \ncases, the Service will withdraw a manufacturer’s right to provide a certification on \nwhich future purchasers of the component or property may rely, and taxpayers \npurchasing the component or property after the date on which the Service publishes an \nannouncement of the withdrawal may not rely on the manufacturer’s certification.     \n \nSECTION 3. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO BOTH § 25C \n(NONBUSINESS ENERGY PROPERTY) AND § 25D (RESIDENTIAL ENERGY \nEFFICIENT PROPERTY) \n \nQ-1:  Are the credits refundable or nonrefundable? \n \nA-1:  Both the § 25C credit and the § 25D credit are nonrefundable personal tax credits.  \nA taxpayer claiming a nonrefundable credit can only use it to decrease or eliminate a \ntax liability.  A taxpayer will not receive a tax refund for any amount that exceeds the \ntaxpayer’s tax liability for the year.   \n \nQ-2:  Is a taxpayer who is subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) eligible to claim \nthe credits? \n \nA-2:  Yes.  A taxpayer who is subject to the AMT is eligible to claim both the § 25C \ncredit and the § 25D credit and may offset the AMT with those credits.   \n \nQ-3:  May a taxpayer carry forward unused credits to another tax year? \n \n\n\n\n - 3 -\n\nA-3:  A taxpayer may not carry forward the § 25C credit.  Thus, if a taxpayer cannot \nclaim all or a portion of the credit in the year in which the related expenditure is treated \nas made, the unused amount of the credit will expire.  However, a taxpayer may carry \nthe § 25D credit forward to future tax years pursuant to § 25D(c).   \n \nQ-4:  Can a taxpayer claim the credits for expenditures incurred for a newly constructed \nhome? \n \nA-4:  A taxpayer can claim the § 25C credit only for qualifying expenditures incurred for \nan existing home or for an addition or renovation to an existing home, and not for a \nnewly constructed home.  In contrast, a taxpayer can claim the § 25D credit for \nqualifying expenditures incurred for either an existing home or a newly constructed \nhome. \n \nQ-5:  May a taxpayer claim the credits in the year of purchase if installation of the \nqualifying property occurs in a later year? \n \nA-5:  No.  A taxpayer may not claim the credits until the year the property is installed. \nThe installation must be completed before the end of 2013 for the § 25C credit and \nbefore the end of 2016 for the § 25D credit. \n \nIn the case of an expenditure incurred in connection with the construction or \nreconstruction of a structure, a taxpayer cannot claim the credits until the year in which \nthe taxpayer’s original use of the constructed or reconstructed structure begins, and the \ntaxpayer’s original use of the constructed or reconstructed structure must begin before \nthe end of 2013 for the § 25C credit and before the end of 2016 for the § 25D credit.    \n \nQ-6:  Are the credits available for improvements made to a second home (for example, \na vacation home or an investment property)? \n \nA-6:  Improvements made to a second home are not eligible for the credit under § 25C.  \nSection 25C(c) and (d) require qualified energy efficiency improvements and residential \nenergy property to be installed in or on a dwelling unit owned and used by the taxpayer \nas the taxpayer’s principal residence (within the meaning of § 121).   \n \n \nWith respect to the credit under § 25D, fuel cell property credits are not available for \nsecond homes. Section 25D(d)(3) requires fuel cell property to be installed on or in \nconnection with a dwelling unit that is used as the taxpayer’s principal residence (within \nthe meaning of § 121). However, a taxpayer may claim a § 25D credit for other \nqualifying properties described in § 25D that are not fuel cell properties (solar electric \nproperty, solar water heating property, small wind energy property, and geothermal heat \npump property) installed in or on a dwelling unit used as a second home or a vacation \n\n\n\n - 4 -\n\nhome by the taxpayer.  But a taxpayer may not claim the § 25D credit for expenditures \nfor improvements made to an investment property, such as rental property, that is not \nalso used as a residence by the taxpayer. \n \nQ-7:  May a taxpayer claim a credit if the qualified property is also used for business \npurposes, such as in a dwelling unit in which the taxpayer also conducts a business? \n \nA-7:  For both credits under §§ 25C and 25D, if a taxpayer uses property solely for \nbusiness purposes, the property will not qualify for the credit.  For a taxpayer who \notherwise qualifies for the credits, but whose use of the qualified property for business \npurposes exceeds 20 percent, §§ 25C(e)(1) and 25D(e)(7) provide that the taxpayer, \nwhen calculating the amount of credit, may take into account only that portion of the \nexpenditures for the property that are properly allocable to use for nonbusiness \npurposes.  A taxpayer who qualifies for the credits and whose use of the qualified \nproperty for business purposes is not more than 20 percent may claim the full credit.     \n \nQ-8:  May a taxpayer include labor costs when calculating the credits? \n \nA-8:  When calculating the § 25C credit, a taxpayer may include the labor costs for the \nonsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of residential energy property such \nas qualifying electric heat pumps, qualifying air conditioners, and qualifying biomass \nstoves.  In contrast, a taxpayer may not include the labor costs for qualified energy \nefficient building envelope components including a qualifying insulation material or \nsystem, exterior window, skylight, exterior door, or roof.  Thus, for an energy efficient \nbuilding envelope component for which a taxpayer pays a fixed price, the taxpayer must \nmake a reasonable allocation between the qualifying cost of the property and the \nnonqualifying labor cost of the installation.  When calculating the § 25D credit, a \ntaxpayer may include the expenditures for labor costs properly allocable to the onsite \npreparation, assembly, or original installation of the qualified property and for piping or \nwiring to interconnect the qualifying property to the home.   \n \nQ-9:  May a taxpayer include sales tax when calculating the amount of expenditures \neligible for the credits? \n \nA-9:  Generally, yes.  Because the sales tax on a qualifying property is part of the \namount paid or incurred, a taxpayer may include the amount of sales tax when \ncalculating both the § 25C credit and the § 25D credit.  However, because labor costs \nfor qualified energy efficient building envelope components in § 25C are ineligible for \nthe credit as described in A-8, to the extent that sales tax is allocable to these labor \ncosts, the sales tax is similarly ineligible for the credit.   \n \nQ-10:  Are tenant-stockholders in a cooperative housing corporation and condominium \nowners eligible to claim the credits? \n\n\n\n - 5 -\n\n \nA-10:  Yes.  Sections 25C(e)(1) and 25D(e)(5) treat a tenant-stockholder (as defined in \n§ 216) in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in § 216) as making his or her \nproportionate share (as defined in § 216(b)(3)) of any expenditures of such corporation.  \nSimilarly, §§ 25C(e)(1) and 25D(e)(6) treat a member of a condominium management \nassociation as having made the individual’s proportionate share of any expenditures of \nsuch association.   \n \nQ-11:  If a government or a public utility provides a subsidy (for example, an incentive, \ngrant, or rebate) to a taxpayer to purchase or install a qualifying property under § 25C or \n§ 25D, is the taxpayer required to reduce the cost basis of the property by the amount of \nthe subsidy received, thereby reducing the amount of the qualified expenditure for which \na credit may be claimed?  \n \nA-11:  The answer depends on the facts that apply to each taxpayer.  \n \n .01 Public Utility.  Under § 136, if a public utility provides (directly or indirectly) a \nsubsidy to a customer for the purchase or installation of any energy conservation \nmeasure, the customer does not include in his or her gross income the value of the \nsubsidy.  As a result, the taxpayer may not claim a credit for the amount of the subsidy \nthat is excluded from the taxpayer’s gross income.  This rule applies whether a third-\nparty contractor receives a subsidy on behalf of the taxpayer or the taxpayer receives \nthe subsidy directly.  Not all payments from a public utility fall within the provisions of \n§ 136.   \n \n\n.02 Rebates.  Rebates generally represent a reduction in the purchase price or \ncost of property, and the taxpayer must exclude the amount of the rebate from the \namount of the qualified expenditure on which the taxpayer calculates the tax credit.  In \ngeneral, in order for a receipt of funds to be considered a nontaxable rebate, the rebate \nmust be based on or related to the cost of the property; the rebate must be received \nfrom someone having a reasonable nexus to the sale of the property, for example, the \nmanufacturer, distributor, or seller/installer; and the rebate must not represent payment \nor compensation for services.   \n \n .03 State Energy-Efficiency Incentives.  A state may provide energy-efficiency \nincentives to encourage taxpayers to purchase qualifying property under § 25C or \n§ 25D.  Section 136 does not address these incentives.  \n \nGenerally, a taxpayer is not required to reduce the purchase price or cost of property \nacquired with a governmental energy-efficiency incentive that is not a rebate.  Many \nstates label their energy-efficiency incentives as rebates, but these incentives may not \nin fact constitute rebates or purchase-price adjustments for federal income tax \npurposes.   \n\n\n\n - 6 -\n\n \nHowever, for qualifying property under § 25C placed in service after 2010 that is \nfinanced in whole or in part by subsidized energy financing, the amount of expenditures \neligible for the § 25C credit does not include any expenditures that are made from \nsubsidized energy financing.  Subsidized energy financing means financing provided \nunder a federal, state, or local program a principal purpose of which is to provide \nsubsidized financing for projects designed to conserve or produce energy.  \n \nQ-12:  If a taxpayer is eligible to claim a state tax credit related to the purchase of \nqualifying property under § 25C or § 25D, is the taxpayer required to reduce the cost \nbasis of the property by the amount of the state tax credit claimed, thereby reducing the \namount of the qualified expenditure for which the § 25C or § 25D credit may be \nclaimed? \n   \nA-12:  No.  The taxpayer does not reduce the amount of the qualified expenditure by the \namount of the state tax credit claimed in calculating the credits.    \n \nQ-13:  If a taxpayer finances the purchase of a qualifying property under § 25C or § 25D \nthrough the seller of the property, may the taxpayer calculate the amount of the credit \nbased on the full cost of the property if the taxpayer is contractually obligated to pay that \nentire amount?    \n \nA-13:  Yes.  If the taxpayer is contractually obligated to pay the full cost of the qualifying \nproperty, the taxpayer may claim a tax credit based on that amount.     \n \nQ-14:  May a taxpayer claim a credit for payments of interest owed through financing or \nfor expenses such as an origination fee or an extended warranty? \n \nA-14:  No.  Interest expense is not part of the expenditure for qualifying property under \n§ 25C or § 25D.  Other miscellaneous costs such as an origination fee or an amount \npaid for an extended warranty are also ineligible for the credits. \n \nQ-15:  May a taxpayer claim a credit for property that the taxpayer leases rather than \npurchases?    \n \nA-15:  No.  A taxpayer must purchase the qualifying property to claim the credits under \n§§ 25C and 25D.   \n \nQ-16:  May a taxpayer claim the credits when the taxpayer does not have a \nmanufacturer’s certification that the property is eligible for the credit?   \n \nA-16:  Yes.  A taxpayer may qualify for the credits under §§ 25C and 25D without a \nmanufacturer's certification statement if the taxpayer can show that the property meets \n\n\n\n - 7 -\n\nthe required efficiency standards.  A taxpayer should retain documentation sufficient to \nestablish the entitlement to, and amount of, any credit.   \n \nSECTION 4. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATING TO § 25C (NONBUSINESS \nENERGY PROPERTY) \n \nQ-17:  If a taxpayer claimed a § 25C credit in the amount of $1,000 in 2009, is the \ntaxpayer eligible to claim additional credits for qualifying § 25C property expenditures \nmade in 2013? \n \nA-17:  No.  Prior law allowed taxpayers to claim an aggregate credit of $1,500 under \n§ 25C for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.  However, the 2010 Act amended § 25C(b) to \nprovide a lifetime limitation of $500 of which no more than $200 may be attributable to \nexpenditures on windows.  Thus, a taxpayer who has claimed less than $500 in total for \nall previous years is eligible for the § 25C credit in 2013.  For example, a taxpayer who \nclaimed a § 25C credit in the amount of $100 in 2006 and $50 in 2007 for non-window \nexpenditures and claimed no § 25C credit in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 is eligible to \nclaim up to $350 as a § 25C credit for 2013 (of which no more than $200 may be \nattributable to expenditures on windows).   \n \nQ-18:  Is a sealant such as caulk or weather stripping an insulation material or system \neligible for the credit? \n \nA-18:  Section 25C(c) defines a building envelope component as any insulation material \nor system that is specifically and primarily designed to reduce the heat loss or gain of a \ndwelling unit when installed in or on such dwelling unit and meets the prescriptive \ncriteria for such material or system established by the 2009 International Energy \nConservation Code (IECC), including supplements, as in effect on February 17, 2009.    \n \nSection 402.4 of the 2009 IECC addresses components to reduce air leakage.  Section \n402.4.1 provides, in part, that the building thermal envelope must be durably sealed to \nlimit infiltration.  The following must be caulked, gasketed, weatherstripped or otherwise \nsealed with an air barrier material, suitable film, or solid material:  \n \n1. All joints, seams, and penetrations. \n2. Site-built windows, doors and skylights. \n3. Openings between window and door assemblies and their respective jambs and \nframing. \n4. Utility penetrations. \n5. Dropped ceilings or chases adjacent to the thermal envelope. \n6. Knee walls. \n7. Walls and ceilings separating a garage from conditioned spaces. \n8. Behind tubs and showers on exterior walls. \n\n\n\n - 8 -\n\n9. Common walls between dwelling units. \n10. Attic access openings. \n11. Rim joist junction. \n12. Other sources of infiltration.3  \n \nThus, if a taxpayer uses an air barrier material, suitable film, or solid material such as \ncaulk or weatherstripping to seal the areas of a principal residence listed above, the \ntaxpayer may claim the § 25C credit with respect to amounts paid for such sealant as \nlong as the taxpayer satisfies the other requirements of § 25C. \n \nQ-19:  The manufacturer of a radiant barrier would like to certify that its product is \neligible for the § 25C credit.  Can the manufacturer refer to the U-factor as an alternative \nto the R-value when determining if the requirements of the 2009 IECC are satisfied? \n \nA-19:  Yes.  Section 25C requires that an insulation material or system meet the \nprescriptive criteria for such material or system, established by the 2009 IECC, as in \neffect on February 17, 2009.  The 2009 IECC established criteria for insulating materials \nto reach certain minimum R-values, which measures the material’s ability to stop heat \ntransfer.  Instead of the R-value, section 402.1.3 of the 2009 IECC allows taxpayers to \nuse the U-factor, which measures the amount of heat transmitted through a given \nassembly, as an alternative criterion.  Thus, a manufacturer of a radiant barrier can use \nthe U-factor instead of the R-value if measured in compliance with the provisions of \nsection 402.1.3 of the 2009 IECC, as in effect on February 17, 2009.    \n \nQ-20:  Is a window sash replacement kit considered an exterior window under \n§ 25C(c)(2)(B) that is eligible for the § 25C credit? \n \nA-20:  Yes.  Although window sash replacement kits are generally comprised of only the \nsashes, glazing, and adjacent parts and are not whole windows, the Service considers \nthe kit an exterior window for purposes of the credit.  To be eligible for the credit, \npursuant to § 25C(c)(1), the window sash replacement kit must meet the requirements \nof the Energy Star program. \n \nSECTION 5. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATING TO § 25D ( RESIDENTIAL \nENERGY EFFICIENT PROPERTY) \n \n.01 General Questions. \n \nQ-21:  A taxpayer may claim a § 25D credit if a qualifying property is installed in or on \nan existing home or a newly constructed home.  In the case of a newly constructed \n\n                                            \n3 Source: 2009 International Energy Conservation Code, copyright 2009.  Washington, DC: International \nCode Council.  Reproduced with permission. www.iccsafe.org. \n\n\n\n - 9 -\n\nhome, how does the taxpayer determine the cost of the qualifying property under \n§ 25D?  \n \nA-21:  The taxpayer may request that the homebuilder make a reasonable allocation or \nthe taxpayer may use any other reasonable method to determine the cost of the \nproperty that is eligible for the § 25D credit. See Q&A 8 for information concerning labor \ncosts.     \n \nQ-22:  A homebuilder constructed a house in which qualifying § 25D property was \ninstalled in year 1.  The house was not sold and used as a residence until year 2.  May \na taxpayer that buys the home for use as a residence in year 2 claim the § 25D credit? \n \nA-22:  Yes.  As long as the taxpayer begins to use the house as a residence before \n2017, the taxpayer may claim the § 25D credit in year 2.  Section 25D(e)(8) treats an \nexpenditure in connection with the construction or reconstruction of a structure as made \nwhen the taxpayer begins to originally use the constructed or reconstructed structure as \na residence.   \n \nQ-23:  Same facts as Q-22, but the house was a model home, and the qualifying \nproperty was used during the time it was marketed for sale.  May a taxpayer claim the \n§ 25D credit in year 2? \n \nA-23:  Yes.  The expenditure is treated as made when the use of the structure as a \nresidence begins. \n \nQ-24:  In 2010, Taxpayer A purchases and moves into a newly constructed home that \ncontains qualifying § 25D property.  Taxpayer A claims the § 25D credit in 2010.  In \n2013, Taxpayer A sells the home to Taxpayer B.  Is Taxpayer B eligible for a credit on \nthe same § 25D property?  \n \nA-24:  No.  Section 25D(e)(8) generally treats an expenditure as made when the original \ninstallation of the qualifying property is completed.  In the case of an expenditure \nincurred in connection with the construction or reconstruction of a structure, the \nexpenditure is treated as made when the original use of the constructed or \nreconstructed structure as a residence by the taxpayer begins.  Thus, only the taxpayer \nwho begins the original use of the constructed or reconstructed structure as a residence \nor the taxpayer using the home as a residence when the property was originally \ninstalled is eligible for the tax credit. \n \n.02 Solar Electric Property \n \nQ-25:  If a taxpayer installs solar electric property other than directly on the taxpayer’s \nhome, may the taxpayer claim the § 25D credit?     \n\n\n\n - 10 -\n\n \nA-25:  Section 25D(d)(2) defines a qualified solar electric property expenditure, in part, \nas an expenditure for property that uses solar energy to generate electricity for use in a \ndwelling unit that is used as a residence by the taxpayer.  Therefore, if solar panels that \nare not directly located on the taxpayer’s home use solar energy to generate electricity \ndirectly for the taxpayer’s home the taxpayer may claim the § 25D credit.   \n \nQ-26:  A taxpayer purchases solar panels that are placed on an off-site solar array and \nconnected to the local public utility’s electrical grid that supplies electricity to the \ntaxpayer’s residence.  The taxpayer enters into a direct contractual arrangement with \nthe local public utility that supplies electricity to the taxpayer’s residence to allow the \ntaxpayer to provide electricity to the grid using a net metering system that measures the \namount of electricity produced by the taxpayer’s solar panels and transmitted to the grid \nand the amount of electricity used by the taxpayer’s residence and drawn from the grid.  \nThe contract states that the taxpayer owns the energy transmitted by the solar panels to \nthe utility grid until drawn from the grid at his residence.  Absent unusual circumstances, \nthe panels will not generate electricity for a specified period in excess of the amount \nexpected to be consumed at the taxpayer's residence during that specified period.  Can \nthe taxpayer claim the § 25D credit? \n \nA-26:  Yes.  Section 25D(d)(2) defines a qualified solar electric property expenditure, in \npart, as an expenditure for property that uses solar energy to generate electricity for use \nin a dwelling unit used as a residence by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer’s expenditure for \noff-site solar panels under this type of contractual arrangement with a local public utility \nthat supplies electricity to the taxpayer’s residence meets the definition of qualified solar \nelectric property expenditure.   \n \nQ-27:  A taxpayer purchases and installs solar electric property to generate electricity \nfor the taxpayer's own home and to allow the taxpayer to sell excess electricity to a \nutility.  Unlike the taxpayer in Q-26, this taxpayer generates more than a minimal \namount of excess electricity.  Does this taxpayer qualify for the § 25D credit on the full \namount of the solar electric property? \n \nA-27:  No.  Under these facts, the taxpayer may not claim the § 25D credit for the full \namount of the solar electric property expenditure because the property not only \ngenerates electricity for use in the taxpayer's home, but it also generates electricity for \nsale by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer may only claim the § 25D credit for the portion of \nthe solar electric property expenditure that relates to the electricity generated for use in \nthe taxpayer’s home.  In addition, the taxpayer may be able to claim the § 48 credit for a \nportion of the solar electric property expenditure if the requirements of § 48 are \nsatisfied.    \n \nQ-28:  Is an expenditure for a solar air heater eligible for the § 25D credit?   \n\n\n\n - 11 -\n\n \nA-28:  No.  Section 25D(d)(2) defines a qualified solar electric property expenditure, in \npart, as an expenditure for property that uses solar energy to generate electricity for use \nin a dwelling unit.  Section 25D(d)(1) defines a qualified solar water heating property \nexpenditure, in part, as an expenditure for property to heat water for use in a dwelling \nunit if at least half of the energy used by such property for such purpose is derived from \nthe sun.  A solar air heater that warms air and does not generate electricity or heat \nwater is not eligible for the § 25D credit.  \n \nQ-29:  Is an expenditure for a solar powered exhaust fan eligible for the § 25D credit? \n \nA-29:  Only the component part of a property that actually generates electricity for the \ndwelling unit is eligible for the § 25D credit.  If a solar panel on a fan generates \nelectricity to power the fan for use in the dwelling unit, the cost of the panel component \nmay be eligible for the § 25D credit if all the requirements of § 25D are met; however, \nthe entire cost of the fan is not eligible.  Additionally, § 25D(e)(1) specifically allows \ncertain labor costs to be taken into account when calculating the credit.  Under this \nprovision, a taxpayer may take into account only the labor costs allocable to the \nqualifying component when calculating the credit.   \n \n.03 Small Wind Energy Property. \n \nQ-30:  May a taxpayer claim the § 25D credit for the purchase of small wind energy \nproperty made from remanufactured wind turbines?  \n \nA-30:  Yes.  Section 25D does not require that the original use of the qualified property \nor parts of the property begin with the taxpayer.   \n \n.04 Geothermal Heat Pump Property. \n \nQ-31:  A taxpayer contacts a seller to inquire about the installation of a geothermal heat \npump to heat his home.  The seller/installer informs the taxpayer that the following items \nmust be installed in addition to the geothermal heat pump: heat exchange equipment in \nthe ground outside of the house, a distribution system for the home, and a back-up \nemergency heating or cooling system.  Which of these costs, if any, are eligible for the \n§ 25D credit?   \n \nA-31:  Only the cost of the heat exchange equipment in the ground outside the house \ncan be eligible for the § 25D credit.  The costs for the distribution system for the home \nand a back-up emergency heating or cooling system are not eligible for the credit \nbecause they are not incurred for qualified geothermal heat pump property.  Section \n25D(d)(5)(B) defines qualified geothermal heat pump property as any equipment that (1) \nuses the ground or ground water as a thermal energy source to heat the dwelling unit or \n\n\n\n - 12 -\n\nas a thermal energy sink to cool such dwelling unit, and (2) meets the requirements of \nthe Energy Star program in effect at the time that the expenditure for such equipment is \nmade.  Section 25D(e)(1) provides that expenditures for piping and wiring to \ninterconnect qualified property to a dwelling unit are eligible for the § 25D credit.  \nHowever, nothing in § 25D extends the credit to other auxiliary equipment such as \ndistribution systems within the dwelling unit or backup emergency heating and cooling \nsystems. \n \nQ-32:  Is a manufacturer of geothermal heat pump property that provides a certification \npursuant to Notice 2009-41 required to become an Energy Star partner?    \n \nA-32:  No.  A manufacturer of geothermal heat pump property is not required to become \nan Energy Star partner to provide a certification pursuant to Notice 2009-41.  However, \nthe geothermal heat pump property must meet the requirements of the Energy Star \nprogram in effect at the time the taxpayer purchases the property.  Furthermore, any \nmanufacturer that provides a certification must retain in its records documentation \nestablishing that the property meets those requirements and, upon request, make such \ndocumentation available for inspection by the Service. \n \nSECTION 6.

            "In **Notice 2013-70**, roofing costs are addressed in **Q&A 8** (Section 3) under labor costs for energy-efficient building envelope components. Specifically, it states that labor costs related to the installation of energy-efficient roofing do **not** qualify for the tax credit under §25C. This means that while energy-efficient materials themselves (such as those designed to reduce heat loss or gain) can qualify, the labor costs for installing such materials on the roof do not qualify for the credit. \n\nHowever, under §25D, labor costs associated with the onsite preparation, assembly, or installation of **solar electric property** (including the integration of the system with the roof) are eligible for the tax credit.\n\nThus, if a roof repair or installation is integral to supporting the solar panels, the costs associated with the portion of the roof that directly accommodates the solar panels may be considered part of the overall qualified expenditure for the solar tax credit.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the full document: **Notice 2013-70**【19†source】."
