Embarrassing for Ryan to have to see...\r\n\r\nimage.png\r\n\r\nI get it, I understand how much is in the pipeline, and how easy it is for 1 more month, to just keep dripping in to \"just 1 more month\" (Pomeian, Joppatowne same boat).  But we have been holding our breath for the big break out month after month the entire year.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, the results are the results, and I just think there could be so much more effort being put in.  I can't be the one driving all the initiatives like the EOS accountability metrics, pitch process, and a marketing plan.  \r\n\r\nI know you are working hard, just not sure if it is on all the right things. I was very surprised the other day when you said \"so are we targeting developers again for EPC work?\".  I have said this a few times to you months ago that you should focus on developers, and let Shane and Phil hit the direct to customer.   It doesn't sound like much effort was really made there.\r\n\r\nI can keep defending all the work we are doing, but at some point Mike Kirby is going to come around asking really hard questions. \r\n\r\nLet keep getting dialed in, but we HAVE to have a strong Q4 here to close out the year."

            "This is my proposed response.  Am I respectfully and honestly addressing his concerns?  My goal is not to give excuses but state facts and contextualize them.  My ultimate goal is to be very honest but in a collaborative, constructive way: I\"m reading between the lines here and assuming that the shit is hitting the fan somewhere and you're having to make excuses again as to why this department is performing so poorly.  Tonight I will put together a state of the union and send it to you for discussion tomorrow.  \r\n\r\nHere are some objective truths.  No opinions, no nuance - truth.\r\n\r\nOur goals were based on my prior performance, not this team in this environment.  They're wrong, and having them serve as the benchmark by which we are judged is also wrong.  \r\n\r\nWe have switched strategies no less than three times this year.  What constituted a good project in April has now become undesirable in August.  Building, managing, and closing a pipeline when the viability of the opportunities within it changes month by month is inefficient and ineffective.  Every prospective project is evaluated under a new set of criteria leaving us guessing.  Small projects = bad.  Small projects = great.  DSD BGE Community Solar = Great.  DSD BGE Community Solar = Terrible.  Cash/loan projects = terrible.  Cash / loan projects = good.\r\n\r\nPutting so many eggs in the DSD basket was a mistake.  I am seeking alternate sources of funding.  \r\n\r\nMy shortcomings are numerous and involve several incomplete initiatives.  Marketing, sales playbook, lead generation, EOS Performance metrics.  They're all sitting in various stages of completion.  \r\n\r\nI spend almost all of my time as a sales manager / sales leader / Senior Sales Rep.  This is the quickest path to revenue.  There would be no ARC without me.  My level of effort on this project has been high.\r\n\r\nPhil is doing well and is still learning.  I always need to step in at crucial moments.  He is an excellent member of my team however requires a lot of coaching and oversight.  At this point, this is the highest and best use of my time since his pipeline is this strongest and he needs the support.  \r\n\r\nShane is not a good fit for this role and I do not think we will see much more out of his pipeline, if anything, for the rest of the year.  It is important to note that I am really happy with his attitude turnaround and level of effort.  He needs direction and I'm working hard to give it to him.\r\n\r\nMy team is grossly under-resourced in every conceivable way.  I attempted to address this in May and nothing has changed.  I do take responsibility for a lot of this.  I was told to build it, ask for it, and we would get it.  This project is daunting since nothing in this organization is built to handle or support my team.  It starts from Salesforce and works its way up.   You are truly getting so much more than what you are paying for here.\r\n\r\nSo now for some good truths:\r\n\r\nContracts are being signed on Phil's ARC, and I am pushing hard for a signed EPCA Friday.  You have no idea how hard this was.  You don't.  \r\n\r\nPhil has a good pipeline and I think we will see one or two come over the line.  Downeast is going to pull all of their offers and recalculate so that's not going to help, and DSD is now only good for bigger projects so that will require some reworking but I am working closely with him to get a few of them over the line.  \r\n\r\nYou have an excellent team here and I am going to stand up for them and their efforts and take all of the bullets.  Every single one.  They have the toughest job in the company as far as I'm concerned.  I get out of bed in the morning to give them everything I have since it's the only thing they get.\r\n\r\nLet's talk more about this tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r"

            "Your proposed response strikes a balance between addressing the CRO’s concerns honestly while demonstrating leadership and taking ownership of the situation. Here’s a breakdown of how well it achieves your goals:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Honesty**: You are transparent about the challenges, including your own shortcomings and the limitations of the team. This shows humility and responsibility, which is important to maintain trust.\n  \n2. **Contextualization**: You provide a clear, fact-based explanation of the constantly shifting goals and strategies, offering context for why results may have fallen short. This gives your CRO a better understanding of the external factors impacting performance.\n\n3. **Ownership**: You take responsibility for key initiatives that remain incomplete (marketing, playbook, EOS metrics) without making excuses, which shows accountability.\n\n4. **Collaboration**: By offering to send a \"state of the union\" and requesting a further discussion, you are inviting dialogue and collaboration, which positions you as solution-oriented.\n\n5. **Support for Your Team**: You stand up for your team’s efforts and clarify the resources and support they need, while also pointing out individual areas of development for Phil and Shane. This is constructive and shows that you are committed to their growth.\n\n### Areas to Consider:\n1. **Tone on the Goals**: Your statement that the goals are wrong might come off as defensive. It’s fine to challenge them, but you might reframe it more diplomatically. For example, \"The goals were ambitious based on prior performance in a different environment. I believe we need to reassess the benchmarks in light of current market realities.\"\n\n2. **Shifting Strategies**: You highlight the shifting strategy multiple times, which is important. However, you could focus a little more on how you're adapting to those changes moving forward. CROs want solutions just as much as they want explanations.\n\n3. **Under-Resourcing**: You rightfully point out the resourcing issues, but stating \"nothing has changed\" could be softened slightly. Consider offering a concrete proposal for resources: “I attempted to address this in May, and I believe we need to revisit this now with a clearer plan to resolve these gaps.”\n\n4. **Shane’s Performance**: You are direct about Shane not being a good fit, which is honest. However, it might help to also offer a plan for how you will either help him improve or transition his role if it’s necessary. A CRO will want to see solutions for underperformance.\n\n### Suggested Adjustments:\nYou might want to adjust a few points to soften the defensiveness while still being firm:\n\n- “Our goals were ambitious and set based on my previous performance, but the current market and team dynamics require us to re-evaluate these targets to ensure they align with our capabilities and opportunities.\"\n  \n- “Switching strategies multiple times has created inefficiencies. While I understand the need to adapt, we need to establish a clear, consistent focus moving forward to avoid these challenges. I’m working to build a more adaptable but stable pipeline.”\n\nThese adjustments maintain your honesty but make the response slightly more constructive.\n\nOverall, your message is respectful, honest, and collaborative, but with a few slight tone adjustments, it could feel even more solution-focused while keeping the accountability intact."

            "Here's a revised version of your response, incorporating the suggested adjustments for tone and focus:\n\n---\n\n**Subject: State of the Union – Commercial Sales**\n\nMark, \n\nI’m reading between the lines and can sense that there’s mounting pressure somewhere, and you're likely in a position where you're having to defend our department’s performance. I’ll put together a detailed state of the union tonight and send it to you for discussion tomorrow. \n\nHere are some objective truths—no opinions, no nuance—just facts.\n\n1. **Goals and Performance**:  \nThe goals were ambitious and set based on my previous performance, not this team’s capabilities in the current environment. While I understand the need to set high expectations, it’s clear that these goals don’t reflect the reality we are operating in, and using them as our primary benchmark is leading to misaligned expectations. I believe we should re-evaluate these benchmarks to better align with the current market and team dynamics.\n\n2. **Shifting Strategies**:  \nWe’ve switched strategies multiple times this year, which has made building, managing, and closing a pipeline increasingly challenging. What constituted a good project earlier in the year is now seen as undesirable, creating inefficiencies. Each month, prospective projects are evaluated under new criteria—small projects, DSD BGE Community Solar, and cash/loan projects—leading to constant recalibration. While I understand the need for adaptability, we need to establish a clearer, more consistent focus moving forward to avoid these challenges.\n\n3. **DSD Over-reliance**:  \nI agree that putting so many eggs in the DSD basket was a mistake. I’m actively seeking alternate sources of funding to mitigate this risk.\n\n4. **Incomplete Initiatives**:  \nI acknowledge my shortcomings with respect to several incomplete initiatives: marketing, sales playbook, lead generation, and EOS performance metrics. They are all in various stages of completion, and I take full responsibility for this. I’ll outline a plan for how we can push these forward.\n\n5. **Current Role Focus**:  \nMost of my time has been spent in the role of sales manager, leader, and senior sales rep, which is the quickest path to revenue. Without my involvement, the ARC wouldn’t have progressed as it has, and my level of effort on this project has been significant.\n\n6. **Team Assessment**:\n   - **Phil**: Phil is performing well and still learning. While I need to step in at critical moments, he’s an excellent team member who requires ongoing coaching and support. I believe this is the best use of my time right now, given that his pipeline is strong and he needs that extra guidance.\n   - **Shane**: Shane has shown a positive attitude shift and improved effort, but I do not foresee significant contributions from his pipeline for the remainder of the year. I’m working closely with him, but I also believe we may need to reconsider his fit for the role moving forward.\n\n7. **Resource Gaps**:  \nMy team is severely under-resourced in every conceivable way. I raised this in May, and while I understand the challenges, we need to address this if we want to build sustainable success. I take responsibility for pushing this more effectively. I was told to build and ask for what we need, and I’ll provide a clearer roadmap to solve these gaps, starting from Salesforce and working upward. You’re getting far more than what you’re paying for with this team, but we need better infrastructure and support.\n\n**Positive Developments**:\n- Contracts are being signed on Phil’s ARC, and I’m pushing hard for a signed EPCA by Friday. You have no idea how challenging this has been, but we’re getting there.\n- Phil’s pipeline is strong, and while Downeast recalculating their offers won’t help, we’re working hard to close one or two deals. I’m also recalibrating with DSD for bigger projects.\n- You have an excellent team here, and I’m standing by them. They have the toughest job in the company, and I’m committed to giving them everything I have.\n\nLet’s talk more tomorrow. I want to ensure we finish this year strong and position commercial for a successful 2025.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis revision maintains your honesty and accountability while softening some of the more defensive tones and offering constructive solutions. It emphasizes the need for strategic clarity and resourcing while also highlighting the progress being made."

            "Your response does a great job of owning your shortcomings, being transparent, and offering solutions while highlighting the challenges you and your team face. It doesn't come across as excuse-making, but instead, it demonstrates that you're trying to be constructive, realistic, and focused on improving the situation. However, I do think there are a couple of points in the CRO's emails that you could address more explicitly to ensure you're fully aligned with his concerns and showing accountability. Here's what you might consider adding or adjusting:\n\n### 1. **Effort on Key Initiatives (EOS, Marketing, Pitch Process)**:\nIn his first email, the CRO mentioned that more effort could be put into key initiatives like EOS accountability metrics, the pitch process, and marketing plans. While you did acknowledge your incomplete initiatives, you could go a bit deeper into how you'll ensure these are prioritized moving forward. \n\n**Suggested Addition**:\n- \"You mentioned needing more focus on EOS accountability, pitch processes, and a marketing plan. I agree these areas haven’t received the attention they need, and that's on me. I’ll set clearer timelines for each of these and make sure they don’t remain incomplete as we move into Q4. I’ll provide a progress report on these initiatives next week.\"\n\n### 2. **Clear Direction on Developer Targeting**:\nIn his first email, your CRO expressed surprise that there was confusion about targeting developers for EPC work. He indicated he had communicated this months ago. It might help to address this miscommunication directly and assure him it won’t happen again.\n\n**Suggested Addition**:\n- \"Regarding the confusion around developer targeting for EPC work, I take full responsibility. I misunderstood the initial direction but will ensure that my focus remains there moving forward, allowing Shane and Phil to prioritize direct-to-customer opportunities as you suggested.\"\n\n### 3. **A Sense of Urgency for Q4**:\nThe CRO’s second email emphasizes the importance of Q4 performance and pipeline development for 2025. You do touch on this, but you could highlight your action plan for delivering in Q4 with more specificity. Show how you are actively pushing for immediate results.\n\n**Suggested Addition**:\n- \"I understand the urgency you’ve placed on Q4 to secure a strong pipeline for 2025. We’re currently pushing hard to close key deals, including Phil’s ARC and a potential EPCA by Friday. I’ll make sure Q4 is a strong quarter, and I’ll provide you with weekly updates on where we stand with the pipeline to ensure we don’t have any surprises.\"\n\n### 4. **Balancing Shortcomings and Ownership**:\nYou do a good job owning up to where things have fallen short, but I see you're concerned about sounding like you’re making excuses. To avoid this, you could emphasize that while there have been challenges, you remain confident that with the right focus and adjustments, the department will meet its goals. Make it clear that you recognize your role in improving things but also want to ensure your CRO is aware of the external and organizational factors limiting progress.\n\n**Suggested Adjustment**:\n- “While I fully acknowledge my role in some of these shortcomings, I’m committed to doing everything I can to address them quickly. At the same time, I want to ensure that we have the right resources and a consistent strategy in place to make meaningful progress. I’m confident that with better alignment, we can deliver the results you’re expecting.”\n\n### 5. **No Excuses, Just Facts**:\nYou already do a good job sticking to facts, but perhaps one more line emphasizing that you're not making excuses could help. Something like:\n\n**Suggested Addition**:\n- \"I want to be clear that none of this is meant as an excuse. I take full ownership of where we are today, and I’m committed to turning things around as quickly as possible.\"\n\n### Summary:\nBy adding these points, you’ll directly address every concern the CRO raised in his emails, showing that you’re fully engaged and solution-focused. You’ll be making it clear that while you’re owning your role, the team’s success also depends on consistent strategy, proper resourcing, and support.\n\nOverall, your response doesn’t sound like excuse-making, but by explicitly addressing every point, especially around key initiatives and developer targeting, you’ll ensure that it’s seen as proactive and solution-driven."

            "Certainly! Here’s your revised response, incorporating all of the additional points while keeping it respectful, honest, and in line with your original tone:\n\n---\n\n**Subject: State of the Union – Commercial Sales**\n\nMark,\n\nI’m reading between the lines and assuming that something's hitting the fan again, and you’re having to make excuses as to why our department’s performance isn’t where it needs to be. Tonight, I’ll put together a more detailed state of the union and send it to you for discussion tomorrow.\n\nHere are some objective truths—no opinions, no nuance, just facts:\n\n1. **Goals and Performance**:  \nOur goals were ambitious, based on my previous performance, not the realities of this team and this market. Those benchmarks are outdated, and continuing to hold us to them without adjustment is setting us up for failure. I’m not suggesting we lower expectations, but we need a realignment based on where we are today and where the opportunities are. I’m happy to work with you on this, but it’s clear that some course correction is needed.\n\n2. **Shifting Strategies**:  \nWe’ve changed our strategy multiple times this year. What constituted a “good project” in April was no longer desirable in August. This has made building, managing, and closing a pipeline inefficient and inconsistent. Every prospective project is being evaluated under new criteria month by month, leaving us scrambling. Small projects = bad, then small projects = great. DSD BGE Community Solar = Great, then DSD BGE Community Solar = Terrible. It’s tough to gain traction when the targets keep moving. I get why we needed to adapt, but if we don’t have a clear focus going into Q4, we’re going to keep spinning our wheels.\n\n3. **Effort on Key Initiatives**:  \nYou’re right—I haven’t put enough effort into critical areas like EOS accountability, the pitch process, and a solid marketing plan. I own that. These initiatives have been sitting unfinished, and I know they’re important. I’m laying out a clear plan to get these back on track and will provide timelines to hold myself accountable. I’ll make sure these don’t remain incomplete as we go into Q4.\n\n4. **Developer Targeting**:  \nI completely misunderstood the direction about focusing on developers for EPC work, and that’s on me. I didn’t connect the dots until recently, but moving forward, I’ll stay laser-focused on developers as discussed, while Shane and Phil prioritize direct-to-customer opportunities. You won’t have to remind me of this again.\n\n5. **DSD Over-reliance**:  \nI agree that we relied too much on DSD, and it was a mistake. I’m already looking at alternate sources of funding to diversify and ensure we’re not putting all our eggs in one basket again.\n\n6. **Incomplete Initiatives**:  \nMarketing, the sales playbook, lead generation, and EOS metrics are all in various stages of completion, and I take responsibility for them not being where they should be. I’ll be sending you updates and timelines on how I plan to push each of these forward in the coming weeks.\n\n7. **Resource Gaps**:  \nMy team is significantly under-resourced, and I raised this in May, but nothing has changed. I was told to build it, ask for it, and we’d get it. But it’s daunting trying to move forward when nothing in this organization is built to support my team—starting from Salesforce and working up. I take accountability for not pushing harder on this, but the fact remains: We’re delivering far more than we’re resourced for, and that needs to be addressed if we’re going to meet these high expectations.\n\n8. **Current Role Focus**:  \nMost of my time is spent as a sales manager, leader, and senior sales rep. This is the quickest path to revenue, and there wouldn’t be an ARC project without my involvement. My level of effort on this project has been high because it needs to be. \n\n9. **Team Assessment**:\n   - **Phil**: Phil is performing well, but he’s still learning. I often need to step in at critical moments, and while this takes up my time, it’s the best use of my energy right now because his pipeline is strong, and he needs that extra support.\n   - **Shane**: Shane has turned his attitude around and is putting in the effort, but I don’t expect much from his pipeline for the rest of the year. I’m working with him closely, but I think we may need to reconsider his fit for this role long-term.\n\n**Positive Developments**:\n- Contracts are being signed on Phil’s ARC, and I’m pushing hard for a signed EPCA by Friday. This has been a massive lift, and we’re on the verge of closing it.\n- Phil’s pipeline is strong, and while Downeast pulling their offers won’t help, we’re still aiming to close a couple of deals. DSD is only viable for bigger projects now, so I’m working with Phil to adapt.\n- I stand by my team. They have the hardest job in the company, and I get out of bed every day to give them everything I have because that’s what they deserve. I’ll continue to take the bullets for them because they’re working hard and doing everything they can in this tough environment.\n\n**Looking Ahead**:\nI’m not making excuses here—I fully own where we are and the gaps we need to fill. I also understand the urgency of Q4. We need a strong quarter to set ourselves up for 2025, and I’ll be giving you weekly updates so we stay aligned on progress. I’m confident that with a clear focus, the right resources, and the adjustments I’ve outlined, we can make Q4 count.\n\nLet’s talk more tomorrow. I’m ready to do whatever it takes to finish this year strong and make 2025 a success for commercial.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis revision keeps your direct, honest tone, while addressing all the points your CRO raised and staying focused on accountability without sounding like you’re making excuses. You clearly own the situation but also highlight the resourcing and strategic shifts that have impacted performance. It frames your response as collaborative and solution-driven."
