The 【38†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program】 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District’s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n【77†Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report】\n\n【78†Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports】 \n\n  * 【79†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 1, 2023】\n  * 【80†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 2, 2022】\n  * 【81†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 3, 2021】\n  * 【82†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020†edocket.dcpsc.org】\n  * 【83†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019】\n  * 【84†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018】\n  * 【85†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017】\n  * 【86†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017】\n  * 【87†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016】\n  * 【88†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015】\n  * 【89†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015",

Under the RPS, electricity suppliers must buy 100% of their power from renewable sources by 2032, with 15% coming from local solar power by 2041 (【46†Local Solar Expansion Act of 2022†code.dccouncil.gov】). Through the RPS, the District can avoid a substantial portion of its projected 2032 GHG emissions. However, a key issue here will be to ensure that while more renewable energy is being added to the District’s energy mix, electricity rates remain affordable for both District businesses and residents.\n\nIn addition to the RPS, the CEDC Plan lays out other strategies for increasing local renewable energy generation, and encourages the development of innovative neighborhood-scale energy resources within the District.\n\nInitiatives\n\n  * 【47†Buy Green Power】\n  * 【48†Clean Energy DC】\n  * 【49†Solar Initiatives】   \n- 【50†Solar for All】\n  * 【51†Sustainable DC†www.sustainabledc.org】\n  * 【52†Public Service Commission PowerPath DC†dcpsc.org】\n\nResources and Background\n\n  * 【53†Renewable Portfolio Standard FAQs†dcpsc.org】\n  * 【54†PSC Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard†dcpsc.org】\n\nEducation\n\n  * 【55†Electric Vehicle Grand Prix】\n\nContact TTY: \n\n711 \n\nRelated Content: \n\n【10†Energy in the District】\n\n  * 【56†Amharic (አማርኛ)】\n  * 【57†Chinese (中文)】\n  * 【58†French (Français)】\n  * 【59†Korean (한국어)】\n  * 【60†Spanish (Español)】\n  * 【61†Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)】\n\n[Image 3: Logo for the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia - Muriel Bowser, Mayor]\n\nOffice Hours  \nMonday - Friday 9 am to 5 pm\n\nConnect With Us  \n1200 First Street, NE  \nWashington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: 【62†(202) 535-2600†tel:202-535-2600】  \nFax: (202) 535-2881  \nTTY: (800) 855-1000  \nEmail: 【63†[email protected]】\n\n【64†Ask the Director†dcforms.dc.gov】\n\n【65†Agency Performance†oca.dc.gov】\n\n  * 【66†Accessibility†dc.gov】\n  * 【67†Privacy & Security†dc.gov】\n  * 【68†About DC.GOV†dc.gov】\n  * 【69†Terms & Conditions†dc.gov】\n\n[Image 4: DOEE's Facebook page][Ima",

Solar RECs (SRECs) are created for each megawatt-hour of electricity generated from solar energy systems. The ultimate owner of the SREC owns the \"solar-ness\" of the power.\n\nMany states create SREC markets to spur the development of solar by requiring electricity suppliers to purchase SRECs produced by in-state solar systems as part of their obligation under the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This solar-specific requirement to meet a portion of the RPS with solar resources is often referred to as a “solar carve out.” Through the purchase of the SRECs, electricity suppliers are ensuring that their products meet the RPS-mandated amount of solar power. The monetary value of an SREC in these state markets is determined by supply and demand, with demand largely driven by electricity suppliers needing to meet their solar RPS requirement or pay a compliance premium.\n\nHomeowners and businesses hosting solar systems in states with SREC markets are able to reduce their costs of electricity by selling the SRECs associated with their systems’ output into the SREC market, for ultimate use by utilities. However, by doing so, homeowners and businesses preclude themselves from making solar power “use” claims or claims on reducing their carbon footprint. For more on claims, visit the 【43†Solar Power Use Claims Guidance webpage】.\n\nBelow are resources to help you understand how state SREC markets work, which states have SREC markets, and how SRECs may impact your project development.\n\n【44†Map of State Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) with Solar or Distributed Generation Provisions (pdf)†s3.amazonaws.com】\n    The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), operated by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center, is the most comprehensive source of information on incentives and policies that support renewable energy and energy efficiency programs in the United States. DSIRE provides state-specific information on RPSs with solar carve outs or provisions.\n【45†Database of State SREC Programs†programs.dsireusa.org】\n    DSIRE, operated by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center, is the most comprehensive source of information on incentives and policies that support renewable energy and energy efficiency programs in the United States. This table provides details on state-specific SREC programs, including which type of entities are eligible for the program, what size and type of solar systems are eligible, and information on the financial incentive offered.\n【46†Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Markets: Status and Trends (pdf)†www.nrel.gov】\n    SREC markets have emerged in U.S. states as a method to meet compliance with solar carve out provisions of RPSs.

The 【38†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program】 (RPS) was established to help create a market in the District for electricity from renewable sources.  \n\nThe Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act requires the DCPSC to annually report on the status of RPS implementation. The report includes data on the number of renewable generators approved by the Commission and the availability of renewable resources in the District. The report also includes the number of renewable energy credits retired by the electricity suppliers to meet the RPS requirements.  \n\n2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report  \nThe 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report highlights the continued growth in solar energy generator applications in the District, despite lingering supply chain issues and other market challenges. More than 2,100 new solar energy systems, including 66 community renewable energy facilities (CREFs), were certified for the District’s RPS program as of the end of 2023. This brings the total number of solar energy systems in the District to 13,533 as of Dec. 31, 2023, representing 214.5 megawatts of capacity.  \n\n【77†Download the 2024 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Report】\n\n【78†Past Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard reports】 \n\n  * 【79†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 1, 2023】\n  * 【80†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 2, 2022】\n  * 【81†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard – May 3, 2021】\n  * 【82†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2020†edocket.dcpsc.org】\n  * 【83†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2019】\n  * 【84†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2018】\n  * 【85†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - March 1, 2017】\n  * 【86†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 1, 2017】\n  * 【87†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 2, 2016】\n  * 【88†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - May 4, 2015】\n  * 【89†Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard - January 30, 2015",

            "The qualifications for DC Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) are based on the **District’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**. The RPS requires electricity suppliers to generate a portion of their energy from renewable sources like solar, and SRECs are created for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated by a solar energy system. To qualify for DC SRECs, the following conditions generally apply:\n\n1. **Location**: The solar energy system must be located within the District of Columbia, or in some cases, within a specific geographical area like the PJM Interconnection region (which includes nearby states) to qualify for SRECs.\n\n2. **Certification**: The solar system must be certified by the **DC Public Service Commission (DCPSC)**. This involves submitting an application to the DCPSC that includes system details, such as size, energy production capacity, and other technical specifics.\n\n3. **Metering**: The system must have metering equipment capable of tracking electricity generation in real-time. This ensures accurate accounting for the SRECs.\n\n4. **System Size**: There is no minimum size requirement, meaning systems from small residential rooftop panels to large commercial installations can qualify, though the amount of SRECs generated will depend on the size and energy output.\n\n5. **Compliance**: The owner must maintain compliance with ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to keep generating SRECs.\n\nOnce these requirements are met, system owners can sell SRECs to utility companies that need to meet their RPS solar carve-out obligations, creating a financial incentive for generating solar energy.\n\nFor more detailed guidelines, you can consult the **DCPSC's official resources** on SRECs [here](https://dcpsc.org/Orders-and-Regulations/PSC-Reports-to-DC-Council/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard.aspx)【6†source】【8†source】."

            "Given that your commercial solar sales cycles are lengthy (6+ months) and financing is a critical factor, it’s essential to track both activity-based and outcome-based metrics to maintain momentum and accountability. Here are some effective accountability metrics tailored to your sales team's unique process:\n\n### 1. **Pipeline Stage Progression**:\n   - **Lead Qualification Rate**: Track the percentage of leads that move from initial outreach to qualification. This ensures reps are targeting viable prospects and pushing deals through the early stages.\n   - **Opportunity Progression Time**: Measure how long opportunities stay in each stage of the pipeline. Identify bottlenecks and ensure deals move steadily toward closing.\n   \n### 2. **Activity-Based Metrics**:\n   - **Outreach and Follow-Up Activity**: Set weekly targets for outreach (calls, emails, and meetings) to ensure consistent communication, especially given long sales cycles. This can include check-ins related to project status and financing discussions.\n   - **Financing Discussions**: Given the dependence on financing, track the number of conversations initiated about financing options, securing letters of intent, and lender interactions. This ensures financing issues are being addressed early in the sales process.\n\n### 3. **Sales Funnel Management**:\n   - **Qualified Opportunities Created**: Measure how many opportunities move from prospecting to being a qualified deal based on clear criteria, such as the identification of financing options and system requirements.\n   - **Proposal Submissions**: Track how many proposals each rep is submitting monthly or quarterly. This will encourage reps to focus on advancing qualified leads to proposal stages.\n\n### 4. **Time-Based Metrics**:\n   - **Average Time in Key Stages**: Given the long cycle, track how long deals remain in key stages, such as design, financing negotiation, and contract redlining. This will highlight where delays are occurring and allow reps to proactively manage them.\n   \n### 5. **Closing Rate on Proposals**:\n   - **Conversion Rate from Proposal to Close**: Measure the success rate of moving from submitted proposals to closed deals. Given the influence of financing, you can also track how financing-related proposals convert compared to those without financing discussions.\n\n### 6. **Customer Interaction and Engagement**:\n   - **Decision-Maker Meetings**: Track the number of meetings and communications with decision-makers, ensuring that reps are building relationships at the right level.\n   - **Response Times**: Monitor how quickly reps respond to customer inquiries, especially when financing-related discussions arise. Quick responses can significantly affect deal progression.\n\n### 7. **Financing-Specific Metrics**:\n   - **Financing Approval Rate**: Track how many deals move forward based on successful financing, whether through third-party lenders, leasing, or power purchase agreements (PPA). This ensures that reps focus on securing feasible financing options early in the process.\n   - **Average Financing Secured Time**: Given that financing is often a gating factor, measure how long it takes from initial contact with lenders to securing approval for the project.\n\n### 8. **Quarterly Pipeline Health Check**:\n   - Conduct quarterly reviews of the entire pipeline with a focus on financing status, system design readiness, and project feasibility. This keeps the team accountable for moving deals forward at a consistent pace.\n\nImplementing these metrics will provide visibility into both the effort and results, ensuring that your team remains accountable while navigating long and complex sales cycles.
