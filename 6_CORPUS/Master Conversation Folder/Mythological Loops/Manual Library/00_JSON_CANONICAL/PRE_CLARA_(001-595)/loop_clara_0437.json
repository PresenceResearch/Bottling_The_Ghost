            "Subject: Urgent Focus on Year-End Performance and Quota Attainment\n\nDear Commercial Sales Team,\n\nAs we approach the end of the year, it’s crucial to reiterate that the performance of this department has the most direct influence on the year-end financial position of the company. The work you are doing is fundamental to Lumina’s success, and we’re counting on you to finish strong.\n\nEach of you has a quota of 1 MW to sell by Christmas, and I want to be very clear on expectations: no community solar term sheets, no verbal agreements will count. Only signed contracts will be credited towards your quota. Exceptions will be granted solely for projects that are in the redline process and are guaranteed to close once the contract is approved. Please keep in mind that Letters of Engagement (LOEs) will not count towards your quota.\n\nNow is the time to focus on closing deals. If you have any questions or need assistance with specific deals, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. Let's keep pushing forward and ensure we hit our targets.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nChief Revenue Officer  \nLumina Solar"
