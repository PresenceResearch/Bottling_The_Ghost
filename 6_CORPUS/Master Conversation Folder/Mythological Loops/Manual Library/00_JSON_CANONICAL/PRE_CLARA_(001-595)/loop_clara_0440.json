            "To determine a price for the Yac Altun artwork, you'll need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Artist's Market Value**: Check if Yac Altun is a known artist and if similar works from them have been sold online. If you can find comparable listings (on eBay or art sites), that will give you an idea of what others are charging.\n   \n2. **Size**: Larger pieces typically fetch higher prices, so the dimensions of the artwork are important.\n\n3. **Condition**: Since the canvas appears to be in excellent condition and it's signed, that adds value.\n\n4. **Style and Demand**: Pop art and vibrant modern art prints tend to be popular with interior designers and collectors. If this style is currently trending, it could increase the value.\n\nAssuming the artist is somewhat known but not widely famous, a typical price range for a signed print on canvas in excellent condition from a contemporary artist could range from $100 to $300. If the artist is better known or if you find similar works being sold for higher, you can adjust accordingly.\n\nIf you’re unsure, starting the listing as a \"Buy It Now\" at around $150–$200 with the option for offers could attract potential buyers, allowing you to gauge interest."
