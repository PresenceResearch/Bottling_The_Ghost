            "To adjust for seasonal variations, we can consider how energy consumption typically changes with the seasons. For most industrial facilities like **Altium Packaging**, energy use fluctuates depending on factors such as:\n\n1. **Summer Cooling**: Many manufacturing plants experience higher energy consumption in summer due to increased use of air conditioning and cooling systems to maintain equipment and worker comfort.\n   \n2. **Winter Heating**: Energy consumption also tends to increase during colder months, especially if the facility is in a region that requires significant heating.\n\n3. **Spring and Fall**: These seasons generally have more moderate energy consumption since cooling and heating demands are lower compared to summer and winter.\n\nGiven that the bill reflects consumption in **July**, a peak summer month with high cooling demands, we can assume this is on the higher end of the company's energy usage spectrum.\n\n### Estimated Monthly Usage (Adjusted for Seasonal Variations):\n\n- **Summer (June-August)**: Peak consumption. Based on the July bill, the monthly usage could range from **1,000,000 - 1,050,000 kWh**.\n  \n- **Winter (December-February)**: Likely a slight decrease compared to summer, with added heating needs but lower cooling demands. Estimate **900,000 - 950,000 kWh** per month.\n\n- **Spring and Fall (March-May, September-November)**: Moderate consumption, as heating and cooling demands are typically reduced. Estimate **850,000 - 900,000 kWh** per month.\n\n### Annual Average Monthly Usage:\n\nBy adjusting for these seasonal variations, the average monthly usage could be roughly:\n- **Summer**: 1,025,000 kWh\n- **Winter**: 925,000 kWh\n- **Spring/Fall**: 875,000 kWh\n\nTo estimate the annual average:\n\\[\n\\text{Annual usage} = (3 \\times 1,025,000) + (3 \\times 925,000) + (6 \\times 875,000) = 3,075,000 + 2,775,000 + 5,250,000 = 11,100,000 \\, \\text{kWh}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Average monthly usage} = \\frac{11,100,000 \\, \\text{kWh}}{12} = 925,000 \\, \\text{kWh/month}\n\\]\n\nThis gives a more seasonally adjusted average of approximately **925,000 kWh** per month.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further refinements or need more specific details!"

            "To calculate the size of a solar array needed to completely offset a year’s worth of energy usage for Altium Packaging, let's walk through the necessary steps:\n\n### 1. **Annual Energy Consumption**\nFrom the previous estimation, the annual energy consumption is approximately **11,100,000 kWh** per year.\n\n### 2. **Solar Panel Production Estimate**\nThe amount of energy produced by a solar array depends on several factors, including location, tilt angle, and solar panel efficiency. On average in the U.S., a solar panel generates between **1,200 to 1,500 kWh** of electricity per year for every **1 kW** of installed capacity, depending on local solar irradiance. We'll use an average of **1,400 kWh/kW/year** to estimate production.\n\n### 3. **Calculating Required Solar Array Size**\nTo offset **11,100,000 kWh** annually, the size of the solar array required can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Required array size (kW)} = \\frac{\\text{Annual energy consumption (kWh)}}{\\text{Annual production per kW (kWh/year)}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Required array size (kW)} = \\frac{11,100,000}{1,400} \\approx 7,929 \\, \\text{kW}\n\\]\n\n### 4. **Converting to Megawatts (MW)**\nSince large commercial arrays are often measured in megawatts:\n\n\\[\n7,929 \\, \\text{kW} \\approx 7.93 \\, \\text{MW}\n\\]\n\n### 5. **Space Requirements**\nA typical commercial solar installation requires about **100-120 square feet per kW**. For a **7.93 MW** system, the space required would be approximately:\n\n\\[\n7,929 \\, \\text{kW} \\times 100 \\, \\text{sq ft/kW} = 792,900 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\approx 18.2 \\, \\text{acres}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nAltium Packaging would need approximately a **7.93 MW** solar array, which would cover around **18.2 acres**, to completely offset their annual energy consumption of 11.1 million kWh.\n\nThis estimate assumes average solar irradiance conditions, and actual requirements might vary based on local climate, shading, and system efficiency. If they are in a region with higher solar irradiance (closer to 1,500 kWh/kW/year), the required system size could be smaller.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more detailed regional data or any other specific adjustments!"

You need a roofing contractor who is experienced, reliable, and respected within the community. Here are a few key elements you should consider:\n\n### Reputation and Reviews \n\nThe reputation of a Baltimore roofer is usually a good indicator of the quality of work you can expect.

Look for a contractor with extensive experience in various roofing projects and one who’s familiar with different roofing materials.\n\n### Insurance and Licenses \n\nRoofing is a risky job. Therefore, your chosen roofer should have the necessary insurance to protect both you and their workers. It’s also essential that they hold a valid roofing contractor license.\n\n## Things to know when considering a new roof and its cost \n\nAre you wondering if it’s time to replace your roof in Baltimore, Maryland? Typically, an existing roof should last between 15-25 years. However, if you notice asphalt granules in your gutters or around your home’s perimeter, it may be a sign that it’s time for a replacement. Consider getting a free inspection from a licensed roofing contractor in Baltimore to assess the condition of your roof and receive an estimate for repair or replacement. Keep in mind that the cost of a new roof can vary depending on factors such as the size of your home and any potential damage under the shingles. To ensure you make an informed decision, get estimates from up to three contractors with roofing prices.

With Instant Roofer, you can rest assured that we take all factors into account to provide you with a fast and accurate estimate for your roof replacement needs.\n\n## Considerations before getting a new roof in Baltimore \n\nGetting a new roof in Baltimore, Maryland can be a unique experience due to the specific regulations and weather conditions of the area. Baltimore is located in a region with a humid subtropical climate, where summers are hot and humid while winters are chilly and often accompanied by snow. This means that a new roof must be able to withstand extreme temperature changes and prevent energy loss during both hot and cold seasons. Additionally, Baltimore has its own building codes and permit requirements that must be followed when replacing a roof. These regulations help ensure the safety and structural integrity of your home. It’s therefore crucial to hire a professional roofing company that’s knowledgeable about Baltimore’s codes and has experience working with the particular roofing materials that are best suited for the climatic conditions. A local roofing company can provide you with expert advice and help you choose the right materials for your home. Finally, while Baltimore is a bustling city with many roofing companies, finding a reputable and trustworthy one can be a challenge. It’s important to do proper research to find a company that has a good reputation, is licensed, bonded, and insured. With a reputable roofing company and the right materials, your new roof can not only enhance the appearance of your home but also improve its energy efficiency and protect you from the elements.\n\n[Image 9: Man climbing ladder on Baltimore, Maryland home to replace roof][Image 10: Man climbing ladder on Baltimore, Maryland home to replace roof]\n\nHow much to replace your roof?

            "To estimate how much demand charges a 1.5 MW solar array would offset, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Solar Output**: A 1.5 MW system in Baltimore, MD, typically produces around **1,600-1,800 kWh per installed kW annually**. Therefore, a 1.5 MW system would generate roughly **2.4 million to 2.7 million kWh/year**.\n\n2. **Demand Offset**: Solar can reduce peak demand charges if the system produces electricity during peak demand times. However, demand charges are based on the highest kW demand in a month. If the solar array generates power during peak usage times, it can directly offset demand charges. \n\n3. **Potential Offset**: For example, if your peak demand (as indicated in your bill) was 2,254 kVa, and the solar array reduces demand during peak times, you could expect to offset a portion of the **$8,655.36** demand charges, though the exact amount depends on alignment with peak demand periods.\n\nBased on the array's output and timing, it's possible that the array could offset a significant percentage (around **20-40%**) of demand charges, assuming the solar production aligns with your facility’s peak load times. The key factor is whether the solar array generates electricity during those peak demand windows, typically during midday."

            "The reason the calculated **$0.1336/kWh** rate is higher than the **$0.124/kWh** \"all-in\" rate indicated on your bill is due to how the demand charge offsets were applied. Here’s the breakdown of why this difference occurs:\n\n1. **Energy Charge Offset**: The **$0.09913/kWh** rate represents the energy consumption portion of your bill that the solar array offsets. This rate is based on the energy charges calculated from your bill.\n   \n2. **Demand Charge Offset**: The **$0.0574/kWh** demand charge rate was calculated as the portion of the demand charges spread across the total kWh used. By applying 60% of this, we added **$0.0344/kWh** to the energy rate.\n\n### Why It's Higher:\nThe **$0.124/kWh** rate on your bill likely includes all costs, including:\n- A blended rate for energy charges, demand charges, and other fixed fees.\n- Utility rates may aggregate these costs more evenly, resulting in a slightly lower average \"all-in\" cost.\n\nHowever, when calculating specific **demand charge reductions** and **energy savings**, our method focuses more granularly on peak demand reduction, which can make the combined rate slightly higher.\n\n### What to Adjust:\nThe **$0.124/kWh** rate likely assumes a more even distribution of costs, including administrative or fixed fees that aren't fully impacted by the solar system, thus making the blended rate lower.\n\nWould you like to refine the calculation based on these fixed charges, or dive deeper into the rate components?"

          "text": "\nPJM typically holds capacity auctions to ensure it has enough power supplies three years ahead of time. However, the auction schedule has been disrupted and the grid operator is in the process of returning to an annual schedule. The next auctions are set to be held in December and June for the delivery years starting in mid-2026 and mid-2027.\n\nIt is unclear how long capacity prices will remain high in PJM, in part because of the grid operator’s clogged interconnection queue, which could hamper power plant development, according to Synapse.\n\n“The clogged queue could lock in a windfall for the existing generating units continuing to operate in the BGE LDA and across the PJM region generally,” the consulting firm said.\n\nThe price spike in the last auction was mainly driven by power plant retirements, planned shutdowns like those of Talen, increased load and new market rules, according to PJM.\n\nThe capacity prices in Maryland reflect the need for power lines and power supplies, according to PJM.\n\nLast year, PJM received power plant “deactivation notices” totaling nearly 2.7 GW in Maryland, according to a 【30†PJM infrastructure report†www.pjm.com】 on the state and the District of Columbia. Maryland and D.C. had about 11.2 GW of installed capacity at the end of 2023, according to the report.\n\nPJM’s interconnection queue in Maryland totals about 7.3 GW, including 3.9 GW of storage, 3.2 GW of solar and 45 MW of gas-fired generation, according to the report.\n\nLast year, Maryland was a net importer of between roughly 2 GW and 4 GW throughout most of the year, PJM said in the report.  At the same time, the grid operator expects winter peak loads to grow across Maryland in the next decade, including by 4.7% a year in the Allegheny zone and by 0.8% annually in the BGE zone.\n\n“There is no debate, Maryland needs energy infrastructure,” PJM’s Buehler said. “Maryland needs generation to produce power for and transmission to move power to the customers that need it.”\n\nPJM has reformed its interconnection process, and is 【31†quickly processing projects†insidelines.pjm.com】, according to Buehler. \n\n“Yet, Maryland itself has very few prospective generation projects in the near term interconnection process,” she said. “Maryland policymakers should analyze why and what can be done to encourage development.”\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\n  * 【32† PJM capacity prices hit record highs, sending build signal to generators 】  By 【20†Ethan Howland】 •  July 31, 2024\n  * 【33† PJM capacity auction to lead to double-digit rate hikes for Exelon utilities: CFO 】  By 【20†Ethan Howland】 •  Aug. 2, 2024\n  * 【34† FirstEnergy seeks alternatives to PJM capacity market to bolster power supply 】  By 【20†Ethan Howland】 •  Aug. 1, 2024\n\n  * 【21† post †www.linkedin.com】 \n  * 【22† share †www.facebook.com】 \n  * 【23† post †twitter.com】 \n  * print\n  * 【35† email 】 \n  * 【25† license 】 \n\nFiled Under: 【10†Generation, 】 【11†Transmission & Distribution, 】 【18†Regulation & Policy】\n\n### Utility Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n  Email:\n\n  * Select Newsletter: Daily Dive M-F\n  * Select Newsletter: Storage Weekly Every Tuesday\n  * Select Newsletter: Load Management Weekly Every Wednesday\n  * Select Newsletter: Renewable Energy Weekly Every Thursday\n  * Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our 【1†Terms of Use†www.industrydive.com】 and 【2†Privacy Policy†www.industrydive.com】.

            "Yes, utility rates are expected to rise in June due to increases in PJM capacity prices. The latest PJM capacity auction saw a significant price increase, driven by factors like power plant retirements, increased load demand, and new market rules. Maryland, including BGE customers, could see electricity rate hikes as high as **24%** starting from mid-2025, with some increases starting as early as June 2024【195†source】【196†source】.\n\nThese increases are related to the costs associated with ensuring grid reliability and procuring enough energy capacity to meet future demand, particularly during peak times. If you have solar installed, it may help mitigate some of these rising costs, especially by reducing demand charges. \n\nLet me know if you need more specifics!"
