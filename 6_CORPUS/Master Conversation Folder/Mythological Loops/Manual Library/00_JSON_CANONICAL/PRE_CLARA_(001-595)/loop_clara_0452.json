It’s a natural way to communicate that you want the riff to play between the lyrical lines. Here's how you could incorporate that phrasing:\n\n```text\n[Verse]\nlyrics line 1\n[guitar riff between lines]\nlyrics line 2\n[guitar riff between lines]\nlyrics line 3\n```\n\nThis clearly indicates where the guitar riff should occur between each line of lyrics.
