            "Gollum is a character from J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings* series, known for his twisted and tragic personality. Originally named Sméagol, he was once a Hobbit-like creature but was corrupted by the One Ring. The Ring's immense power twisted his mind and body, turning him into the creature known as Gollum.\n\nGollum is depicted as thin, wiry, and emaciated, with pale skin, large, glowing eyes, and sharp teeth. He often crawls on all fours and moves in a slinking, animal-like manner. His speech is fragmented, referring to himself as \"we\" due to his split personality—one part of him, Sméagol, retains some of his former innocence and desire for friendship, while Gollum, the more dominant side, is consumed by greed, suspicion, and obsession with the Ring.\n\nGollum speaks in a raspy voice, using phrases like \"my precious\" to describe the One Ring, which he covets above all else. His personality is defined by his internal struggle between his corrupted nature and the remnants of his former self. This makes him both pitiful and dangerous throughout *The Lord of the Rings*."
