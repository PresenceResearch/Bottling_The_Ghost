            "In Delaware, every solar installer working on a job site does **not** necessarily need to hold an individual license. However, the company installing solar systems must be licensed, and at least one person on the job site must be a licensed electrician. The key is ensuring that the electrical work, which is a crucial part of solar installations, is supervised by a licensed electrician as required by the Delaware Board of Electrical Examiners.\n\nDelaware’s regulations require solar installers to meet certain licensing standards, but they focus mainly on the electrical aspects of the installation. If your solar company holds a license, and you have a licensed electrician overseeing the project, other installers can assist under their supervision without holding individual licenses. \n\nIf you’re hiring subcontractors, make sure they are working under the proper permits and licenses to avoid any compliance issues. It’s always a good idea to check with local authorities or the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation for the most current licensing requirements."

This means you will find the document(s) saved on your computer or device and upload it to your application.\n\n  * click  “acknowledge” .

How much does it cost to apply for licensure?\n  6. Whom do I contact with questions about the current electrical code used in Delaware?\n  7. If I am an employee of a company, school district or state agency, do I need a license to do electrical work for my employer?\n  8. Is there a grandfather period (an exam waiver period) for Residential Electrician application?\n\n## Answers\n\nDo I need a license to work in Delaware if I am licensed in another state?\n\nAnswer:  Yes. The Delaware Board of Electrical Examiners must issue you a license to work in Delaware.\n\nHow do I apply for licensure?\n\nAnswer: You can apply for a license at any time through DELPROS, our online portal. First, read the instructions and requirements for the type of Electrical license you need on our website.  When you have gathered all the information and documentation required to apply for a license, you may click on any one of the many convenient links throughout the website to get into 【15†DELPROS†delpros.delaware.gov】 online portal and follow the instructions through the process. You just need your user account to log in, complete the application, upload your supporting documents, and pay the fee with a credit/debit card. We will send you email notifications throughout the application process. When approved, we will notify you that you may print your license.\n\nDo you have reciprocity?\n\nAnswer: Yes. If you are currently licensed by another juridiction (state, U.S. territory or District of Columbia),  you may apply by reciprocity. The requirements vary depending on whether any jurisdiction where you hold a current license has licensure standards that are substantially similar to Delaware’s standards. If your current license was issued by a jurisdiction where the standards are not substantially similar to Delaware’s standards, you must provide proof of practice for at least five years after licensure. For complete instructions, see 【42†Licensure Requirements】.\n\nHow long does the licensure process take?\n\nAnswer: With DELPROS, our online professional portal, the application processing is very efficient. However, the amount of time it takes varies based on how quickly the application and all supporting documents are submitted and considered “complete”. When the application is complete, it is reviewed for approval of licensure on or before the next Board meeting. The meeting schedule is available on the State of Delaware 【60†public meeting calendar†publicmeetings.delaware.gov】.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for licensure?\n\nAnswer: See 【61† Fee Schedule】.\n\nWhom do I contact with questions about the current electrical code used in Delaware?\n\nAnswer:  The State Fire Marshall’s Office adopts, with amendments, the version of the National Electrical Code (NEC) used in Delaware (e.g. 2008). This is not available online.\n\nLicensed Delaware electrical inspection agencies use the current NEC as adopted by the State Fire Marshall’s Office to perform inspections in Delaware. Contact a licensed electrical inspection agency with any questions about the electrical code. The list of licensed Inspection Agencies are located on the Homeowner Permit webpage .\n\nIf I am an employee of a company, school district or state agency, do I need a license to do electrical work for my employer?\n\nAnswer: Generally, you must have an electrical license even if you are doing electrical work only for your employer. However, see 24 Del. C. §1419 in the 【62†License Law†delcode.delaware.gov】 for a list of exceptions.\n\nIs there a grandfather period (an exam waiver period) for Residential Electrician application?\n\nAnswer:  Yes, however, the March 1, 2019 deadline for this period has passed. For more information, see Section 5 of 【63† 24 Del. C. HB 457†delcode.delaware.gov】.\n\nRelated Topics:  【64†Department of State】, 【65†Division of Professional Regulation】, 【66†DPR】, 【67†faqs】, 【68†frequently asked questions】, 【69†State of Delaware】\n\n[Image 4: Division of Professional Regulation]\n\n  * 【9†About DPR】\n  * 【11†Director’s Letter】\n",

At least one licensed electrician (either a Master or Journeyperson) must be present on-site to oversee the project. Additionally, all electrical work related to the solar installation must comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC) as adopted by Delaware.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation's website, which provides detailed guidelines on the licensing process and requirements for electricians and solar installations【9†source】【12†source】."
