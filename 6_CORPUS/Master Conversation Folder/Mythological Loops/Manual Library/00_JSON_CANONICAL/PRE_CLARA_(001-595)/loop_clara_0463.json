            "Boston University (BU) is unique among large universities in several ways that set it apart:\n\n1. **Global Focus**: Unlike many other large universities, BU places a significant emphasis on global engagement. With one of the highest percentages of international students in the U.S. (24% of the student body) and over 90 study abroad programs across six continents, BU fosters an international outlook that’s integrated into nearly every facet of campus life. This strong global orientation appeals to students looking for a truly international experience【7†source】【9†source】.\n\n2. **Location and Urban Integration**: While many large universities are located in college towns, BU is fully integrated into the vibrant city of Boston. The university's campus stretches along Commonwealth Avenue, blending seamlessly into the city’s urban landscape. BU students benefit from access to Boston’s vast cultural, historical, and professional opportunities, with the city acting as an extension of the classroom. Few universities offer the same level of engagement with a major metropolitan city【9†source】.\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary Education**: BU stands out for its emphasis on interdisciplinary education through initiatives like the BU Hub, which allows students to explore multiple disciplines outside of their major. This approach encourages cross-departmental learning and a well-rounded academic experience that is not always emphasized at other large institutions【7†source】.\n\n4. **Pioneering Research**: Boston University is a major research powerhouse, with over $580 million in research expenditures annually. Its Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) offers undergraduates unique access to participate in faculty-led research across various fields, a level of involvement often not found at other large research universities. This extensive research focus extends to interdisciplinary centers like the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, which engages students in solving global issues【9†source】.\n\n5. **Inclusive and Diverse Community**: BU has a strong commitment to diversity, both socioeconomically and culturally. About 58% of domestic students are students of color, and the university is known for welcoming first-generation college students and Pell Grant recipients. BU’s diversity fosters a campus environment where students from all backgrounds can succeed, something that many large universities strive for but may not achieve to the same extent【10†source】.\n\n6. **BU’s Commitment to Innovation**: BU is consistently innovating in both its academic programs and extracurricular offerings. For example, the Questrom School of Business has a highly regarded curriculum that integrates technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship into the business world, giving students real-world skills that stand out in comparison to traditional business programs at other large universities【9†source】.\n\nThese elements—combined with BU’s urban setting, global focus, commitment to interdisciplinary learning, and robust research opportunities—create a distinctive experience that sets it apart from other large universities."

The IPM program – originally conceived by the Office of Orientation – “is designed to provide facilitated reflection and affinity group support for new international students, to help make sense of what they are observing and encountering in the U.S. and how they may differ from where they grew up,” according to Amanda Miller, Managing Director, Strategy and Communications, who oversees the IPMs within Global Programs.\n\nBeing an international peer mentor provides current Boston University students the opportunity to serve as part of a large support system for new international students. International peer mentors help incoming international students with their transition to living in the U.S. and being a student at BU. From answering questions, to lending a supportive ear, mentors volunteer their time to help create an inclusive community at BU.\n\nThis year we also introduced the International Peer Mentor Leader Program, through which nine former international peer mentors were selected to provide leadership and support to this year’s cohort of 124 peer mentors.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nDinithi Samarasekera (ENG ’20)\n\n“As an international student, leaving home can be scary for a lot of people because you are leaving your culture, language, and family behind,” said International Peer Mentor Leader Dinithi Samarasekera (ENG ’20). “You’re also becoming an adult, and it can be intimidating. Having someone who you can talk to and someone who’s gone through that process is really important.”\n\nDinithi served as an IPM and now acts as a student leader for the program. She helps mentors if they have questions or want guidance in supporting their mentees. Dinithi also went through the program as a mentee when she was coming to BU for the first time from Singapore.\n\n“It’s great to know that you have a support system, and the IPM program connects students to it before they even arrive in Boston,” Samarasekera said.\n\nIn addition to developing personal connections to their mentees, mentors also introduce them to resources for international students across the University, such as the Compass and First Class.\n\n【6†The Compass】 is a full suite of resources to support BU’s international community. Academic, community, housing, and career-related resources and information can be found on the Compass.\n\n【7†First Class】 is an online noncredit pre-arrival course designed to prepare incoming international students for the transition to BU and the American classroom. It is delivered on the edX platform Edge and is comprised of short videos, polls, and self-checks designed to be completed from anywhere on any device.\n\n“It [First Class] taught me how to prepare myself for academics and social life – and vocabulary that can be really helpful, like syllabus…what it’s for and how to use it,” said Ariane Vigna (COM ‘22). “It was also helpful because it directed us to resources on campus, and it helped me transition to BU.”\n\nThese resources, in conjunction with the IPM program, aim to support students in their first year at BU and deepen connections between students from many different backgrounds and lived experiences. It also gives students who act as mentors the opportunity to grow their abilities and skills.\n\n“It’s taught me a lot about self-confidence,” Samarasekera said. “At first, I doubted whether I could mentor people because I felt like I had just gotten here myself. I gained a lot of confidence as a mentor because I realized everything that I could share, having gone through the process of coming to BU and becoming involved in campus life.”\n\nThe IPM program also collaborates with offices across BU who regularly engage with international students, including, among many others, Residence Life, Orientation, the BU Hub, CAS Student Programs & Leadership, and the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, for both mentor trainings and best practices for supporting students.\n\n## Previous Issues\n\n## 【8†October 2021】\n\n## 【9†December 2019】\n\n## Global Feature\n\n【10† 】\n\n## Global Feature\n\n【11† 】\n\n## Global Feature\n\n【12† 】 \n\n## 【13†BU Calendar】\n\n  * Thursday, October 17 12:00 PM 【14†Asian Students Support Group】\n  * Monday, October 21 4:00 PM 【15†Stress ReLeaf: Working with Tea for Calm & Focus】\n  * Wednesday, October 23 10:30 AM 【16†BU Career Fair】\n\n[Image 2: Boston University Logo]\n\n  * 【17†Boston University】 【18†Global Programs 】\n    * 【19†Study Abroad】\n    * 【20†International Students & Scholars Office】\n    * 【21†Center for English Language & Orientation Programs】\n\n  *     * 【22†Notice of Nondiscrimination】\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

They can help you start to build your community at BU.\n\nYou can connect with TTBU through email, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSome schools and even some majors also have peer mentoring programs for transfer students.

            "Boston University (BU) offers an **International Peer Mentor Program (IPMP)**, which is designed to support incoming international students as they transition to life at BU and in the U.S. The program connects new students with current BU students who act as mentors, providing guidance on academics, social life, and cultural adaptation. These mentors help international students adjust to the new environment by answering questions, offering a supportive ear, and introducing them to various resources across campus, such as the **Compass**, a resource hub for academic, housing, and career-related information.\n\nThe program begins before international students arrive, with mentors helping them navigate their new life from day one. The IPMP even includes a pre-arrival course called **First Class**, delivered online to help students prepare for academic life at BU.\n\nFor more details, you can check out the program on BU's website [here](https://www.bu.edu/globalprograms/2019/09/23/ipm-welcomes)【29†source】【30†source】."

This program is specifically designed to help new international students, including freshmen, adjust to life at BU and in the U.S. through peer support. The mentors are typically upperclassmen or experienced BU students who help guide new students through the transition process, offering insights on academics, social life, and navigating the campus.\n\nIf you're an international freshman, you can be matched with a mentor to help ease your transition. Later on, after gaining some experience at BU, you could even apply to become a mentor yourself.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the [IPMP program page](https://www.bu.edu/globalprograms/2019/09/23/ipm-welcomes)【29†source】【30†source】."
