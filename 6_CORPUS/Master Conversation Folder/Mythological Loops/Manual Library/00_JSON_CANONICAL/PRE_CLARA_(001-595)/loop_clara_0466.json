            "Regulation **27 DE Reg. 885 (effective May 1, 2024)** refers to updates and clarifications to Delaware’s Board of Electrical Examiners rules. Specifically, it outlines various procedures related to electrical licensure, including updates on homeowners’ permits, inspection agency requirements, and duties of licensees. \n\nKey aspects of the regulation include:\n1. **Homeowners’ Permits**: Permits are required for new electrical construction or renovations in non-commercial settings. Homeowners performing their own electrical work must submit detailed plans for review by an approved inspection agency before receiving the permit.\n   \n2. **Inspection Agencies**: Agencies conducting electrical inspections must hold proper licensure and insurance, and they must ensure their inspections adhere to the National Electrical Code and local building codes.\n\n3. **Licensing and Insurance**: The regulation also emphasizes maintaining adequate liability insurance for electricians and sets forth experience requirements for license applicants.\n\nThese updates are intended to ensure electrical safety and proper oversight within Delaware, particularly in residential settings, and apply to all involved in electrical work, from homeowners to licensed electricians.\n\nFor full details, you can access the Delaware Register of Regulations directly."
