            "To run the cleaning cycle on an ice maker like the one in your image (model WBJ-10A), follow these general steps. However, it's always good to check the user manual for specific instructions:\n\n1. **Turn off the ice maker**: Before cleaning, make sure the ice maker is turned off and unplugged from the power outlet for safety.\n\n2. **Remove the ice**: Take out any ice that may be in the tray and dispose of it.\n\n3. **Prepare the cleaning solution**: Use a solution of warm water and mild detergent or a mixture of water and vinegar (one part vinegar to one part water) to clean the interior. Some manufacturers recommend using a specialized ice machine cleaner—check your user manual for any specific recommendations.\n\n4. **Run the cleaning cycle**: \n   - Turn on the machine and, if your ice maker has a “clean” button or mode, press it.\n   - Follow the machine's instructions. Typically, it will cycle water or a cleaning solution through the machine to clean out the internal parts.\n\n5. **Rinse**: After the cleaning cycle finishes, rinse the ice maker thoroughly with clean water to remove any detergent or cleaning solution residue.\n\n6. **Wipe the interior**: Use a soft cloth or sponge to wipe down the interior surfaces, making sure to get all corners and parts where ice forms or water passes through.\n\n7. **Restart the ice maker**: Plug the ice maker back in, turn it on, and let it make a few batches of ice before using it for consumption to ensure any cleaning solution has been fully flushed out.\n\nIf your machine doesn't have a specific cleaning button, you may have to manually clean and rinse it before running a few cycles to clean it out fully.\n\nLet me know if you need more specific details!"
