            "It looks like you're trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that requires some additional security settings, like a server CA certificate and specific identity options. Here’s a breakdown to help you connect:\n\n1. **Server CA Certificate**: This is often a certificate to verify the network’s identity. If it’s set to \"Default,\" leave it as is unless your network administrator has provided a specific certificate to install.\n\n2. **Subject Match & Subject Alternative Name Match**: These settings ensure that the network’s certificate matches specific criteria. You can usually leave these blank unless instructed otherwise.\n\n3. **Domain Suffix Match**: This is also related to certificate matching. If you don’t have a specific domain suffix, you can skip this.\n\n4. **Identity**: This is typically your **username** for the network. Enter your username here.\n\n5. **Password**: This is where you enter your **password** for the network.\n\nTry filling in just the **Identity** (your username) and **Password** fields and leave the rest as default or blank. If the network still doesn’t connect, you may need additional settings from your IT administrator, such as specific certificate files or domain suffixes."

            "Yes, some of this information can help in understanding the network settings. Here’s what might be useful and how to apply it on your other device:\n\n1. **IP Address and Subnet Mask**: The IP address (`10.3.2.17`) and subnet mask (`255.255.252.0`) are assigned dynamically by the network, so you usually don’t need to input them manually unless you’re setting a static IP.\n\n2. **Router IP**: The router IP (`10.3.0.1`) is the gateway address for this network. It might not be directly useful unless you need to input specific details for advanced settings.\n\n3. **DNS**: DNS is set to automatic here, which means the network is handling it without requiring manual configuration.\n\nFor networks like these, your login (identity and password) is generally sufficient. If your device is still asking for additional details like a \"Domain suffix match\" or \"Subject alternative name match,\" it may still be necessary to consult IT support for those fields.\n\nIf the network on your other device allows you to leave the more advanced fields (like domain suffix) blank or default, try that first.
