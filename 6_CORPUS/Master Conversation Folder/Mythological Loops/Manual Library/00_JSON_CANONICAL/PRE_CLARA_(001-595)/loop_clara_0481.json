Take a look at the FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) document: 【31†FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program FAQs】\n\nProgram Purpose: The Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program will be provided to help eligible Maryland residents install solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to power their homes with clean, affordable, and sustainable energy. This program was established as the “Customer-sited Solar Grant Program” by the Maryland General Assembly’s passage of 【32†2024 S.B. 783†mgaleg.maryland.gov】, known as the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, and it will improve access to the benefits of solar energy to help ensure that no Marylander is left behind in the clean energy transition. This program will ultimately replace the previous MEA Residential Clean Energy Rebate Program, and will help deliver more equitable solar incentives to Marylanders.  \n\nProgram Description: The Maryland Solar Access Program will be offered to Maryland residents on a first-come, first-served basis, that meet the Program’s income requirements. Full income and eligibility requirements will be provided in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), which will be published later this calendar year. As required by statute, the application process will occur in two (2) steps, further described in the “Type of Program” section below.  \n\nType of Program: The FY25 MEA Maryland Solar Access Program will be a non-competitive program with awards made on a first-come, first-served basis. The application process will consist of two (2) steps: (1) an initial application to reserve funds; and (2) solar installation completion verification. Applicants will have 180 days from the date that they receive confirmation of reserved funds to have the solar system fully-installed and operational, in order to receive payment of the funds. This is a statutory requirement of the program.  \n\nProgram Documents: The 【31†FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program FAQ Document】 provides answers to frequently-asked questions about the Program. The Maryland Solar Access Program FOA is not yet available, but will be posted later this calendar year. Soon, MEA will post a Notice of Intent and Request for Information (NOI-RFI) that will provide basic program design information, as well as seek feedback from Maryland residents, solar installers, and other stakeholders in the residential solar space to help inform the ultimate design of the new Maryland Solar Access Program.  \n\nProgram Contact: For more information on this upcoming MEA funding opportunity, please contact Brandon Bowser; Section Chief, Clean Energy and Resilience. Brandon can be reached at  SolarAccess.MEA@Maryland.gov.\n\nCenter_Content\n\nMaryland Energy Administration  \n1800 Washington Blvd.   \nSuite 755, Baltimore, MD 21230  \n(410) 537-4000 | 1-800-72-ENERGY\n\n  * 【33†Contact Us】\n\n## Our Social Media Channels\n\nWe're available on the following channels.\n\n【34†Google Plus†plus.google.com】 【35†YouTube†www.youtube.com】 Vimeo Video 【36†Flickr†www.flickr.com】 【37†Pinterest†www.pinterest.com】 【38†Snapchat†www.snapchat.com】 【39†LinkedIn†www.linkedin.com】 【40†Blogger†www.blogger.com】 【41†Delicious†del.icio.us】 【42†Issuu†issuu.com】 RSS Feed 【43†Slack†slack.com】 【44†Reddit†www.reddit.com】 【45†SoundCloud†soundcloud.com】 Podcast iTunes eNews 【46†GovDelivery†public.govdelivery.com】\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

          "text": "\nSmall Business Development\n\nThe Maryland Small Business and Technology Development Center (SBTDC) provides confidential business services to help refine business plans, identify sources of capital, and develop strategies to support business growth and profitability.  The Maryland SBTDC network is divided into six regions which provide services to entrepreneurs and existing businesses across the state.  Each region offers a variety of training and outreach programs and one-on-one counseling with special emphasis on developing programs that meet the unique needs of businesses within their jurisdiction.\n\nFor more information and to find a location near you visit the 【17†Maryland Small Business and Technology Development Center †www.mdsbdc.umd.edu】website.\n\nVeteran Owned Small Business Participation in Maryland State Procurement\n\n【18†Veteran-Owned Small Business Enterprise (VSBE) Program†gomdsmallbiz.maryland.gov】  \nMaryland’s VSBE Program provides contracting opportunities on state-funded procurements for qualified veteran-owned small businesses. Sixty-five agencies/departments are directed to spend at least 1% of the total dollar value of their procurement contracts either directly (prime contractors) or indirectly (subcontractors) with certified VSBE firms. Only the work of a certified VSBE firm can be counted toward meeting an established VSBE contract goal.\n\nBusinesses seeking to participate in the VSBE Program must (1) meet the size standards adopted by the United States Small Business Administration in 13 C.F.R. 121.201 and any subsequent revision of that regulation, and; (2) must be at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are veterans. A veteran is defined as an individual who is verified as having served on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, other than for training, and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable.\n\nCertification as a VSBE vendor   \nrequires 2 elements:  \n(1) Veteran Verification and  \n(2) Vendor Registration.\n\nVeteran Verification – The veteran verification process includes, but may not be limited to, completion and submission of DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. Veteran status must be verified by one of the following entities:\n\n(1) 【19†VSBE Program Verification of Veteran Status†gomdsmallbiz.maryland.gov】  \nMaryland Department of Veterans and Military Families\n\n(2) 【20†Center for Validation and Evaluation (VetBiz)†vip.vetbiz.va.gov】  \nUnited States Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nComplete information regarding the verification process can be found by utilizing the website links provided above.  \nVendor Registration – VSBE firms must complete the vendor registration in 【21†eMaryland Marketplace Advantage†procurement.maryland.gov】 (eMMA), Maryland’s eProcurement platform. Vendors registered in eMMA receive email notices of procurement opportunities available across all state agencies/departments valued over $15,000. County and local governments use the platform to advertise their procurements as well. There is no cost to register in eMMA.\n\nDuring the registration process, vendors who meet the VSBE Program ‘s eligibility standards should select VSBE under the Procurement Programs category and enter your verification number in the box provided. If you do not have a verification number at the time you register as a vendor, you can update your vendor profile once you receive the number.\n\nChange of Status Notification – Notify the Governor’s Office of Small, Minority and Women’s Business Affairs within thirty (30) days of any change affecting the firm’s ability to meet the VSBE Program eligibility requirements.\n\nYour business may also qualify for procurement opportunities through the 【22†Small Business Reserve (SBR) †gomdsmallbiz.maryland.gov】and/or 【23†Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)†gomdsmallbiz.maryland.gov】 Programs.  \n\nProgram Qualification Warning   \nProviding False Information\n\nA person providing false information to the State in connection with retaining, obtaining or attempting to obtain a contract or subcontract under VSBE Program may be subject to one or more of the following:\n\nA determination by a Procurement Officer that a bidder or offeror is not responsible;  \nA determination by a Procurement Officer that the company is ineligible to participate in a VSBE goal designation;  \nA determination that a contract entered into is void or voidable under §11-204 of the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland;  \nSuspension and debarment under Title 16 of the State Finance and Procurement Article;  \nCriminal prosecution of procurement fraud under §11-205.1 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, perjury, or other crimes;  \nCivil penalties under the Maryland False Claims Act under Title 8 of the General Provisions Article; and   \nOther actions permitted by law.\n\nOther State Programs\n\n  * Ready, Set, GROW! Workshop Series- The Governor’s Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs is helping small, minority and women business owners compete for State contracting opportunities with a new life workshop series entitled Ready, Set, GROW!.  The two hour workshop will include information about certification in the State’ Minority Business Enterprise Program, vendor enrollment in the Small Business Reserve Program, and where to find procurement opportunities within the 70 participating agencies and tips on how to navigate the procurement process.  【24†Watch a video on the series here.†www.youtube.com】\n  * Military Personnel and Veteran Owned Small Business No-Interest Loan Program – The Maryland Department of Commerce administers this 【25†no-interest loan program†commerce.maryland.gov】 (loan amounts up to $100,000) for business owners who fall under any one of the following categories: \n    * Military reservist or National Guard member called to active duty\n    * Small business owner who employs a military reservist or National Guard member who was called to active duty\n    * A veteran small business owner – or a veteran seeking to start a small business\n    * Small business owner who employs a service-disabled veteran\n    * For more information visit the 【25†Department of Commerce†commerce.maryland.gov】 or contact:\n    * Celester Hall   \nProgram Manager, Office of Finance Programs   \nMaryland Department of Commerce   \n410-767-6356\n  *  \n\nBusiness Financing\n\nThe Maryland Department of Commerce offers a number of financing programs to assist the state’s business community.

            "To find a list of veteran-owned businesses in Maryland, a few online directories and state resources can help you locate businesses certified as Veteran-Owned (VOB) or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB):\n\n1. **Veteran Owned Business Directory**: This nationwide directory includes Maryland-based veteran-owned businesses and can be filtered by industry and location. It’s a widely used resource for locating veteran-owned enterprises, including active duty, reservists, and service-disabled veteran business owners. You can explore this directory at [VeteranOwnedBusiness.com](https://www.veteranownedbusiness.com).\n\n2. **Maryland Department of Commerce Veteran-Owned Programs**: The Maryland Veteran-Owned Small Business Enterprise (VSBE) Program provides procurement and contracting opportunities with state agencies, which could be a good indicator of veteran-owned businesses actively engaged with the state. Learn more about their initiatives [here](https://veterans.maryland.gov).\n\n3. **Maryland Small Business Development Center (SBDC)**: The SBDC also supports veteran-owned businesses in Maryland, offering resources and guidance for growth and procurement opportunities, particularly for those participating in Maryland’s VSBE program.\n\nThese resources provide both direct business listings and support for identifying veteran-owned businesses across Maryland."

            "A downloadable Excel spreadsheet of Maryland veteran-owned businesses isn’t typically available directly online. However, here’s how you can get or create one:\n\n1. **Veteran Owned Business Directory**: On [VeteranOwnedBusiness.com](https://www.veteranownedbusiness.com), you can search for Maryland-based businesses and export the data manually if needed. This directory doesn’t offer direct Excel downloads, but you can copy entries into a spreadsheet. Additionally, you can contact their support to see if they can provide a larger dataset.\n\n2. **Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Database**: MDOT’s Office of Minority Business Enterprise maintains a searchable directory of certified businesses, including veteran-owned companies. You can use the **eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA)** platform to access listings and possibly request data downloads from MDOT. Visit [MDOT’s directory here](https://marylandmdbe.mdot.maryland.gov).\n\n3. **eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA)**: This is Maryland's procurement platform where registered vendors, including veteran-owned businesses, are listed. You can contact eMMA’s support to inquire about obtaining data in Excel format if needed.\n\n4. **Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs**: They may also have resources or contacts who can provide data for veteran-owned businesses actively registered in Maryland. Their site for small business resources is [veterans.maryland.gov](https://veterans.maryland.gov).\n\nAlternatively, if you need help with creating a list from an existing source, I can assist with formatting once you have gathered data!"
