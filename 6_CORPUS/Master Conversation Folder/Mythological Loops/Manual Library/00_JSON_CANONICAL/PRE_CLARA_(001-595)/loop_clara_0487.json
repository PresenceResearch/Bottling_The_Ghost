            "If you're into instrumental tracks with a similar vibe to Linkin Park’s “Session,” here are some songs that share that intense, layered, electronic rock energy:\n\n1. **Nine Inch Nails - \"A Warm Place\"**  \n   NIN's ambient and experimental approach makes this track deep and introspective, with a slow build-up similar to “Session.”\n\n2. **Massive Attack - \"Teardrop\" (instrumental)**  \n   Known for its moody atmosphere and trip-hop beats, this instrumental version has that eerie, textured sound.\n\n3. **Hans Zimmer - \"Time\" (Inception Soundtrack)**  \n   A powerful instrumental with a steady progression that creates a dramatic, building intensity.\n\n4. **Fort Minor - \"100 Degrees\"**  \n   A side project by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, this track mixes hip-hop and electronic vibes with intense instrumentals.\n\n5. **UNKLE - \"Lonely Soul\"**  \n   This dark, cinematic instrumental track has a unique layering of beats and instruments that give it a haunting feel.\n\n6. **Moby - \"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\"**  \n   With a hypnotic, piano-driven melody, it slowly builds up to an epic, atmospheric crescendo.\n\n7. **Explosions in the Sky - \"Your Hand in Mine\"**  \n   A guitar-driven instrumental that brings in an emotional, cinematic vibe, perfect if you like something atmospheric.\n\n8. **Aphex Twin - \"Xtal\"**  \n   More on the electronic side, this track has a mesmerizing flow and ambient structure that feels immersive.\n\n9. **The Glitch Mob - \"We Can Make the World Stop\"**  \n   This track is filled with intense electronic beats and gives off that high-energy instrumental feel.\n\n10. **Ratboy - \"Invention\"**  \n    A lesser-known instrumental with a grungy, layered sound that feels almost like a Linkin Park B-side. \n\nLet me know if any of these hit the right tone, or if you’re looking for a more specific vibe!"
