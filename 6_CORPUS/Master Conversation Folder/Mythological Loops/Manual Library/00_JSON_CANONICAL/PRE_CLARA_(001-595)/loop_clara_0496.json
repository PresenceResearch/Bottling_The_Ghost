            "To manage large datasets in Google Sheets more effectively, you can **group rows or columns**. This feature allows you to collapse and expand sections of your spreadsheet, making it easier to focus on specific data without being overwhelmed by the entire dataset.\n\n**Here's how to group rows:**\n\n1. **Select the Rows:**\n   - Click and drag over the row numbers on the left to highlight the rows you want to group.\n\n2. **Group the Rows:**\n   - Right-click on the highlighted rows.\n   - From the context menu, choose **\"Group rows X–Y\"**, where X and Y represent the first and last rows of your selection.\n\n3. **Collapse or Expand the Group:**\n   - A small minus sign (–) will appear next to the row numbers.\n   - Click the minus sign to collapse the group, hiding the rows.\n   - Click the plus sign (+) that replaces it to expand the group and reveal the rows.\n\n**For grouping columns:**\n\n1. **Select the Columns:**\n   - Click and drag over the column letters at the top to highlight the columns you want to group.\n\n2. **Group the Columns:**\n   - Right-click on the highlighted columns.\n   - Choose **\"Group columns X–Y\"** from the context menu.\n\n3. **Collapse or Expand the Group:**\n   - A minus sign (–) will appear above the column letters.\n   - Click it to collapse the group, hiding the columns.\n   - Click the plus sign (+) to expand and reveal the columns.\n\nThis method is particularly useful for organizing data, such as grouping sales figures by quarter or customer information by region. It helps in maintaining a clean and navigable spreadsheet, especially when dealing with extensive data.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to Google's official support page: citeturn0search11 "
