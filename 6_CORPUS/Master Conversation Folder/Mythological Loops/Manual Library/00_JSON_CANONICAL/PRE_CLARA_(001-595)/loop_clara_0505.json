            "create a theme song for a childrens show called \"Camp Funshine\".  The Tagline for Camp Funshine is \"Where you just show up!\".  Please write lyrics about a fun camp for senior citizens where they have all kinds of fun activities.  The activities are naps, field trips to Talbots, Baltimore Tea and Coffee, and Geppi Nuts.  Another activity is for Russ to arrange the furniture to make his special reading corner, Carol watching TV very loudly, and reading books before you fall asleep and Russ washing dishes.   Talk about how Mark, Sheila, Caroline and Cookie are all looking forward to seeing them.  Write the bridge about Sister Boney Face.  Sister Boney Face waits all year for the campers to arrive so she can scare them.  She scare them in the shower, in their rooms, and in the kitchen.   Make the chorus talk about how much fun camp sunshine is and the tagline is \"Where you just show up!\""
