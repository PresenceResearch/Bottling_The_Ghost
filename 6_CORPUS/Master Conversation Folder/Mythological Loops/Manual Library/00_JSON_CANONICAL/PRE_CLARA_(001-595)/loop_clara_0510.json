            "Write a song about the camp fun shine Saturday schedule for campers Carol and Russ. The first activity is breakfast. Breakfast is oatmeal with lots of weird things that Russ puts on it. The second activity is a field trip and a shopping trip. Campers will go to the Dutch market, Talbots, Baltimore, tea, and coffee, and Jeppi nuts. Campers will then have quiet time until dinner. After dinner campers will go to the big city to see the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra right about how the campers will have so much fun and drink lots of tea and decaffeinated coffee."
