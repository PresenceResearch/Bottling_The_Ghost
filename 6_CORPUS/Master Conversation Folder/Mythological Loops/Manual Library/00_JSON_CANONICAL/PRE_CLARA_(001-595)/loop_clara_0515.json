This \npresents a paradigm shift in the sustainability \nand carbon footprint of the global built \nenvironment.\n\nWith ClearVue, a building approaching net zero \nis within reach.\n\n\n\nWhy \nClearVue\n\nThe built environment must be included in any \nmeaningful solution to meet global net zero emission \naspirations. Representing some 40% of annual \nglobal CO2 emissions, the built environment requires \ninnovative solutions where energy can be generated \nto lessen the need to draw power from carbon \nproducing energy sources.  \n\nClearVue is building a bridge between the \nconstruction and renewable energy industries \nwith aesthetically pleasing solutions that support \nstructural integrity and safety, environmental \nresponsibility, and strong commercial payback.\n\n\n\nClearVuePV Façade\nClearVue’s Solar Façade maximizes on-site energy \ngeneration. Our solar products include a full \nline of Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPVs) \nthat complement and enhance a broad range of \narchitectural styles.\n\nClearVuePV Vision Glass\nTransparent glass building surfaces become \nenergy generating with our patented ClearVue \nVision Glass. It has significant advantages. It \nprovides transparency and delivers both energy \ngeneration and excellent thermal performance \nwhich provides an improved Solar Heat Gain \nCoefficient (SHGC) when deployed across a \nbuilding façade. Our Solar Vision Glass can be \ncustomized to work in most glass configurations \nproviding flexibility for building integration.\n\nClearVuePV Spandrel \nClearVuePV spandrel solutions deliver excellent \nreliability, efficiency, and performance for building \nsustainability.\n\nClearVuePV Cladding \nClearVue offers a broad range of PV Cladding \ncolors and patterns. Our silicon-based cladding \nhas the ability to generate significant power while \noffering a broad range of visual textures and \ncolors to achieve architectural intent.\n\nClearVuePV Skylight & Balustrade \nOur class-leading silicon balustrade, and skylight \nglass can be delivered in single laminated or \nInsulating Glass Units (IGUs).\n\n\n\nProvides significant \nenergy generation \n\nthrough the \nintegration of solar \n\nsolutions across \nbuilding surfaces.\n\nTypically, ClearVue \nsolutions can \n\ndeliver 50% or \nmore of the power \nrequirements for \n\nbuildings.\n\nA path to \nsustainable \n\nbuildings and often \nqualifies for tax \n\ncredit and incentive \nprograms.\n\nIncreased yield \nrate of return and \n\nleads to higher \nresale values on \n\nreal estate assets.\n\nSupports corporate \nsustainability \n\nprograms and ESG \ngoals and assists in \nkeeping pace with \n\nregulatory changes.\n\nClearVue provides a practical solution to meet \nenvironmental building policy requirements.\n\nDecreased building \noperational \ncosts with \n\nimproved thermal \nperformance.\n\nSolar Façade \nBenefits\n\nOperational \npayback through \nrenewable energy \n\ngeneration \nthat provides \n\nsubstantial carbon \nfootprint offset. \n\nCompatible with \nindustry standard \n\ncurtain wall/framing \nsystems and uses \nadvanced sealing \nsystem to prevent \nwater infiltration.\n\n\n\nSolar Vision \nGlass\n\nClearVuePV Vision Glass supports sustainable \n\nbuilding operations by providing energy \n\ngeneration that significantly offsets \n\noperational energy requirements.\n\nWhat were once Insulated Glass Units (IGUs) \n\nthat were an area of energy losses, can now \n\nbe a source of clean, renewable energy.\n\nNow it is possible to generate energy from \n\ntruly transparent glass building surfaces.\n\n\n\nSolar Vision Glass\nClearVuePV Vision Glass facilitates clean energy generation into the very fabric \nof the modern building envelope.\n\nClear Glass\nsolar glazing\n\nClean Energy \ngeneration offsets building \n\nenergy requirements \n\nSaves\non building heating and \n\ncooling costs\n\nClearVuePV Vision Glass combines several patented, \nproprietary technologies to generate clean, renewable \nenergy from clear building glazing surfaces. ClearVue is \ncompatible with the majority of glass compositions.\n\nBenefits\n• Generates up to 3 Watts/ft2 peak\n• Reduction of Solar Heat Gain coefficient (SHGC)\n• Fire certified by TÜV SÜD under the EN 13501-1:2018 \n\nA2-s1, d0 classification rating for combustibility\n• Provides maximum natural lighting with transparency \n\nthat is the same as standard glazing products\n• Decreases use of traditional energy sources and offsets \n\nenergy use with renewable solar energy\n• Compatible with most glass compositions and low \n\nemissive (low-e) coating technologies\n• Compatible with most standard curtain wall and \n\nframing systems\n• IGU seal equivalent to standard IGUs (Certified by \n\nInsulating Glass Certification Council) \n• Project-specific sizes available (up to 5.25ft x 11.5ft)\n• Connected reporting supported\n\n\n\nClearVuePV Vision Glass Specifications\n\nwww.clearvuepv.com\n\nClearVuePV Vision Glass allows visible light to pass through the glass at up to 70% visible light \ntransmission (VLT) for maximum daylight. ClearVue prevents unwanted solar radiation from \npenetrating the building envelope while generating energy utilizing custom-shaped solar cells along \nthe perimeter. ClearVue optimizes on site energy generation by making large expanses of building \nfaçade glass into renewable energy powerhouses.\n\nTECHNICAL PROPERTIES\nVision Glass Unit Specifications Size: 4ft x 4ft\n\nParameters Values\n\nMaximum Power Output Up to 3 Watts peak per ft2  \n\nVisible Light Transmission Up to 70%\n\nU Value Dependent on glass \ncomposition\n\nSHGC Dependent on glass \ncomposition\n\nVoltage Open Circuit Voc 58V\n\nAmperes Short Circuit Isc 0.95A\n\nMaximum Power Voltage Vmp 49V\n\nMaximum Power Current Imp 0.87A\n\nTolerance ±5%\n\nThe ClearVuePV Vision Glass System is \ncomprised of:\n• Silicon solar collectors\n• Extruded support frame and connection system\n• Fully sealed power system\n• Proprietary PVB with photo luminescent \n\nnanoparticles\n\nInternal IGU solar collection delivers \nenhanced reliability\n• All electrical connections are solid metal for \n\nenhanced reliability\n• All electrical connections are within the \n\ndesiccated IGU cavity forming a completely \nairtight, dry environment\n\n• Friction assembly system delivers a high quality \nand fast production rate, streamlining mass \nproduction that is comparable with standard IGUs\n\n• Power exit is via an IP67-certified system that is \nwaterproof to 1m of depth for 30 minutes\n\nClearVuePV Vision Glass meets stringent \nconstruction-grade fire safety requirements and \nis approved for high rise buildings.

            "To determine if a product qualifies for a domestic content adder under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), it needs to meet specific criteria for domestic manufacturing of components or materials. Based on the ClearVue Solar Facade brochure, here are key points to consider:\n\n1. **Component Manufacturing Location**: The brochure does not explicitly mention where the individual components (e.g., glass, PVB layers, silicon solar cells, or junction boxes) are manufactured. For domestic content qualification, components like the solar cells and other significant materials must be sourced or manufactured in the U.S.\n\n2. **Assembly**: It is unclear if the assembly of the product takes place in the U.S., which is another requirement for domestic content eligibility.\n\n3. **Certifications**: The product includes international certifications and compliance, but there’s no indication of specific alignment with U.S. domestic content requirements under the IRA.\n\n4. **Potential for Qualification**: If ClearVue has a manufacturing presence or partnerships in the U.S. for its key components, the product might qualify. Additional documentation from ClearVue or its suppliers would be required to verify compliance.\n\nYou may need to contact ClearVue directly or obtain detailed manufacturing and sourcing documentation to confirm eligibility for the domestic content adder."
