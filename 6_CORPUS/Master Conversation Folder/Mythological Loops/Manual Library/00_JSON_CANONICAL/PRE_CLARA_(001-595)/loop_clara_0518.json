            "Here are some potentially questionable aspects in the **EnergySage C&I 2024 Member Referral Agreement** that you may want to address or review in greater detail:\n\n1. **Payment Terms**:\n   - Referral fees are charged based on the estimated system size, which might not reflect the final project size. Ensure that you are comfortable with the risk of paying based on estimates that could change.\n\n2. **Acceptance and Rejection Clause**:\n   - If you reject a lead and later contract with that referral within one year, you will still owe the fee. This could become contentious if misunderstandings arise regarding the status of rejected referrals.\n\n3. **Termination Rights**:\n   - Either party can terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice, but your obligation to pay any outstanding referral fees survives termination. Confirm how this applies to disputes over lead quality or disagreements that lead to termination.\n\n4. **Data Disclosure**:\n   - The agreement allows EnergySage to share customer data internally and potentially with business customers. This might raise privacy concerns depending on the nature of the shared data and how it is secured.\n\n5. **Fee Adjustment**:\n   - EnergySage reserves the right to change fees with 30 days’ notice. If the new fees are unfavorable, termination of the agreement is the only remedy. Consider if this clause aligns with your risk tolerance.\n\n6. **Confidentiality and Noncompliance**:\n   - Review the language around the confidentiality obligations. There are broad exceptions, such as disclosures required by law, that might need clarification.\n\n7. **Indemnification**:\n   - The indemnity clause includes defense obligations for gross negligence or willful misconduct but leaves scope for interpretation. Ensure you’re clear about the liabilities you are assuming.\n\n8. **Compliance with Consumer Protection Rules**:\n   - The agreement imposes broad compliance requirements related to data protection and consumer rights. Ensure your processes can adhere to all specified regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other listed laws.\n\n9. **Flat Fee for Rejected Leads**:\n   - A $3,000 fee is applied if EnergySage discovers a sale after you have rejected a lead. This clause could become problematic if there’s disagreement about whether a referral originated with EnergySage.\n\n10. **Audit Rights**:\n    - EnergySage has the right to audit records relating to this agreement. Consider whether this aligns with your company’s data management policies and contractual preferences.\n\nIf you want to adjust or negotiate any of these points, it may be helpful to consult a legal advisor to ensure the agreement reflects your business interests and risk appetite. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or help drafting questions or amendments."

            "Yes, there is a clause in the agreement that appears to address situations where you might already have a relationship with a lead:\n\n### Relevant Clause:\nIn the **Acceptance and Rejection section**, it states:\n> *\"If the Company contracts with a rejected Referral within one (1) year of the date the Company provides EnergySage with written notice of its rejection, EnergySage may charge the Company the applicable Referral Fees as if such Referral had been accepted by the Company, plus an additional amount as set forth in Appendix B.\"*\n\nThis language suggests that even if you reject a lead from EnergySage, but later contract with that lead within a year, you are still obligated to pay the referral fee, regardless of whether you had an existing relationship with the lead prior to EnergySage's involvement.\n\n### Key Implications:\n1. **Pre-Existing Relationships**:\n   - The agreement doesn't explicitly carve out exceptions for leads with whom you have a prior relationship. This could result in you owing referral fees for leads EnergySage claims to have generated but that you were already in discussions with.\n\n2. **Burden of Proof**:\n   - The onus would likely be on you to prove that you had a pre-existing relationship with the lead. However, this agreement does not explicitly address how such cases would be handled, leaving it open to interpretation and potential dispute.\n\n3. **Additional Fee**:\n   - If you reject the lead and later contract with it, not only do you owe the referral fee, but also an additional fee as outlined in Appendix B (e.g., $3,000 for larger systems).\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf you commonly work with businesses that EnergySage might also refer, consider negotiating the following:\n- **Pre-Existing Relationship Clause**:\n   Add language that exempts you from paying referral fees for leads you can demonstrate were part of your existing pipeline or network prior to EnergySage's involvement.\n- **Clear Dispute Process**:\n   Establish a formal process for disputing whether a lead was genuinely sourced by EnergySage or was already known to your company.\n- **Limitations on Fee Applicability**:\n   Request a waiver of additional fees for such situations, given the lead was not generated entirely by EnergySage's efforts.\n\nLet me know if you need help drafting proposed changes to the agreement!"
