            "### Title: Bennett Schmidt and the Dinosaur Adventure  \n### Style, Genre, and Type: Epic Ballad, Folk Rock\n\n---\n\n[Intro]  \nBennett walks where the wild winds blow,  \nThrough ancient lands where the dinosaurs go.  \nHis heart beats strong, a hero untamed,  \nWith his scorpion necklace and a legend proclaimed.  \n\n---\n\n[Verse 1]  \nBennett loves the mighty T. rex, tall,  \nThe gentle Brachiosaurus standing so small.  \nTriceratops with its horns of three,  \nVelociraptor, fast and free.  \n\nHe dreams of Ankylosaurus, armored and tough,  \nSpinosaurus swimming when the waters get rough.  \nDiplodocus stretching to the tallest tree,  \nStegosaurus with plates for the world to see.  \n\nCorythosaurus, Parasaurolophus too,  \nThe fierce Allosaurus chasing through the blue.  \nIguanodon with its thumbs so grand,  \nCarnotaurus ruling the desert sand.  \n\nPachycephalosaurus with a head so thick,  \nPteranodon soaring with its aerial trick.  \n\n---\n\n[Chorus]  \nBennett loves them, one and all,  \nBig or small, they heed his call.  \nThrough time and space, they walk as friends,  \nOn a journey where the past never ends.  \n\n---\n\n[Verse 2: The Magical Necklace]  \nAround his neck, a scorpion's grace,  \nA charm of power, its rightful place.  \nIt shields him from evil, its glow a guide,  \nA guardian force by his heart's side.  \n\nBut beware, for the curse is true,  \nHe cannot take it off, no matter the view.  \nFor if he does, the darkness will rise,  \nAnd shadows will flood the starlit skies.  \n\n---\n\n[Bridge]  \nThrough the fossil fields and valleys wide,  \nBennett roams with his dino pride.  \nProtected and bold, he'll always explore,  \nA timeless hero forevermore.  \n\n---\n\n[Chorus]  \nBennett loves them, one and all,  \nBig or small, they heed his call.  \nThrough time and space, they walk as friends,  \nOn a journey where the past never ends.  \n\n---\n\n[Outro]  \nSo let the scorpion necklace shine,  \nAnd the dinosaurs march through space and time.  \nBennett Schmidt, a legend of old,  \nWith tales of adventure forever retold.  \n\n[End]"
