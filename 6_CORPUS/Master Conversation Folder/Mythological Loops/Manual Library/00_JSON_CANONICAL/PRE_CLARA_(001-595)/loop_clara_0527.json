            "Top round is a lean cut of beef that benefits from slower cooking methods or marinades to enhance flavor and tenderness. Here’s how to cook your 2.26 lb top round depending on your desired method:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Roast (Oven)**  \nGreat for an even cook and minimal effort.\n\n**Ingredients**:\n- 2.26 lb top round\n- 2 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp black pepper\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 2 garlic cloves, minced (optional)\n- 1 tsp dried rosemary or thyme (optional)\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Preheat oven** to 325°F (163°C).\n2. Rub the beef with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings.\n3. Sear the beef in a hot skillet (2–3 minutes per side) to create a crust.\n4. Place the beef in a roasting pan with a rack or on a bed of vegetables.\n5. Roast until the internal temperature is:\n   - 120–125°F (49–52°C) for rare\n   - 130–135°F (54–57°C) for medium-rare\n   - 140–145°F (60–63°C) for medium\n6. Remove, tent with foil, and let rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Slow Cooker**  \nThis method ensures tenderness by cooking the meat low and slow.\n\n**Ingredients**:\n- 2.26 lb top round\n- 1 cup beef broth\n- 1/4 cup soy sauce\n- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n- 1 onion, sliced\n- 2 carrots, chopped\n- 2 celery stalks, chopped\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then sear in a hot skillet.\n2. Place the beef in the slow cooker and add the vegetables and liquids.\n3. Cook on **low for 6–8 hours** or **high for 4–5 hours**, until fork-tender.\n4. Slice thinly and serve with the cooking juices as gravy.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Grill**  \nFor a smoky, charred exterior.\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Marinate the beef overnight in a mix of olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and herbs.\n2. Preheat the grill to medium heat.\n3. Grill for about 8–10 minutes per side, flipping once.\n4. Rest for 10 minutes, then slice thinly.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Pan-Seared and Braised**  \nPerfect for a tender, flavorful result.\n\n**Ingredients**:\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 cup beef broth\n- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)\n- 1 onion, sliced\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Season and sear the beef in olive oil until browned.\n2. Add broth, wine, and onions to the pan.\n3. Cover and simmer on low heat for 1.5–2 hours, flipping occasionally.\n4. Slice thinly and serve with the pan sauce.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help picking the best method or additional sides to pair?"
