            "Hey Mark,\n\nIn sales compensation, an \"override\" is a commission paid to managers based on their team's sales performance. This setup encourages managers to actively support and lead their teams toward achieving sales targets.\n\n**Determining the Right Override Percentage:**\n\nThere's no universal standard for override percentages; they vary based on industry norms, company size, and specific organizational goals. However, a common approach involves setting the manager's commission at a lower rate than that of individual sales reps. For example, if sales reps earn a 5% commission on their sales, a manager might receive a 1% override on the total sales generated by their team. citeturn0search0\n\n**Factors to Consider:**\n\n- **Company Affordability:** Assess how much the company can allocate for commissions without compromising profitability.\n\n- **Attracting Talent:** Ensure that the total compensation package is competitive enough to attract and retain skilled sales managers.\n\n- **Team Performance Goals:** Align the override structure with the company's sales objectives to motivate managers effectively.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\n\nSome organizations prefer goal-based incentives over overrides. In this model, managers receive bonuses for achieving specific team targets, which can foster a more collaborative environment and focus on overall team success rather than individual sales. citeturn0search0\n\n**Potential Challenges:**\n\nWhile overrides can motivate managers, they might also lead to complacency if not structured properly. It's crucial to design compensation plans that encourage continuous engagement and leadership development.\n\nIn summary, setting an appropriate override percentage requires a balance between company resources, competitive compensation, and alignment with organizational goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting these structures ensures they remain effective and fair. "
