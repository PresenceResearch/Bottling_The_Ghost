            "The original lyrics to \"Maryland, My Maryland,\" written by James Ryder Randall in 1861, were inspired by the Civil War and are written from a Confederate perspective. The song was adopted as Maryland's state song in 1939 but was repealed as the state song in 2021 due to its controversial and divisive content.\n\nHere is the text of the original lyrics:\n\n---\n\n**Maryland, My Maryland**  \nThe despot's heel is on thy shore,  \nMaryland!  \nHis torch is at thy temple door,  \nMaryland!  \nAvenge the patriotic gore  \nThat flecked the streets of Baltimore,  \nAnd be the battle queen of yore,  \nMaryland! My Maryland!\n\nHark! 'Tis the watchman's honest cry,  \nMaryland!  \nFrom hill to hill, from vale to vale,  \nMaryland!  \nVirginia should not call in vain,  \nMaryland!  \nShe meets her sisters on the plain—  \nSic semper! 'tis the proud refrain  \nThat baffles minions back amain,  \nMaryland! My Maryland!\n\nI see the blush upon thy cheek,  \nMaryland!  \nFor thou wast ever bravely meek,  \nMaryland!  \nBut lo! There surges forth a shriek  \nFrom hill to hill, from creek to creek,  \nPotomac calls to Chesapeake,  \nMaryland! My Maryland!\n\nThou wilt not cower in the dust,  \nMaryland!  \nThy beaming sword shall never rust,  \nMaryland!  \nRemember Carroll's sacred trust,  \nRemember Howard's warlike thrust,—  \nAnd all thy slumberers with the just,  \nMaryland! My Maryland!\n\nCome! 'tis the red dawn of the day,  \nMaryland!  \nCome with thy panoplied array,  \nMaryland!  \nWith Ringgold's spirit for the fray,  \nWith Watson's blood at Monterey,  \nWith fearless Lowe and dashing May,  \nMaryland! My Maryland!\n\nDear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain,  \nMaryland!  \nVirginia should not call in vain,  \nMaryland!  \nShe meets her sisters on the plain—  \nSic semper! 'tis the proud refrain  \nThat baffles minions back amain,  \nMaryland! My Maryland!\n\n---\n\nThe song is set to the melody of \"O Tannenbaum\" and was controversial because of its explicit Confederate sympathies and use of language calling for resistance against the Union during the Civil War."
