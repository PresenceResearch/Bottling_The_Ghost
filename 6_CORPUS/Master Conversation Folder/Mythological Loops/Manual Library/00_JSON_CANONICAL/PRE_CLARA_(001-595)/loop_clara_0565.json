FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION \r\nA. Background and Summary \r\nThe EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) is issuing this NOFO to announce the \r\navailability of funds and solicit applications from eligible entities to help ports nationwide \r\ntransition to zero-emission (ZE) operations under the EPA’s Clean Ports Program. The EPA’s\r\nClean Ports Program will fund ZE port equipment and infrastructure to reduce mobile source \r\nemissions (criteria pollutants, air toxics, and/or greenhouse gases) at United States ports, \r\ndelivering cleaner air for communities across the country. The Clean Ports Program will also \r\nfund climate and air quality planning activities as part of a separate NOFO – including emissions \r\ninventories, strategy analysis, community engagement, and resiliency measure identification –\r\nthat will build the capacity of port stakeholders to continue to reduce pollution and transition \r\nto ZE operations over time. This new funding opportunity, made possible by funding from the \r\nInflation Reduction Act, builds on the EPA’s Ports Initiative, an ongoing program that helps our \r\nnation’s ports, a critical part of our infrastructure and supply chain, address public health and\r\nenvironmental impacts on surrounding communities. \r\nPorts are a vital part of the United States economy, serving as gateways for moving freight and \r\npassengers across the country and around the world. Ports are also places with high \r\nconcentrations of mobile source equipment, including dray trucks, locomotives, cargo-handling \r\nequipment, and marine vessels. This equipment is largely powered by diesel and other fossil \r\nfuels. Older equipment, in particular, can emit significant amounts of air pollution, including \r\nfine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), air toxics, and carbon dioxide (CO2), \r\nwhich impact human health and the environment. \r\nSection 60102 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) amended Section 133 of the Clean \r\nAir Act (42 U.S.C. 7433) to authorize the EPA’s Clean Ports Program (or Grants to Reduce Air \r\nPollution at Ports). \r\nThe EPA anticipates awarding up to $2.79 billion under this competition, subject to the \r\navailability of funds, the quantity and quality of applications received, and other applicable \r\nconsiderations. This NOFO announces the availability of funding for grants related to ZE \r\nTechnology Deployment. The EPA has issued a separate NOFO under Funding Opportunity \r\nNumber EPA-R-OAR-CPP-24-05 for a competition for climate and air quality planning activities. \r\nApplicants are encouraged to apply to both grant competitions. Across both competitions, a \r\nminimum of $750 million is available for projects in nonattainment areas for PM2.5 or ozone, as \r\ndefined in Section IV.C.2., Section 4. \r\nThis Clean Ports Program ZE Technology Deployment Competition is a competitive grant \r\nprogram. Funding for port equipment, infrastructure, and planning is also available through \r\nother programs funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. \r\nThe EPA’s Ports Initiative has a searchable table of funding opportunities that can support \r\nemissions reductions at ports. In addition, the Department of Energy, in coordination with the \r\n5 ",

Program Goals and Objectives \r\nThe EPA’s goals for the Clean Ports Program are to: (1) build a foundation for ports across the \r\ncountry to transition to fully ZE operations, positioning ports to serve as a catalyst for \r\ntransformational change across the freight sector; (2) reduce mobile source pollution in near\u0002port communities, especially disadvantaged communities; and (3) help ensure that meaningful \r\ncommunity engagement and emissions reduction planning are port industry standard practices. \r\nThe ZE Technology Deployment Competition is designed to fund deployment of strategies and \r\nsolutions that will help ports achieve zero-emission operations. This includes funding the \r\npurchase of ZE equipment, technologies, and related infrastructure directly serving a port, as \r\nwell as funding support expenses related to deployment. For the purpose of this funding \r\nopportunity, “ZE equipment” means a mobile source that produces zero tailpipe emissions of\r\nany criteria pollutant, air toxics, or greenhouse gas other than water vapor, specifically electric \r\nand hydrogen fuel cell technologies. Project activities eligible for funding under this NOFO \r\ninclude: \r\n1. ZE Mobile Equipment: Eligible project costs include the purchase and deployment of \r\nnew eligible battery-electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, vessels, powertrains, and \r\nother mobile equipment that directly serve a port, which fall in these general categories: \r\n• Cargo handling equipment (e.g., terminal tractors, forklifts, top handlers, side picks, \r\nstraddle carriers) \r\n• Drayage trucks \r\n• Locomotives and railcar movers \r\n• Harbor craft and other vessels (e.g., commercial and Tribal fishing vessels, tugs, \r\nferries, patrol boats, workboats, dredges, pilot boats, barges) \r\n2. ZE Infrastructure Serving Mobile Equipment: Eligible project costs include the purchase \r\nand installation of new or expanded electric charging and/or hydrogen fueling \r\ninfrastructure serving eligible ZE port equipment purchased as part of the applicant’s \r\ngrant award, as well as shore power infrastructure for marine vessels. Equipment not \r\npurchased as part of the grant award may also utilize the charging and fueling \r\ninfrastructure. Specifically: \r\n• Eligible electric charging infrastructure should be located at or behind the meter \r\n(customer side). Eligible costs include but are not limited to: electric supply \r\ninfrastructure for the new electric equipment, including the unit and charging cable, \r\nmount and/or pedestal, electrical panels, and their installation; upgrades to existing \r\nelectrical panels or electrical service, wiring/conduit and its installation; the physical \r\nmeter and its housing unit (if located on the customer side); and installation, such as \r\ndesign and engineering or labor (i.e., infrastructure costs associated with work on \r\n6 ",

These criteria include having more than 50,000 20-foot equivalent \r\nunits per year or 100 trucks per day, or comprising more than 20 percent of freight \r\nvolumes handled by any mode within a State. \r\nFor purposes of this NOFO, a small water port is defined as: \r\n• A water port (see definition above) located in a port area to and from which the \r\naverage annual tonnage of cargo is less than 8,000,000 short tons for the most \r\nrecent three calendar years of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) data (2019, \r\n2020, 2021), or \r\n• A water port located outside of the port areas in USACE tonnage datasets. \r\nA list of eligible dry port facilities and a list of port areas that handle greater than 8,000,000 \r\nshort tons are available on the Clean Ports Program website. \r\nIn order to promote geographic and port-type diversity, the EPA plans to award a minimum \r\nnumber of grants to Tribal applicants, a minimum amount of funding for projects taking place at \r\nsmall water ports, and a minimum number of projects in each of the EPA’s ten Regions, as \r\ndescribed in Section II.B. Although projects at dry ports are eligible, the EPA plans to set a \r\nmaximum funding amount for projects taking place at dry ports, as described in Section II.B. \r\nEligible applications will be sorted into award tiers based on the amount of funding requested, \r\nthe port type, and the applicant type. An overview of the ZE Technology Deployment Award \r\nTiers is shown in Table 1. Applications in each tier will be evaluated and ranked against other \r\napplications within the same tier. Applicants should include information in the cover page of \r\nthe project narrative about whether their project is scalable and the minimum amount of \r\nfunding they would accept. This flexibility may provide a benefit to the applicant in the event \r\nthat the EPA cannot fund the full project amount. \r\n8 ",

FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION \r\nA. Amount of Funding Available \r\nThe total estimated funding expected to be available for awards under this competitive \r\nopportunity is $2.79 billion. Funding is dependent upon funding availability, Agency priorities, \r\nand other applicable considerations. \r\nAs described in Section I.A. and per the statute, the EPA intends to award a minimum of $750M \r\nfor projects in nonattainment areas across both this NOFO (EPA-R-OAR-CPP-24-04 Clean Ports \r\nProgram: Zero-Emission Technology Deployment Competition), and EPA-R-OAR-CPP-24-05 \r\nClean Ports Program: Climate and Air Quality Planning Competition. \r\nB. Number and Amount of Awards \r\nThe EPA anticipates awarding 32 to 90 grants or cooperative agreements under this \r\nannouncement, subject to the availability of funds, the quantity and quality of applications \r\nreceived, Agency priorities, and other applicable considerations. \r\nThe EPA expects to award grants within three tiers based on project size and applicant type, as \r\ndescribed in Table 2 below. Tier A is for projects between $150 million and $500 million. Tier B \r\nis for projects less than $150 million. Tier C is only for Tribal applicants. The EPA anticipates \r\nawarding 5-10 grants under Tier A, 25-70 grants under Tier B, and 2-10 grants under Tier C of \r\nthis competition. Applications in each tier will be evaluated and ranked against other \r\napplications within the same tier. \r\nTier A is open to projects taking place at water ports. Tier B is open to projects taking place at \r\nwater ports and/or dry ports. The EPA expects to award a maximum of $250 million total for \r\nprojects taking place at dry ports. \r\nThe EPA expects to award at least $250 million total to projects taking place at small water \r\nports. For applications that include projects taking place at multiple ports, the primary project \r\nlocation (based on percentage of time/activity) will be used to determine whether the project \r\nqualifies as taking place at a small water port. A small water port is defined as: \r\n• A water port located in a port area to and from which the average annual \r\ntonnage of cargo is less than 8,000,000 short tons for the most recent three \r\ncalendar years of USACE data (2019, 2020, 2021), or \r\n• A water port located outside of the port areas in USACE tonnage datasets. \r\nA list of port areas that handle greater than 8,000,000 short tons is available on the Clean Ports \r\nProgram website. \r\nTo ensure further geographic and port type diversity, the EPA plans to award a minimum of one \r\naward per each of the EPA’s ten Regions under this Competition. \r\n13 ",

The EPA has determined that \r\nbased on the exclusion of Alaskan Native Corporations (ANCs) from the definition of “Indian\r\ntribe” in Section 302(r) of the Clean Air Act, that ANCs are not eligible as a Tribal agency for \r\ndirect grants from the EPA under this program. ANCs may be eligible as a private entity, \r\nhowever, and may receive subawards from eligible grantees. \r\nFor the purposes of this NOFO, “intertribal consortium” is defined as a partnership between\r\ntwo or more eligible Tribal agencies as defined above, that is authorized by the governing \r\nbodies of those Tribes to apply for and receive assistance under this program. Intertribal \r\nconsortia are eligible to receive assistance under this program only if the consortium \r\ndemonstrates that all members of the consortium meet the eligibility requirements for the \r\nprogram and authorize the consortium to apply for and receive assistance by submitting to the \r\nEPA documentation of (1) the existence of the partnership between Indian Tribal governments, \r\nand (2) authorization of the consortium by all its members to apply for and receive the \r\nassistance. \r\nA private entity can include for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations, as long as they \r\nmeet the requirements described in Section III.A.4.a-b. For example, a private marine terminal \r\noperator could be an eligible private entity. \r\nAs described in Section VI.F., by applying under this NOFO, applicants attest that they are not \r\n(A) owned by, controlled by, or subject to the direction of a government of a foreign country of \r\nconcern, or (B) headquartered in a foreign country of concern. \r\nA partnership between an eligible private entity (as defined above in Section III.A.4.) \r\nand another eligible non-private entity (as defined above in Section III.A.1-3.) is a Statutory \r\nPartnership. The Statutory Partnership application is comprised of one eligible private entity \r\nwho enters into a Statutory Partnership Agreement with one or more Statutory Partners (other \r\neligible non-private entities). In a Statutory Partnership application, the eligible private entity is \r\nconsidered the grant recipient and is responsible for carrying out the grant activities if the \r\napplication is selected for funding. If the application is selected for award, the applicant will \r\nenter into an agreement with the Statutory Partner that must contain the elements of the \r\nStatutory Partnership Agreement in Appendix B. The applicant must include a copy of a written \r\nand signed Statutory Partnership Agreement with their application to be eligible for funding \r\nconsideration. \r\n16 ",

Cost Sharing or Matching Funds \r\nAny form of cost share, mandatory or voluntary, must be included in the budget detail portion \r\nof the project narrative, and the application must describe how and when the applicant will \r\nfurnish the cost share and how the cost share funding will be used. Applicants may use their \r\nown funds or other sources for cost share if the standards of 2 CFR Part 200, as applicable, are \r\nmet. If the proposed cost share is to be provided by a named Statutory Partner and/or \r\nCollaborating Entity, applicants are strongly encouraged to include a description of the \r\nprovided cost share in an attached Statutory Partnership Agreement or letter of commitment. \r\nOnly eligible and allowable costs may be used for cost share. \r\nProjects are subject to the mandatory cost share requirement based on the application tier, as \r\nshown below in Table 3. For territory applicants (the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, \r\nGuam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), up to $5 million of the \r\napplicant cost share will be waived, in accordance with the policies of the Omnibus Territories \r\nAct. \r\nThe cost share applies to the total project cost. For example, if a project costs $160 million, the \r\nEPA share would be $144 million (90% of $160 million) and the mandatory applicant share \r\nwould be $16 million (10% of $160 million). In this example, the project is in Tier B because the \r\nEPA share is less than $150 million, even though the total project cost is greater than $150 \r\nmillion. For territory applicants, the applicant share in this example would be $11 million \r\n(because up to $5 million of the cost share is waived), and the EPA share would be $149 million. \r\nIn-kind administrative and implementation costs count towards the applicant cost share. State, \r\nTribal, local, and private funds may be used as the applicant cost share. Other federal grants \r\nmay not be used as the cost share unless the statute authorizing that federal funding provides \r\nthat the funds may be used to meet cost share requirements on a federal grant. \r\n18 ",

Unlike funding \r\nawarded by the EPA and mandatory cost share funds provided by the recipient as part of this \r\nfunding opportunity, leveraged resources do not need to be spent on eligible or allowable costs \r\nas listed in Section I.B. Unlike the mandatory cost share, these resources should not be included \r\nin the project budget on the SF-424 or SF-424A. \r\nIf applicants propose to leverage funds, the EPA expects them to secure the leveraged \r\nresources described in their applications.

Voluntary cost sharing is when an applicant voluntarily proposes to legally commit to \r\nprovide costs or contributions to support the project when a cost share is not required. \r\nApplicants who propose to use a voluntary cost share must include the costs or contributions \r\nfor the voluntary cost share in the project budget on the SF-424 and SF-424A. If an applicant \r\nproposes a voluntary cost share, the following apply: \r\n• A voluntary cost share is subject to the applicable provisions of 2 CFR § 200.306, \r\nCost sharing or matching. \r\n• A voluntary cost share may only be met with eligible and allowable costs. \r\n• The recipient may not use other sources of federal funds to meet a voluntary cost \r\nshare unless the statute authorizing the other federal funding provides that the \r\nfederal funds may be used to meet a cost share requirement on a federal grant or \r\ncooperative agreement. \r\nThe recipient is legally obligated to meet any proposed voluntary cost share that is included in \r\nthe approved project budget. If the proposed voluntary cost share does not materialize during \r\nthe performance period of the grant or cooperative agreement, the EPA may reconsider the \r\nlegitimacy of the award and/or take other appropriate action as authorized by 2 CFR Part 200. \r\nC. Threshold Eligibility Criteria \r\nAll applications will be reviewed for eligibility and must meet the eligibility requirements \r\ndescribed in Sections III.A., B., and C., to be considered eligible. If necessary, the EPA may \r\ncontact applicants to clarify threshold eligibility questions prior to making an eligibility \r\ndetermination. Applicants deemed ineligible for funding consideration due to the threshold \r\neligibility review will be notified within 15 calendar days of the ineligibility determination. \r\n1.

APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION \r\nNote: Additional provisions that apply to this section can be found at EPA Solicitation Clauses. \r\nA. How to Register to Apply for Grants under this Competition \r\nNote: The registration process can take a month or more. We advise you to start the process as \r\nsoon as possible so that it does not overlap or interfere with finalizing your application. \r\nApplicants should visit How to Register to Apply for Grants for additional information. All EPA \r\ngrant applications must be submitted online, except in limited circumstances. Organizations \r\nmust be registered in two government systems to apply for EPA grants: \r\n1. The System for Award Management (SAM.gov) registers organizations to conduct \r\nbusiness with the U.S. Government, which includes federal grants. \r\n2. Grants.gov is the official system for managing all federal grant applications. \r\nThese two systems share information. Together, they provide access to everything needed to \r\nidentify federal grant opportunities and to complete the online application process. \r\nNote that individuals access both systems through a single user account set up in Login.gov. \r\nCreating a Login.gov account is easy. If you do not have a Login.gov account, you will be \r\nprompted to create one when you register with SAM.gov or Grants.gov. Learn more about \r\nLogin.gov. \r\n25 ",

Organizations \r\nshould ensure that their SAM.gov registration includes a current e-Business (EBiz) point of \r\ncontact name and email address. The EBiz point of contact is critical for Grants.gov Registration \r\nand system functionality. If the point of contact has changed, you may need to contact \r\nthe Federal Service Desk for help with your SAM.gov account: (866) 606-8220. The Federal \r\nService desk hours of operation are Monday – Friday 8am – 8pm ET. \r\nPlease note that SAM.gov registration is different than obtaining a UEI only. Obtaining an UEI \r\nonly validates your organization’s legal business name and address. Please review \r\nthe Frequently Asked Questions document for additional details. \r\nFollow these steps to register to apply for EPA grants. Start the registration process early. The \r\nprocess can take a month or more. Errors or inconsistencies in registration in the two systems \r\ncan prolong the process. Applicants are encouraged to start the registration process before you \r\nbegin your application. \r\nStep 1. Register Your Organization in SAM.gov \r\nOrganizations must register with SAM.gov to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), which is a \r\n12-character alphanumeric identifier assigned to each unique organization. There is no fee for \r\nregistering with SAM.gov and registration must be renewed annually. \r\nRegistration in SAM.gov requires providing assertions, representations and certifications, and \r\nother information so that the federal government can verify the existence and uniqueness of \r\nthe organization. Follow these steps to get started: \r\n1. Go to the SAM.gov Entity Registration page. Review the “Before You Get Started”\r\nsection and download the Entity Registration Checklist to help prepare. \r\n2. Click the “Get Started” button when you are ready. You may be prompted to accept the\r\nusage terms and sign in through Login.gov. If necessary, click the “Get Started” button\r\nagain after you sign in. \r\n3.

            "Rooftop solar that is **net metered** could qualify under specific conditions of the **Clean Ports Program**, but its eligibility depends on how it directly supports zero-emission (ZE) operations at the port. Here’s a breakdown of the factors:\n\n---\n\n### **Does Rooftop Solar Qualify?**\n1. **Eligible Solar Projects**:\n   - Solar power systems are explicitly mentioned as eligible **if they are installed to power ZE mobile equipment**, such as charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) or other port-related infrastructure.\n   - The system must **directly serve the port** or ZE equipment and meet other program requirements.\n\n2. **Net-Metered Systems**:\n   - If the net-metered rooftop solar is used to power ZE equipment or reduce the overall carbon footprint of port operations, it may qualify. \n   - However, systems that solely export power to the grid without directly powering port equipment are **less likely to qualify**, as the funding focuses on direct emissions reductions tied to port activities.\n\n---\n\n### **Utility-Supplied Electricity and Emissions**\n- Electricity purchased from the utility is often considered \"indirect emissions\" because it depends on how the utility generates its power. For example:\n  - **Renewable sources** (e.g., wind, solar) result in **low or no emissions**.\n  - **Fossil fuel-based sources** (e.g., coal, natural gas) contribute to emissions.\n- The program’s goal is to directly reduce **mobile source emissions**, so utility-supplied electricity isn’t typically factored into a port's direct emissions profile. However, transitioning port operations to renewable electricity (via rooftop solar, for example) aligns with the program’s long-term goals.\n\n---\n\n### **What to Consider for Rooftop Solar Projects?**\nTo qualify:\n1. The solar project must be **integrated** into a larger ZE strategy:\n   - Powering electric charging infrastructure.\n   - Supporting battery storage systems for port operations.\n2. Applicants should demonstrate how the solar project contributes to **reducing mobile source emissions** or supports ZE equipment at the port.\n3. Compliance with **Build America, Buy America (BABA)** and program-specific requirements for infrastructure installation is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- Utility-supplied electricity is not directly considered emissions under this program, but transitioning port operations to self-generated renewable electricity (like rooftop solar) could align with the program's emissions-reduction goals.\n- Rooftop solar can qualify **if it directly powers ZE equipment or infrastructure**, not just offsets emissions through grid exports.\n\nIf you’re considering a specific project, let me know the details, and I can help clarify its eligibility!"

            "Yes, **net-metered solar** can still support charging infrastructure, but there are some nuances you’ll need to consider for it to align with the **Clean Ports Program** requirements. Here's how it works and what to watch out for:\n\n---\n\n### **How Net-Metered Solar Can Support Charging Infrastructure**\n1. **Direct Power Usage**:\n   - Even if a rooftop solar system is net-metered, it can still provide **direct power** to electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure during the day when the sun is shining.\n   - The charging infrastructure could use the solar energy generated on-site, reducing the reliance on grid electricity.\n\n2. **Indirect Power via the Grid**:\n   - During periods when the solar system overproduces electricity, the excess power is sent back to the grid (net metering).\n   - At night or during high-demand periods, the charging infrastructure may pull power from the grid, effectively offset by the solar system’s contributions.\n\n---\n\n### **Does Net Metering Affect Eligibility?**\n- **Direct Integration with ZE Equipment**:\n   - The program prioritizes solar systems that are directly tied to powering zero-emission (ZE) equipment or infrastructure (e.g., charging stations).\n   - Net-metered solar can qualify if you can demonstrate that the solar power offsets or directly supports the electricity demand of the charging infrastructure.\n\n- **Documentation and Impact**:\n   - You’ll need to show how the solar system contributes to reducing emissions associated with the charging infrastructure.\n   - For example, you could document the energy produced by the solar system and how much of that offsets the charging infrastructure’s electricity demand.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges with Net Metering**\n1. **Program Focus on On-Site Use**:\n   - The program may view net-metered systems less favorably if the majority of the solar energy is exported to the grid and not used on-site for ZE infrastructure.\n   - Ensure the solar system is sized and designed to align closely with the charging infrastructure’s energy needs.\n\n2. **Regulatory and Grid Dependency**:\n   - Net-metering policies depend on state regulations, and the utility-supplied electricity might still have some emissions tied to it.\n   - While grid-exported solar reduces overall emissions, the program emphasizes direct reductions at the port level.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Practices to Align Net-Metered Solar with Program Goals**\n1. **Battery Storage Integration**:\n   - Adding battery storage to the solar system ensures the charging infrastructure can draw from solar energy even when the sun isn’t shining, reducing reliance on grid power.\n   - This strengthens your application by emphasizing direct emissions reductions.\n\n2. **Energy Management Software**:\n   - Use software to track how much solar energy is directly powering the ZE infrastructure. This data can help prove the system's impact on emissions reduction.\n\n3. **Highlight Environmental Benefits**:\n   - Clearly demonstrate how the net-metered solar system contributes to emissions reductions and supports the program’s environmental justice and ZE goals.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nYes, net-metered solar can support charging infrastructure and still qualify, but the key is **demonstrating direct support and emissions reduction** for ZE equipment. Pairing the system with battery storage or energy management systems can further strengthen its alignment with the program’s objectives.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help structuring a proposal or understanding the technical details!"

            "If the expected increase in electricity consumption (e.g., due to EV charging or other ZE infrastructure) can be completely offset by installing a **net-metered solar system**, it strengthens the case for the system's eligibility under the **Clean Ports Program**, as it demonstrates direct alignment with emissions reduction goals. Here's how this scenario fits into the program’s framework and what to consider:\n\n---\n\n### **Eligibility Alignment:**\n1. **Zero-Emission Alignment**:\n   - By offsetting the increased electricity demand with clean, renewable energy, the net-metered solar system effectively supports the **zero-emission (ZE)** transition.\n   - Even if the solar energy is exported to the grid during some periods, the offset ensures that the charging infrastructure’s net energy consumption doesn’t rely on fossil fuels, thus achieving emissions reductions.\n\n2. **Direct Support for ZE Infrastructure**:\n   - The Clean Ports Program focuses on funding projects that **directly** support ZE equipment and reduce emissions at ports.\n   - If the net-metered solar system is installed specifically to offset the electricity consumption of EV chargers, battery storage systems, or other ZE equipment, it is likely to meet the program’s requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points to Address in Your Application:**\n1. **Energy Offset Documentation**:\n   - Provide calculations or projections showing that the solar system’s annual production is sufficient to offset the expected electricity demand of the new ZE equipment or infrastructure.\n   - Highlight the system’s ability to \"net out\" emissions associated with the increased grid electricity use.\n\n2. **Demonstrate Port-Centric Benefits**:\n   - Ensure the proposal clearly links the solar system to port operations. For example:\n     - “The system will directly offset the energy consumption of [X charging stations] serving [Y number of vehicles] operating at the port.”\n     - “By offsetting electricity usage, the system will prevent [Z metric tons] of greenhouse gas emissions annually.”\n\n3. **Environmental Justice and Community Impact**:\n   - If the solar system helps reduce reliance on grid electricity from fossil fuel sources, emphasize the benefit for nearby communities, especially if they are overburdened by air pollution (a priority of the program).\n\n4. **Compliance with Build America, Buy America (BABA)**:\n   - Ensure the solar system components and installation meet the BABA requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Challenges and Solutions:**\n1. **Indirect Emissions Question**:\n   - While grid electricity itself doesn’t produce \"direct emissions\" at the point of use, the program prioritizes reductions in overall emissions tied to port activities.\n   - Solution: Emphasize that the solar installation ensures the additional energy demand doesn’t lead to increased reliance on fossil-fuel-based grid power.\n\n2. **Peak Demand and Intermittency**:\n   - If the solar system cannot produce power during peak demand periods (e.g., at night), consider integrating **battery storage** to ensure consistent renewable energy use.\n\n3. **Net Metering Policies**:\n   - Be aware of local/state net metering rules. Some utilities cap credits or require buybacks at lower rates, which could affect financial and emissions reduction calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Strengthening the Case**:\n1. **Full Offset = Real Emissions Reductions**:\n   - If you can prove that all the additional electricity consumption is offset by renewable energy, the project meets the emissions reduction goals of the program.\n\n2. **Tracking and Reporting**:\n   - Include plans for monitoring the system’s performance to ensure it consistently offsets consumption (e.g., using software to track solar generation versus energy usage).\n\n3. **Scaling Benefits**:\n   - Emphasize that the project could serve as a replicable model for other ports transitioning to ZE operations using net-metered systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nA net-metered solar system that completely offsets the expected increase in electricity consumption can qualify under the Clean Ports Program if:\n- The system directly supports ZE infrastructure.\n- The offset is clearly documented and aligns with emissions reduction goals.\n\nStrengthen your application by emphasizing the system's role in achieving zero-emission operations, demonstrating measurable impacts, and ensuring compliance with program requirements.

            "The key difference between **direct connection** and **net metered** solar systems lies in how the energy generated by the solar panels is used and integrated with the electrical grid. Here's a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Direct Connection**\nA **direct connection** means the solar system is physically and electrically connected to the equipment or facility it powers, without relying on the utility grid for energy distribution.\n\n#### **How it Works**:\n- **Solar energy flows directly** to the equipment (e.g., EV chargers) being powered.\n- Excess solar energy that is not used is often stored in **on-site batteries** or is lost if no storage is available.\n- The equipment draws electricity directly from the solar panels when sunlight is available, and from the grid or batteries when solar isn’t producing enough power.\n\n#### **Advantages**:\n1. **Full utilization of solar energy** on-site.\n2. **Immediate emissions reductions**, as the equipment uses renewable energy directly.\n3. Does not rely on net metering policies or grid interactions.\n\n#### **Challenges**:\n- Requires careful sizing to match the equipment's energy needs.\n- May require battery storage to provide power when solar production is low (e.g., at night).\n\n---\n\n### **Net Metered Solar**\nA **net-metered** solar system is connected to the **utility grid**. Energy produced by the solar system is either consumed on-site or exported to the grid, depending on the energy demand and solar production at any given time.\n\n#### **How it Works**:\n- Solar energy powers on-site equipment (e.g., EV chargers) **first**. Any surplus is sent back to the grid.\n- When on-site demand exceeds solar production (e.g., at night), the equipment draws power from the grid.\n- Net metering allows the user to \"bank\" energy credits for the excess electricity sent to the grid. These credits offset the cost of energy drawn from the grid later.\n\n#### **Advantages**:\n1. **Energy credits** help offset costs, making the system financially viable even when solar production doesn’t match demand.\n2. Simplifies installation by leveraging the grid as a backup.\n3. No need for large on-site battery storage (though batteries can still enhance the system).\n\n#### **Challenges**:\n1. Emissions reductions are **indirect**, as the grid acts as an intermediary. The system doesn’t guarantee that the grid is using clean energy when you draw from it.\n2. Reliant on local/state **net metering policies**, which can vary widely. For example:\n   - Some utilities provide 1:1 credit for energy sent back to the grid.\n   - Others may offer lower rates or cap the amount of energy eligible for net metering.\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison of Key Differences**\n\n| Feature                  | **Direct Connection**                                  | **Net Metered**                                       |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Energy Use**           | Energy is used directly by the equipment or stored.   | Energy is used on-site first; excess goes to the grid. |\n| **Reliance on Grid**     | Minimal (only for backup, if connected at all).       | Relies on the grid for exporting excess and importing energy. |\n| **Emissions Reductions** | Immediate and direct.                                 | Indirect; depends on grid policies and energy mix.    |\n| **Excess Energy**        | Requires batteries to store or may be wasted.         | Exported to the grid for credits (if allowed).        |\n| **Policy Dependency**    | No reliance on net metering policies.                 | Dependent on net metering rules and rates.            |\n| **System Complexity**    | May require additional storage solutions.             | Simpler setup without battery storage.                |\n\n---\n\n### **Which Is Better for the Clean Ports Program?**\n- **Direct Connection** is more closely aligned with the program’s goal of directly reducing emissions, as it ensures the solar energy is used exclusively for port-related ZE infrastructure.\n- **Net Metered** systems are also eligible but require documentation showing that the energy offsets the increased electricity demand (e.g., for EV chargers). Emissions reductions are less direct and more dependent on the grid's energy mix.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**:\n- **Direct Connection**: Solar energy goes straight to the equipment, ensuring immediate and direct emissions reductions.\n- **Net Metered**: Solar energy offsets grid electricity use, with emissions reductions depending on the local grid mix and policies.\n\nThe choice depends on your project's goals, local net metering rules, and infrastructure setup.

            "Yes, solar projects, including those tied to net metering or direct connection, can typically qualify for the **Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)** for solar energy systems. However, eligibility depends on meeting specific criteria. Here's a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Federal Tax Credit for Solar (ITC) Basics**\nThe Federal Investment Tax Credit allows businesses or individuals to deduct a percentage of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their federal taxes. As of 2025, this percentage is:\n\n- **30% for most solar installations** (under the Inflation Reduction Act).\n- Additional incentives (potentially increasing the credit above 30%) are available if certain criteria are met (e.g., domestic manufacturing or location in disadvantaged communities).\n\n---\n\n### **Eligibility for the Tax Credit**\nSolar projects supporting ports or charging infrastructure, including net-metered and direct-connection systems"

            "If a solar project is funded using **federal grant money**, it may still be eligible for the **Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**, but **only for the portion of the project not funded by the grant**. Federal tax law prohibits \"double-dipping,\" meaning you can't claim a tax credit on expenses already covered by federal funds.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works:**\n1. **Grant-Funded Portion Is Excluded**:\n   - The ITC applies only to the portion of the project paid for with **non-federal funds** (e.g., private capital, loans, state or local grants, or personal/business funds).\n   - For example, if 50% of the project is funded by a federal grant, only the remaining 50% of the costs can qualify for the ITC.\n\n2. **Non-Federal Match Counts**:\n   - If the project includes matching funds (required or voluntary), these non-federal funds are eligible for the tax credit.\n\n3. **Documentation**:\n   - You must clearly document the funding sources for the project to ensure compliance with tax rules.\n\n---\n\n### **Example**:\nLet’s say a solar system costs $1 million, and:\n- A federal grant covers **60%** ($600,000).\n- Non-federal sources cover **40%** ($400,000).\n\nOnly the $400,000 funded with non-federal dollars is eligible for the ITC. At a 30% credit rate:\n- Tax credit = $400,000 × 30% = **$120,000**.\n\n---\n\n### **What About State/Local Grants?**\nState or local grants **do not disqualify** the project from claiming the ITC. However:\n- The IRS may treat some state grants as income, which could have tax implications for the recipient.\n\n---\n\n### **Special Considerations for Clean Energy Grants and Credits**\nUnder the **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)**, there are additional opportunities to stack incentives:\n1. **Direct Pay Option** (for tax-exempt entities like nonprofits, tribes, or municipalities):\n   - Instead of a tax credit, certain entities can receive a **cash payment** equivalent to the ITC.\n2. **Bonus Credits**:\n   - Projects in **disadvantaged communities**, using **domestically produced components**, or meeting **prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements** may qualify for additional credits beyond the base 30%.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**:\nIf your project uses federal grant money, you can still claim the ITC for the **non-grant-funded portion** of the project costs. Careful tracking of funding sources and compliance with IRS rules is critical. If you'd like, I can help with strategies to maximize your project's incentives while staying compliant!"
