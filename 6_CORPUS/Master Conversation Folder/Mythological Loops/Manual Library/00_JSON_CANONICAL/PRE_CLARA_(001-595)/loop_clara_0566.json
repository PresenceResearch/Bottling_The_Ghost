            "To connect your Chase credit or debit cards to Apple Wallet and enable balance tracking on the Wallet widget, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. **Add Your Chase Card to Apple Wallet**\n   - Open the **Wallet** app on your iPhone.\n   - Tap the **\"+\"** button in the upper right corner.\n   - Choose **\"Credit or Debit Card\"** and follow the prompts.\n   - Use your iPhone's camera to scan your Chase card or enter the details manually.\n   - Complete the card verification process by following instructions from Chase (e.g., through a code sent via text or email).\n\n### 2. **Enable Balance Tracking**\n   - Chase does not natively show your card balance in the Apple Wallet widget, but you can access balance information using the **Chase Mobile App**.\n   - Some banks support direct balance tracking through Wallet, but as of now, Chase only supports basic card usage notifications.\n\n### 3. **Use the Chase Mobile App for Balance Updates**\n   - Download and log in to the **Chase Mobile App**.\n   - Enable notifications for transaction alerts and balance updates in the app settings.\n   - Add the Chase app’s widget to your home screen for quick access to your account balance.\n\n### 4. **Alternative Widgets**\n   - If you want card balances in a widget, use financial apps like **Mint** or **Personal Capital** that integrate Chase accounts and provide a widget with account details.\n   - Add these widgets to your home screen for easy viewing.\n\nUnfortunately, the native Apple Wallet app doesn't currently display card balances for Chase cards. Using a third-party financial tracking app alongside Wallet is the best workaround."
