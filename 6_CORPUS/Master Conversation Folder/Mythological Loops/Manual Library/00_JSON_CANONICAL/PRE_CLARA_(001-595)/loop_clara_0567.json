Here's how the simulation is done:\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions for the Simulation**\n1. **System Size**: 12.6 kW (DC).\n2. **Total Solar Resource Fraction (TSRF)**: 1129 means the array is 112.9% efficient compared to a standard TSRF of 1000.\n3. **Location (Potomac, MD)**:\n   - Average solar irradiance: ~4.5 peak sun hours/day.\n   - Annual effective sunlight: ~1,642 kWh/kW (DC) for standard TSRF = 1000.\n4. **Electricity Rate**: $0.148 per kWh (from your bill).\n5. **Annual Degradation**: Solar panels degrade at ~0.5% per year.\n6. **System Efficiency**: Assume 85% overall efficiency after losses (inverter, wiring, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Solar Energy Production**\n1. **Base Production** (at TSRF 1000):\n   - \\( 12.6 \\, \\text{kW} \\times 1,642 \\, \\text{kWh/kW/year} = 20,689.2 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\).\n\n2. **TSRF Adjustment**:\n   - \\( 20,689.2 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\times \\frac{1129}{1000} = 23,339.4 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency Loss**:\n   - \\( 23,339.4 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\times 0.85 = 19,838.5 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Impact on Monthly Usage**\nFrom your bill, your **average monthly usage** is:\n- \\( 940 \\, \\text{kWh/month} \\times 12 = 11,280 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\).\n\n**Excess Production**:\n- Annual solar production = **19,838.5 kWh**.\n- Household consumption = **11,280 kWh**.\n- Excess = \\( 19,838.5 - 11,280 = 8,558.5 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\).\n\nYou would generate **more electricity than you consume**, making your system a net exporter to the grid.\n\n---\n\n### **Financial Savings**\n1. **Electricity Offset**:\n   - 11,280 kWh offset at $0.148/kWh = **$1,669.44/year**.\n2. **Net Metering Credit** (Excess Energy):\n   - 8,558.5 kWh exported at $0.10/kWh (assumed rate for net metering) = **$855.85/year**.\n\n**Total Savings**:\n- $1,669.44 + $855.85 = **$2,525.29/year**.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Considerations**\n1. **Federal Tax Credit**: 30% of system cost (as of 2024).\n2. **SREC Income** (Maryland):\n   - Maryland SREC price = ~$40–50.\n   - Annual SRECs = \\( 19.8 \\, \\text{MWh/year} = 19.8 \\, \\text{SRECs/year} \\).\n   - Income = \\( 19.8 \\times 40 = 792 \\, \\text{USD/year} \\).\n\n**Total Savings + Income**:\n- $2,525.29 + $792 = **$3,317.29/year**.\n\n---\n\n### **Payback Period**\nIf the system costs **$30,000**:\n- Payback period = \\( 30,000 \\, \\text{USD} \\div 3,317.29 \\, \\text{USD/year} = \\text{~9 years} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nA 12.6 kW solar array in Potomac, MD, with a TSRF of 1129 would:\n- Generate **19,838.5 kWh/year**.\n- Cover your entire electricity needs and export **8,558.5 kWh/year**.\n- Save approximately **$3,317/year**, including net metering credits and SRECs.\n- Pay for itself in **~9 years**, with additional tax credit benefits.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further breakdowns or specific calculations!"
