            "In the Washington, D.C. SREC market, long-term contracts offer solar system owners predictable revenue streams by locking in SREC prices over extended periods. These contracts can mitigate the risks associated with market volatility and provide financial stability.\n\n**Contract Options**\n\nSeveral firms facilitate long-term SREC contracts in Washington, D.C., each offering distinct terms:\n\n- **Sol Systems**: As of January 2025, Sol Systems provides:\n  - **Sol Upfront**: A one-time payment of $1,520 per kW for 15 years of SREC production.\n  - **Sol Annuity**: A guaranteed rate of $373 per SREC for a 3-year term.\n  - **Sol Brokerage**: A variable-rate option at $429.25 per SREC, reflecting current market prices minus a brokerage fee. citeturn0search2\n\n- **Flett Exchange**: Specializes in brokering long-term SREC contracts, typically ranging from 1 to 3 years. They execute over-the-counter agreements for larger sellers directly with energy companies and transact directly with medium-sized sellers. citeturn0search0\n\n**Benefits of Long-Term Contracts**\n\n- **Revenue Predictability**: Fixed rates ensure consistent income, aiding in financial planning and budgeting.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Shield against potential declines in SREC market prices.\n- **Simplified Management**: Reduces the need for continuous market monitoring and timing sales for optimal returns.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nWhile long-term contracts provide stability, they may offer lower rates compared to current spot market prices. For instance, as of January 2025, spot market prices in Washington, D.C., are approximately $410 per SREC. citeturn0search5 Therefore, it's essential to weigh the security of fixed rates against the potential for higher, albeit variable, spot market returns.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nThe Washington, D.C. SREC market is influenced by factors such as the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) schedule and Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. Recent legislative changes have adjusted these parameters to promote market stability and investor confidence. citeturn0search8\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLong-term SREC contracts in Washington, D.C., offer a viable option for solar system owners seeking financial predictability and reduced exposure to market fluctuations. However, it's crucial to assess individual financial goals and risk tolerance when deciding between long-term contracts and spot market sales.\n\nFor personalized advice, consider consulting with SREC brokers or financial advisors experienced in the Washington, D.C. market. "
