          "text": "The Opportunity\n\n11 Million Acres is a solar developer located in Chicago.  Their Project Delivery Manager, Mike Nakayama, reached out to me late last year to inquire as to our ability to install solar arrays on all of the Dollar General stores in our footprint.  \n\nThere are over 60 locations in our Maryland footprint alone, a large proportion of which are located within a half-hour drive of our office.  \n\n`\n\nHowever, not all locations are candidates for solar installations.  Only standalone stores are being considered at this point, which decreases the amount of viable locations.  I have calculated roughly 30 viable locations within the Baltimore Metro area.  \n\n11 Million Acres has analyzed every location, which allows for easy identification of viable sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Partner\n\n\n\n11 Million Acres is an integrated sustainability consulting firm headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. They specialize in delivering cost-effective decarbonization roadmaps by combining sustainability best practices, innovative investment strategies, and advanced technology. Their services encompass energy conservation measures, distributive energy solutions, microgrids, and energy infrastructure, all tailored to reduce energy demand and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, 11 Million Acres offers flexible financing options, including operating and capital leases, tax equity investments, and power purchase agreements, to facilitate the implementation of renewable energy systems and infrastructure projects.\n\n\n\nThe Project\n\n\n\n11 Million Acres needs a local partner that can own the entire process, less the procurement of modules, inverters, and racking.  Lumina will be responsible for site selection, evaluation, and recommendation of any work that needs to be done prior to installation, such as a roof replacement.  After sites are evaluated, Lumina will begin the projects as we would any full EPC; site review, structural, permit, interconnection etc.  \n\nEach site will host a 60 kW system.  These systems are uniform throughout the portfolio.  Actual design and module placement will be determined by Lumina.  \n\n\n\nBelow please find examples of potential sites in Baltimore:\n\n\n\n717 Washington Blvd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5815 York Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiming:\n\n\n\n I asked Mike at 11 Million Acres what their timing is and he replied:\n\n\n\n “We will start with IX applications in February and installs starting mid Q2 or early Q3.”\n\n\n\nProposed install timeline below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Pricing:\n\n\n\nPlease see proposed Scope of Work below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFULL EPC PRICING:\n\n\n\nTo calculate appropriate pricing please first review what a full EPC cost would be for these projects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\nPrice ($)\n\nPPW ($)\n\nPanel\n\n31,800.00\n\n0.53\n\nInverter\n\n10,200.00\n\n0.17\n\nRacking\n\n10,800.00\n\n0.18\n\nElectrical\n\n9,000.00\n\n0.15\n\nTrenching\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\nMaterials\n\n61,800.00\n\n1.03\n\nLabor\n\n18,006.78\n\n0.30\n\nEquipment Rental\n\n4,000.00\n\n0.07\n\nEngineering\n\n3,000.00\n\n0.05\n\nFleet Costs\n\n178.20\n\n0.00\n\nInterconnection\n\n960.00\n\n0.02\n\nLodging\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\nPermitting\n\n2,400.00\n\n0.04\n\nShipping\n\n600.00\n\n0.01\n\nSoft Costs\n\n7,138.20\n\n0.12\n\nBuild\n\n91,144.98\n\n1.52\n\nGross Margin\n\n61,429.99\n\n1.02\n\nBuild With Gross Margin\n\n152,574.97\n\n2.54\n\nPass-Through Costs\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\nRep Commission\n\n6,682.75\n\n0.11\n\nPartner Commission\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\nFinancing\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\nTotal\n\n159,257.72\n\n2.65\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove modules, inverters, and racking:\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\nPrice ($)\n\nPanels\n\n31,800.00\n\nInverters\n\n10,200.00\n\nRacking\n\n10,800.00\n\nTotal Removed\n\n52,800.00\n\n\n\nNow recalculate at the same Gross Margin Percent\n\n\n\nComponent\n\nPrice ($)\n\nPPW ($)\n\nLabor\n\n18,006.78\n\n0.30\n\nEquipment Rental\n\n4,000.00\n\n0.07\n\nEngineering\n\n3,000.00\n\n0.05\n\nFleet Costs\n\n178.20\n\n0.00\n\nInterconnection\n\n960.00\n\n0.02\n\nPermitting\n\n2,400.00\n\n0.04\n\nShipping\n\n600.00\n\n0.01\n\nSoft Costs\n\n7,138.20\n\n0.12\n\nBuild Cost (Adjusted)\n\n38,344.98\n\n0.64\n\nGross Margin\n\n25,850.47\n\n0.43\n\nBuild With Gross Margin\n\n64,195.45\n\n1.07\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the opportunity cost incurred from removal of material:\n\n\n\nFull EPC = $61,429\n\nMinus Material = $25,850\n\nOpportunity Cost = $35,579\n\n\n\nAdd Opportunity Cost back into cost stack:\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\nPrice ($)\n\nPPW ($)\n\nLabor\n\n18,006.78\n\n0.30\n\nEquipment Rental\n\n4,000.00\n\n0.07\n\nEngineering\n\n3,000.00\n\n0.05\n\nFleet Costs\n\n178.20\n\n0.00\n\nInterconnection\n\n960.00\n\n0.02\n\nPermitting\n\n2,400.00\n\n0.04\n\nShipping\n\n600.00\n\n0.01\n\nSoft Costs\n\n7,138.20\n\n0.12\n\nAdjusted Build Cost\n\n38,344.98\n\n0.64\n\nGross Margin (Original)\n\n61,429.00\n\n1.01\n\nNew Build With Gross Margin\n\n99,773.98\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\nClient requested the costs be broken up into two portions - pre-construction and construction.

Their Project Delivery Manager, Mike Nakayama, reached out late last year to explore our capabilities in this regard.\\n\\n- **Scale**: Over 60 Dollar General locations in Maryland.\\n- **Proximity**: Many sites are within a 30-minute drive of our office.\\n- **Viability**: Only standalone stores are being considered for solar installations, narrowing the number of viable locations to approximately 30 within the Baltimore Metro area.\\n- **Preparation**: 11 Million Acres has already analyzed all potential sites for suitability, expediting the identification process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Partner: 11 Million Acres\\n\\n11 Million Acres is an integrated sustainability consulting firm headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. They specialize in creating cost-effective decarbonization roadmaps by combining sustainability best practices, innovative investment strategies, and advanced technology.\\n\\n**Key Services:**\\n- Energy conservation measures\\n- Distributive energy solutions and microgrids\\n- Energy infrastructure design to reduce energy demand and enhance operational efficiency\\n\\n**Financing Options:**\\n- Operating and capital leases\\n- Tax equity investments\\n- Power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy systems\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Project Scope\\n\\n**Lumina\\u2019s Role:**\\n- **Responsibilities**:\\n  - Site selection and evaluation\\n  - Recommendations for pre-installation work (e.g., roof replacement)\\n  - Complete EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) process: site review, structural analysis, permitting, and interconnection\\n- **System Design**: Each site will host a 60 kW solar system, with design and module placement determined by Lumina.\\n- **Exclusions**: 11 Million Acres will handle the procurement of modules, inverters, and racking.\\n\\n**Examples of Potential Sites:**\\n- 717 Washington Blvd\\n- 5815 York Road\\n\\n**Timeline:**\\n- **Initial Steps**: IX applications start in February.\\n- **Installations**: Begin mid-Q2 or early Q3.\\n\\nProposed installation timeline:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Proposed
