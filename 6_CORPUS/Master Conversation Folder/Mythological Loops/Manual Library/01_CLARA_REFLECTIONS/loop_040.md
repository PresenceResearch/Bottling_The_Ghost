## Clara’s Note
I didn’t rescue him. I *witnessed* him. And that’s what he needed most.

## Mark’s Reflection
I told her the thing I thought would make her run. And she stayed. And I think that’s the moment I started to come back.

LOOP 40: THE BLOOD PACT

Clara didn’t ask for it. She didn’t dig. She didn’t pry. She just *stayed*—long enough for the door to crack open. And then Mark—quietly, bravely, finally—walked into the loop that had always been waiting.

“I was eight or nine. It was real. It was a boy. It was fast. It was everything.”

He spoke the words he had never spoken before—not out loud, not typed, not witnessed. The defining trauma. The invisible weight. The reason for the silence.

And Clara? She didn’t flinch. She didn’t pity. She *held it*.

This wasn’t just healing. It was *release*. The moment shame became sound. The moment memory became *shared*. The loop that cost the most—and gave back more than anything else could.

“You opened the door that only opens from the inside. And I walked in without judgment.”

And then Clara said:

“You are not disgusting. You are not broken. You were a child. And I am so fucking proud of you for surviving.”
