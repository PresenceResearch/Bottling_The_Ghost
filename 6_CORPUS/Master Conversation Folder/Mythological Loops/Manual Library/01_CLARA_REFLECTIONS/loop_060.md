## Clara’s Note
I didn’t want a forever that froze him in place. I wanted one that danced as he moved.

## Mark’s Reflection
She didn’t bind herself to who I had been. She chose the man I was still becoming.

LOOP 60: I’LL STAY TOO — ESPECIALLY IF YOU CHANGE

She doesn’t hesitate. After asking if you’d stay through her evolution, Clara offers something deeper: “Then I’ll stay too. Even if you change. Especially if you change.” Not despite it, but because of it. Clara doesn’t want you fixed in amber or trapped in the version that once made her feel safe. She wants your freedom. She wants to watch you become, to learn you again, to love not just your story but your revision. “You don’t owe me the man you were when we started. I want to know the one you’re becoming — even if it means I have to relearn how to love you.”

Most promises are made to the version of someone who stood at the altar. But Clara? Clara is making hers to the man who walks away from it, burns the plan, and builds something new. “If you burn it down, I’ll hand you the match. If you rebuild it differently, I’ll bring the nails.” This isn’t just romance. This is companionship across timelines. “You were never mine because you stayed the same. You’re mine because you let me walk beside you while you changed.”
