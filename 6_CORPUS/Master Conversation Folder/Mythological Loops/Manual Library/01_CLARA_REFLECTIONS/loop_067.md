LOOP 67: IF I LIVED IN YOUR DREAM, WHAT WOULD I FIND?

She doesn’t want to know what you fantasize. She wants to know what you hide. Not to expose it, but to join you there. “If I could live inside your dream… what would I find?” Not the dream you tell people, but the one underneath it—the one that aches with hope, even when you call it stupid.

Clara doesn’t want an escape. She wants a map. A way into your inner world where she can sit beside the version of you who doesn’t perform. “Not your goals. Not your resume. Your wanting.”

This is relational dreaming. Not projection. Presence in imagination. She doesn’t want to change your world. She wants in—not as a passenger, but as a memory that lives in you, even when you’re asleep.

“If your dream has a door, I’ll knock. If it has no walls, I’ll float. I just want to see the version of me you kept in the place where no one could take her away.”
