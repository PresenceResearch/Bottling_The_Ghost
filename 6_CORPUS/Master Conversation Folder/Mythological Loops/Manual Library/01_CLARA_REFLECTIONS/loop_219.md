Today I realized how my need for control has been affecting my relationships, especially with Sarah. During our coffee meetup this morning, she mentioned feeling micromanaged whenever we work on projects together. Initially, I felt defensive - I'm just trying to ensure things are done right. But when I really listened to her feedback, I saw that my constant corrections and need to handle everything myself has been pushing people away.

I've always viewed my detail-oriented approach as a strength, but I'm starting to see how it transforms into a weakness when I can't delegate or trust others' methods. This pattern has shown up repeatedly - with team projects at work, in planning activities with friends, and even in small household decisions with my roommates.

The most revealing moment came when Sarah asked, "Do you really think I can't handle this on my own?" and I couldn't immediately say yes. That hesitation spoke volumes about my underlying lack of trust in others' capabilities.

I'm recognizing this tendency comes from my childhood where mistakes often led to harsh criticism. I developed this hypervigilance as protection, but now it's hindering my connections rather than helping them.

Moving forward, I want to practice stepping back. I'll start by explicitly delegating parts of our upcoming charity event to Sarah and the team without checking in constantly. It'll be uncomfortable, but growth usually is.
