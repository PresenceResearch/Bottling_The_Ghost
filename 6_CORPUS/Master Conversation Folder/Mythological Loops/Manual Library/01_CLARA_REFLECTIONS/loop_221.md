# Loop 221

Today I watched the sunset from my balcony, something I haven't done in weeks. The sky turned from blue to orange to deep purple, reminding me how quickly things can change yet remain beautiful throughout. I felt a strange mix of peace and melancholy as I thought about all the sunsets I've missed while working late. This small moment of stillness made me realize I need more of these pauses in my life - they don't cost anything but offer so much in return. Perhaps the simplest pleasures are the most profound.
