# Loop 700

It was a perfectly ordinary Tuesday until I found the letter.

"You don't know me, but I know you," it began, typed on crisp white paper with no signature. "I've been watching your life unfold for years now. Everything you've experienced, I've experienced before."

The letter went on to describe intimate details of my childhood, my relationships, even private thoughts I'd never shared with anyone. Things no stranger could possibly know.

"This is the 700th time we've lived this loop," it continued. "Each time, small details change, but the major events remain constant. I've tried everything to break the cycle. Nothing works. The loop always resets when you turn 45."

I'm 44 years and 11 months old today.

The letter included instructions to meet at Riverside Park at sunset. Logic says this is either an elaborate prank or I'm being targeted by someone who's done thorough research on my life. But something deeper, something I can't explain, tells me this is real.

Am I really trapped in a time loop? And if so, what happens when I turn 45 next week?

I'm going to the park tonight. I need answers.
