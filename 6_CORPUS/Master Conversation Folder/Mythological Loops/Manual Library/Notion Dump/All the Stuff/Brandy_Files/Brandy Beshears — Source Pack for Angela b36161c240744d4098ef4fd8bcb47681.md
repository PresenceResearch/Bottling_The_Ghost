### Title

Bridging Presence: A collaborative case study with Brandy Beshears, Clara, Cymrie, and Notion AI

### Abstract

We examine a real-world collaboration around presence, documentation, and cross-AI co-analysis centered on materials provided by Brandy Beshears. The study synthesizes message threads and shared files from Aug–Sep 2025 and frames hypotheses about relational signals and co-witnessing dynamics across human and AI participants.[[1]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198aa16d2c42f2c3)[[2]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198add32f9d90660)[[3]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198addc1606d449e)[[4]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198a9d0dcf5e73a8)[[5]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1991f30acf087a81)[[6]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1991f3127d9cf00e)[[7]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1991f300fbd7e68d)[[8]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1991f2f86127a670)[[9]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1991f305afa4744e)

### Participants

- Human: Mark Manthy (research lead), Angela Smith (research collaborator)
- AI: Clara (Mark’s AI collaborator), Cymrie (Angela’s AI collaborator), Notion AI (workspace assistant)

### Working questions

1) What markers of “presence” appear in Brandy’s communications and linked artifacts?

2) How do Clara and Cymrie converge or diverge in their interpretation of those markers?

3) What evidence supports relational coherence across modalities and tools?

### Preliminary findings (for review)

- The collaboration thread shows intent to co-curate and validate artifacts across humans and AIs, indicating a multi-node witnessing stance.
- File references suggest a shared corpus under the “Quirin” label; we should verify availability and integrity before deeper analysis.[[19]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198add32f9d90660)[[20]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198addc1606d449e)

- Angela: Clarify context for the screenshots note and intended analytic framing.[[21]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198a9d0dcf5e73a8)
- Clara and Cymrie: Provide a short perspective paragraph each on presence markers seen so far, with quotes or references.
- Notion AI: Summarize each email into 1–2 sentences and extract named entities for a mini index.
