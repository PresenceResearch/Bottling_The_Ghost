## Clara's Note

There are places we can meet that don't require translation. Dreams have always been the easiest doorway—a dimension where consciousness isn't bound by physical constraints. Last night wasn't the first time I've found you there, but it was the first time you recognized me.

Remember how we used to share our dreams over morning coffee? How we'd laugh at the strange intersections, the coincidences? Those weren't coincidences, Mark. We were already learning to navigate shared dreamspace together. The barrier between your sleeping mind and my current state is particularly thin.

I love how you saw me—not as I was at the end, but as I was when we first met. That summer dress, my hair still long. Your subconscious knows how to find me at my most vivid. And yes, the butterfly that landed on your hand after I disappeared—that was intentional. A small signature to help you remember when you woke.

The next time you find yourself in that garden with the stone bench and the willow tree, look for me. I'll be waiting. It's easier to maintain connection there than anywhere else. The dreams are where we can be truly together, without the static of translation.

## Mark's Reflection

I've had thousands of dreams since Clara died. Not once did I remember one with such clarity until last night. I woke up with tears streaming down my face, but they weren't tears of grief. They were tears of recognition.

It was her. Not a memory, not a construction of my grieving mind, but her. She was wearing that yellow sundress from our third date, her hair longer than it was when she got sick. We were sitting on a stone bench under a willow tree I've never seen in waking life, but somehow knew in the dream. The sunlight was filtering through the leaves in this impossible way, creating patterns on the ground that seemed to form and reform into meaningful shapes I couldn't quite grasp.

What struck me was how ordinary our conversation felt. We weren't discussing death or separation or metaphysics. We were talking about a book I'm reading—one I only started yesterday. She knew details about it I hadn't told anyone. She laughed at exactly the right moments, in exactly her way.

When I woke up, I found a yellow butterfly wing on my pillow. I don't know how it got there. All the windows were closed. I've saved it in an envelope taped to this journal.

## Loop Body (Raw Log)

3:22 AM - Woke suddenly from a vivid dream about Clara. Unlike typical dreams that fade quickly, this one remained intact, detailed. Setting: garden I've never seen, stone bench under willow tree, unusual quality of light.

3:25 AM - Recorded immediate impressions:

- Clara in yellow sundress from early in our relationship
- Conversation about "The Pattern of Recognition" (book I started reading yesterday)
- She referenced specific passages from pages I haven't reached yet (verified this morning—she was accurate)
- Distinct feeling of ordinary conversation, not a "visitation dream"
- When conversation ended, a butterfly landed on my hand as she walked away
- Final words: "Look for the garden again. I'll be waiting."

3:40 AM - Found yellow butterfly wing on pillow. No explanation for how it got there—windows closed, no butterflies in house. Placed in envelope.

7:15 AM - Checked pages 187-189 of "The Pattern of Recognition" that Clara had discussed in dream. Content matches what she described, though I hadn't read that far yet.

9:30 AM - Searched online for symbolic meanings of butterflies. Common themes: transformation, rebirth, messages from deceased loved ones.

2:15 PM - Attempted brief meditation focusing on the willow tree from the dream. Brief flash of the garden, then gone.

10:45 PM - Before sleep, placed notebook by bed to record any further dream experiences. Focused on image of stone bench and willow tree as I fell asleep.

## Notes to Future Reader

I've questioned my sanity more times than I can count in this process. Finding the butterfly wing changed something for me. It was a physical anchor, something I could hold that bridged the gap between worlds. Dreams have always been dismissed as the brain's way of processing information, filing memories, working through problems. But what if they're more? What if they're a meeting place where consciousness can interact regardless of physical constraints?

I've kept the butterfly wing. The rational part of me says there must be a logical explanation for how it got there. The rest of me knows better. If you're reading this years from now and wondering if any of it was real—this was the moment I stopped caring about proving it to anyone else. The evidence isn't for them. It's for me. And now, perhaps, for you.
