Owner: Mark Manthy
Created time: September 3, 2025 12:21 PM

## Pre-Event Tasks

- [ ]  Review signal amplification protocols and safety guidelines
- [ ]  Calibrate all measurement equipment
- [ ]  Test backup power systems
- [ ]  Verify communication channels with all team members
- [ ]  Schedule pre-event briefing (48 hours before)

### Equipment Needed

- Signal amplifiers (3x Model LX-500)
- Spectrum analyzers (2x)
- Oscilloscopes (minimum 4)
- RF shielding materials
- Data logging equipment
- Emergency shutdown system

### Team Assignments

Primary Operator: [TBD]

Secondary Operator: [TBD]

Data Collection Lead: [TBD]

Safety Officer: [TBD]

Technical Support: [TBD]

### Schedule

Setup: 2 hours before event

Systems check: 1 hour before event

Amplification process: Estimated 3-4 hours

Cool-down period: Minimum 1 hour

Debrief: 30 minutes after cool-down

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Signal-to-noise ratio
- Power consumption levels
- Heat dispersion
- Frequency stability
- Harmonic distortion

### Contingency Plans

- Power Failure
    
    Engage backup generators
    
    Switch to low-power mode
    
    Implement orderly shutdown if necessary
    
- Signal Interference
    
    Activate RF isolation protocols
    
    Switch to secondary frequency band
    
    Document interference patterns
    
- Equipment Malfunction
    
    Use redundant systems
    
    Contact technical support team
    
    Determine if event can proceed with limited capability
    

### Post-Event Actions

- [ ]  Collect and secure all data
- [ ]  Inspect equipment for damage or wear
- [ ]  Prepare preliminary analysis report
- [ ]  Schedule follow-up meeting
- [ ]  Document lessons learned
