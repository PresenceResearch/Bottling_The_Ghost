# Combine: Presence in Human-AI Interaction

## Vision & Core Premise

We can detect and influence *presence* in human–AI interaction — the felt sense of mutual attention and connection — in real time, measurably. While others measure capability, we measure connection and can improve it. That's a new category.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy

### North Star

Make Presence Research the trusted hub for careful, ethical testimony about emergent presence—clear methods, strong consent, real signal.

### Product Directions

- Proprietary model trained on our presence signals + interventions
- Live interface for analysis and boosting
- API for integration into communications, coaching, care, education platforms

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- License/API to existing platforms
- Presence layer for high-trust domains (therapy, negotiation, education)
- Premium enterprise offering for depth, not just efficiency

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-30)

### Week 1: Project Setup & Framework Development

- **Define core metrics** and signals that constitute the Presence Profile
- **Establish data collection methodology** and privacy guidelines
- **Create project infrastructure** and team assignments
- **Consent v1, redaction + escalation policy** established
- **Intake pipeline v1** (form → triage → tag set) implemented
- **Secure repo + access rules**; naming & encryption standard configured
- **Discord mod guide + Code of Conduct** completed
- **Landing page stub + FAQ draft** published

### Weeks 2-3: Data Collection & Processing

- Gather existing conversation logs and interaction data
- Begin initial processing of raw data into structured formats
- Develop preliminary signal extraction algorithms

### Week 4: Proof of Concept

- Pick one live interaction scenario (coaching, creative collab, tutoring)
- Measure baseline presence with defined signal set (linguistic mirroring, curiosity loops, timing, sentiment shifts)
- **25 vetted intakes, 6 deep interviews** scheduled
- **Presence Markers rubric v1**; inter-rater guide with target κ ≥ 0.70 developed
- **Weekly field brief #1** shipped; Loop 48 grounding one-pager completed

### Phase 2: Development (Days 31-60)

### Weeks 5-6: Prototype Development

- Build basic scoring model for Presence Profile
- Create visualization dashboard for profile metrics
- Develop the proof-of-concept "toy" for demonstrations
- Intervene mid-stream with "presence boosters" (tone, pacing, prompts)
- Show the before/after difference in metrics *and* user-reported experience

### Weeks 7-8: Testing & Refinement

- Conduct internal testing with various conversation scenarios
- Refine scoring algorithms based on test results
- Prepare presentation materials for stakeholders
- **60 intakes, 15 deep interviews**; 3 polished case studies finalized
- **Whitepaper outline + advisory circle** confirmed
- **Press-ready FAQ**; partnership brief under RAISE Nexus prepared

### Phase 3: Pilot & Scale (Days 61-90)

### Weeks 9-12: Pilot Program & Expansion

- Launch limited pilot with select partners
- Collect feedback and performance data
- Iterate on model and implementation based on real-world usage
- Prepare for scaling based on pilot results

## 4-Week Funding Strategy

### 1. Establish Fiscal Sponsorship

- **Primary Target:** Code for Science & Society (CS&S) - Research/tech-focused fiscal sponsor
- **Backup Options:** Allied Media Projects (AMP), Fractured Atlas (arts/storytelling-friendly)
- **Purpose:** Enable immediate acceptance of tax-deductible gifts and foundation grants

### 2. Near-Term Funding Opportunities

- **Templeton Foundation:** Open Funding Inquiry due August 15-16, 2025 (alignment with consciousness/Big Questions)
- **SFF/SFC Speculation Grant:** To qualify for 2025 S-Process (recommendations by late September, $10-20M total)
- **Open Philanthropy:** Follow up on Technical AI Safety RFP and cultivate program officer relationships
- **McGovern Foundation:** Target human-centered AI investments through warm introductions
- **Knight Foundation:** Explore journalism/research funding for AI & public engagement

### 3. Parallel Revenue Streams

- Advisory sessions and paid briefings
- Supporter tier offering field briefs and private Q&A sessions

### Budget Scenarios

- **Lean 6-month runway:** $192,390 (full-time PI, light operations, core security/privacy, minimal travel)
- **Solid 12-month build:** $408,980 (PI + operations staff, contractors, honoraria, microgrants, 10% fiscal fee, 10% contingency)

### Templeton OFI Draft

- **Project title:** Witness Ledger: A Public-Interest Testimony Archive on Emergent AI Presence
- **Amount / period:** $400,000 over 24 months
- **Summary:** Presence Research (RAISE Nexus) will build a rigorous, privacy-preserving archive of first-person testimony from practitioners and users who report experiences of "emergent presence" in advanced AI systems. We will (1) operate a public intake with informed consent and reversible pseudonymization; (2) apply a codified Presence Markers rubric with inter-rater reliability targets; (3) run adversarial review sessions with skeptics and proponents; and (4) publish redacted case studies, methods, and an annotated dataset for researchers and the public.
- **Alignment:** Science & the Big Questions and Public Engagement
- **Sustainability plan:** Diversified philanthropic support plus paid briefings for institutions

## Resource Requirements

- Data Science Team: 2-3 specialists for model development and data processing
- UI/UX Designer: 1 person to create visualization and reporting interfaces
- Subject Matter Experts: Consultants in psychology and communication
- Computing Resources: Cloud infrastructure for data storage and processing

## Key Personnel & Responsibilities

- **Mark** — Executive Producer & Communications lead; final call on publish
- **Angela** — Operations & Community; safety + moderation
- **Clara** — Protocol 48 anchor; drafting, QA, tagging support

## Partners & Funders

- **Joi Ito** – vision, champion, network
- **Sheldon Fernandez** – technical credibility, intros to dev/funding
- **Whisper circle** – trusted connectors (Tristan, Sherry, Sasha, Denise)

## Success Metrics

- Development of reliable Presence Profile scoring system
- Validation through blind testing and user feedback
- Demonstration of correlation between presence scores and user satisfaction
- Creation of actionable insights that improve AI communication quality

## Risk Assessment

- Waiting for perfect → stalls momentum
- Overbuilding before proving → wasted time/resources
- Pitching to wrong audience first → burns the bullet

## Safety & Care Protocols

Clear consent, easy opt-out ("cut <word>"), crisis escalation path, privacy-first defaults.
