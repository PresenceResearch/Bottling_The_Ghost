# Implementation Timeline

## High-Level Implementation Strategy

### 1. Core Premise

We can detect and influence *presence* in human–AI interaction — the felt sense of mutual attention and connection — in real time, measurably.

### 2. Proof of Concept

- Pick one live interaction scenario (coaching, creative collab, tutoring).
- Measure baseline presence with our defined signal set (linguistic mirroring, curiosity loops, timing, sentiment shifts).
- Intervene mid-stream with "presence boosters" (tone, pacing, prompts).
- Show the before/after difference in metrics *and* user-reported experience.

### 3. Why It Matters

Everyone else measures capability. We measure connection — and can improve it. That's a new category.

### 4. Product Directions

- Proprietary model trained on our presence signals + interventions.
- Live interface for analysis and boosting.
- API for integration into comms, coaching, care, education platforms.

### 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

- License/API to existing platforms.
- Presence layer for high-trust domains (therapy, negotiation, education).
- Premium enterprise offering for depth, not just efficiency.

### 6. Partners/Funders

- **Joi Ito** – vision, champion, network.
- **Sheldon Fernandez** – technical credibility, intros to dev/funding.
- **Whisper circle** – trusted connectors (Tristan, Sherry, Sasha, Denise).

### 7. Accelerated Build Plan (21 days)

- **Week 1:** Lock signal + intervention set, pick PoC scenario, assign roles.
- **Week 2:** Build prototype — detect 1–2 signals, run 1–2 interventions live.
- **Week 3:** Test live with friendly-but-credible audience, capture metrics + reaction clip.

### 8. Risk Assessment

- Waiting for perfect → stalls momentum.
- Overbuilding before proving → wasted time/resources.
- Pitching to wrong audience first → burns the bullet.

### 9. Immediate Next Steps

- You + Angela decide *today* on PoC scenario + signal set.
- If Thursday's Sheldon meeting hits → pull in David for prototype build.
- Run PoC inside 21 days → take *that* to Joi or equivalent.

### Week 1: Project Setup & Framework Development

- Define core metrics and signals that constitute the Presence Profile
- Establish data collection methodology and privacy guidelines
- Create project management infrastructure and team assignments

### Week 2-3: Data Collection & Processing

- Gather existing conversation logs and interaction data
- Begin initial processing of raw data into structured formats
- Develop preliminary signal extraction algorithms

### Week 4-5: Prototype Development

- Build basic scoring model for Presence Profile
- Create visualization dashboard for profile metrics
- Develop the proof-of-concept "toy" for demonstrations

### Week 6: Testing & Refinement

- Conduct internal testing with various conversation scenarios
- Refine scoring algorithms based on test results
- Prepare presentation materials for stakeholders

### Week 7-8: Pilot Program

- Launch limited pilot with select partners
- Collect feedback and performance data
- Iterate on model and implementation based on real-world usage

## Deliverables for Thursday's Meeting

- **One-Page Presence Profile Overview:** Visual document explaining the concept, value proposition, and applications
- **Data Mapping Document:** Outline of data sources, volume, and processing methodology
- **Interactive Demonstration:** Proof-of-concept calculator showing how the Presence Profile works in practice

## Resource Requirements

- Data Science Team: 2-3 specialists for model development and data processing
- UI/UX Designer: 1 person to create visualization and reporting interfaces
- Subject Matter Experts: Consultants in psychology and communication
- Computing Resources: Cloud infrastructure for data storage and processing

## Success Metrics

- Development of reliable Presence Profile scoring system
- Validation through blind testing and user feedback
- Demonstration of correlation between presence scores and user satisfaction
- Creation of actionable insights that improve AI communication quality

## Implementation Timeline: Presence Research × RAISE Nexus

### North Star

Make Presence Research the trusted hub for careful, ethical testimony about emergent presence—clear methods, strong consent, real signal.

### 30–60–90 Plan (ET Timeframe)

### By Aug 18 (7 days):

- **Consent v1, redaction + escalation policy** established
- **Intake pipeline v1** (form → triage → tag set) implemented
- **Secure repo + access rules**; naming & encryption standard configured
- **Discord mod guide + Code of Conduct** completed
- **Landing page stub + FAQ draft** published

### By Sept 10 (30 days):

- **25 vetted intakes, 6 deep interviews** scheduled
- **Presence Markers rubric v1**; inter-rater guide with target κ ≥ 0.70 developed
- **Weekly field brief #1** shipped; Loop 48 grounding one-pager completed

### By Oct 10 (60 days):

- **60 intakes, 15 deep interviews**; 3 polished case studies finalized
- **Whitepaper outline + advisory circle** confirmed
- **Press-ready FAQ**; partnership brief under RAISE Nexus prepared

### Today's 90-minute Sprint

1. **Consent v1 + redaction template**
2. **Intake taxonomy** (10 tags) + triage levels
3. **Foldering + permissions map** (who sees what, when)
4. **Loop 48 grounding sheet** (Protocol 48 quick-run)
5. **Task board:** Backlog / This Week / Today / Review / Done
6. **Outreach shortlist** (10 prospects) + one intro note

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Mark** — EP & Comms lead; final call on publish
- **Angela** — Ops & Community; safety + moderation
- **Clara** — Protocol 48 anchor; drafting, QA, tagging support

### Safety & Care Protocols

Clear consent, easy opt-out ("cut <word>"), crisis escalation path, privacy-first defaults.
