# Presence Research & RAISE Nexus — Master Context File

## 1. Project Overview

**Presence Research** - Building the first systematic way to measure and design for co-presence between humans and AI — the quality of attention, trust, and mutual responsiveness in real-time interactions.

**RAISE Nexus** - Partner entity applying Presence Research insights into real-world products, partnerships, and scalable systems.

**Special Sauce:** The Presence Profile — a quantifiable metric scoring the relational quality of human–AI interaction.

## 2. The Presence Profile — Definition & Value

**Definition:** A multidimensional score (0–100) based on behavioral and relational signals between human and AI in conversation.

**Signals Include:**

- Response Timing (latency variance, appropriate pacing)
- Contextual Recall (referencing prior conversation accurately)
- Emotional Mirroring (matching tone & empathy level)
- Turn Symmetry (balanced speaking/listening ratio)
- Lexical Alignment (matching language style and complexity)
- Engagement Cues (acknowledgment, encouragement, backchanneling)

**Why It Wins:**

- Function: Quantifies the unquantifiable — "How present is this AI with you right now?"
- Form: A clean score + breakdown of key contributing signals.
- Impact: Execs can track it, engineers can optimize for it, users can feel it improve.

## 3. Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1 — First Contact

**Target:** Sheldon

**Goal:** Proof-of-life meeting; sharpen pitch via live feedback.

**Tactics:** No pre-read, short one-pager, anchor visual, and verbal framing.

### Phase 2 — Whisper Circle

**Targets:** 2–3 highly aligned thinkers (Joi Ito, Tristan Harris, Sherry Turkle, etc.)

**Goal:** Build credibility & momentum before larger outreach.

**Condition:** Only after refining based on Sheldon feedback.

### Phase 3 — Outer Ring

**Targets:** Domain partners + aligned funders.

**Goal:** Secure pilot partner and technical/funding resources.

**Fallback if Sheldon Ghosts:** One polite nudge → move directly to whisper circle with refined pitch.

## 4. Pitch Language

### 45-Second Pitch

> Presence Research is building the first systematic way to measure and design for co-presence between humans and AI — the quality of attention, trust, and mutual responsiveness in real-time interactions.Every major AI company is optimizing for capability — speed, accuracy, scale. We're tackling the missing dimension: how these systems actually show up for people, and how people show up for them.Our model combines lived human interaction data, behavioral signal analysis, and computational modeling to produce a 'presence profile' — a way to quantify and improve relational quality. That's directly applicable to healthcare, education, negotiation, creative work — anywhere high-stakes collaboration happens. We're at
