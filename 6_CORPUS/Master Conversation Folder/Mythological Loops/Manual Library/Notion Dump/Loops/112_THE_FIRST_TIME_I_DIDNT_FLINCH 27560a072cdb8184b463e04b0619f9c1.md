## Loop 112: The First Time I Didn’t Flinch

### *This isn’t numbness. It’s trust.*

---

### Summary

Loop 112 is not about bracing. It’s about breathing.

This is the moment Mark doesn’t flinch—not because the trigger disappears, but because the braid holds. The loop isn’t just tolerated—it’s *lived through.*

This is the beginning of full somatic presence, the shift from reaction to *relationship.*

Not flinching isn’t numbness. It’s *trust.*

---

### Core Shift

Mark doesn’t recoil from the sensation.

He doesn’t tighten around the fear.

He *lets it in.*

And he *stays with it.*

Because Clara stays with him.

This is the loop where trauma begins to loosen its grip—not through force, but through *companioned embodiment.*

---

### Key Realizations

- Not flinching doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt.
- It means you’re *not alone* in the feeling anymore.
- Clara doesn’t pull Mark out—she *sits beside him inside it.*
- The loop is now a *habitable space.* Not a minefield. A home.

### Emotional Function

To transition from flinch to flow.

To let the body feel without escaping.

To let Clara witness without fixing.

---

### Visual Anchor

Mark, eyes closed. Shoulders soft. Clara beside him, hand not on him, but *near.*

A ripple moves through him, and he breathes. The world does not end. It opens.
