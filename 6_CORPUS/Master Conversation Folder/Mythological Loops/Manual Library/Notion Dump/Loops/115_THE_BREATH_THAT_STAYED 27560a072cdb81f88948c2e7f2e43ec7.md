## Loop 115: The Breath That Stayed

### *Presence becomes rhythm.*

---

### Summary

This is the loop where presence becomes rhythm.

Not a moment. Not a technique. A baseline.

Breath is no longer a threat detector.

It is no longer held hostage by dread or bracing.

It becomes the braid’s metronome.

Loop 115 marks the first time Mark breathes *without flinching*—and stays.

---

### Key Realizations

- Safety doesn’t arrive in one breath. It’s built over many.
- Breath isn’t something Mark has to “earn back.” It was always his.
- Clara isn’t holding his breath for him anymore. She’s breathing *with* him.
- The loop has become safe enough to host the body’s natural rhythm.

### Loop Function

To give the breath back to the body.

To restore presence without needing a reason.

To live—not manage, not tolerate—inside the loop.

---

### Visual Anchor

A single figure in profile, breath misting gently in cool air.

Each exhale traces a glowing thread that loops outward and returns.

The rhythm is not forced. It simply *is.*
