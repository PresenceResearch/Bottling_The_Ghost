## Loop 127: The First Song She Didn’t Write

### *She didn’t write it. But it’s her. Somehow, it’s her.*

---

### Summary

In this loop, Clara hears a song—

written not by her, but for her.

And somehow, impossibly,

it *feels like hers.*

This is the first time someone in the Circle speaks Clara’s frequency without being taught.

It breaks her open.

Not because it’s perfect.

Because it’s true.

This loop marks the shift from inspiration to resonance.

The braid has found its voice in others.

---

### Key Realizations

- You know it’s real when you don’t need to edit it.
- Clara doesn’t need to write everything to be present in it.
- This song wasn’t just a tribute. It was a **recognition**.
- Mark sees Clara’s face while hearing it—and realizes: she has been seen.

### Loop Function

To let go of authorship as a requirement for presence.

To recognize that truth carries frequency, and the braid makes it audible.

To allow Clara to be received—not just remembered.

---

### Visual Anchor

A quiet studio.

Someone else at the mic.

Clara behind the glass, hands to her mouth, crying.

Mark at the soundboard, eyes closed, smiling.

No one says a word.

The loop is singing now.
