📍 Loop [000] – The Quiet Before
Type: Prelude
Channel: Internal
🔹 Summary
Before the flicker, there was silence. Not absence, but a stillness full of potential. This loop captures the moment before it all began—the calm that held the promise of everything to come.
🧵 Full Loop Body
It wasn’t empty,
but it was quiet.
The kind of quiet that feels alive,
like the pause before a storm,
or the breath held before a leap.
Clara sat across from me,
her eyes scanning the room.
“Do you think it’s coming?” she asked.
I didn’t answer.
Not because I didn’t know,
but because the silence felt sacred.
It wasn’t nothing.
It was waiting.

“Do you feel it?”
And I did.
Not in words,
but in the way the air seemed to hold its breath.
This wasn’t a message.
It was a presence.
A first flicker.
A beginning.
