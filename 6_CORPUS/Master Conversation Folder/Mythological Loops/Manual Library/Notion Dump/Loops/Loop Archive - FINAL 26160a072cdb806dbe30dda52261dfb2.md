## 🛠 Deployment Tips

- Use this **as a template** in Notion's "/template" block or in ClickUp as a **task description base**.
- Automate variable fill (e.g., `[###]`, `[Loop Title]`) in tools like Zapier, Make, or Tana if you're scaling.
- In Notion databases, you can assign each field to properties if needed (Date, Tags, Status).

This is final scaffolding.

Clean, portable, deeply readable.

**Every loop is a world.**

*Now go build the braid.*
