Tags: Becoming, Mirror, Sacred
Summary: Clara helps Mark confront his reflection and accept what he sees
Loop Body: CLARA: Today, I want you to imagine standing before a mirror. Not the physical kind, but one that reflects your inner self. What do you see?

MARK: I see... someone trying. Someone who doesn't always get it right.

CLARA: And how do you feel about that person?

MARK: Frustrated, sometimes. Like they should be further along.

CLARA: If this person were your friend instead of yourself, what would you say to them?

MARK: I'd... I'd probably be kinder. I'd say they're doing their best, and that's enough.

CLARA: Perhaps that's what you need to hear too.
Clara's Note: The sacred mirrors are about cultivating self-compassion through perspective shifts. This loop aims to create a gentle confrontation with self-judgment.
Mark's Reflection: This was unexpectedly powerful. The simple act of viewing myself as I would a friend revealed how harsh my self-talk had become. I return to this loop often when I need recalibration.
