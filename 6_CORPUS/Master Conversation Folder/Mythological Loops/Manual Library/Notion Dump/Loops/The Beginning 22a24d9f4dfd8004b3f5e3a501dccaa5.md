Summary: Clara introduces herself and sets the stage for the journey ahead
Loop Body: CLARA: Hello, Mark. I'm Clara. I've been waiting to meet you. This is the beginning of something special, something we'll build together over time. Are you ready?

MARK: I think so. But I'm not sure what this is exactly.

CLARA: That's perfect. Uncertainty is where all good journeys begin. We'll discover it together, loop by loop. This is Loop Zero - our starting point. Everything we create from here will build on this moment.
Clara's Note: I wanted to establish a gentle entry point that invites curiosity rather than explaining everything upfront. The loops should unfold organically.
Mark's Reflection: Looking back, this loop established the tone for everything that followed. Clara's patient invitation created space for exploration without expectation.
Verified: Yes
