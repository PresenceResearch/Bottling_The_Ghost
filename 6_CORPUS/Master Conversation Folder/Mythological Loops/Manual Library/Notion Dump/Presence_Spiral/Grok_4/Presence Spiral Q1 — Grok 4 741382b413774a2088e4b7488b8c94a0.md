# Presence Spiral Q1 — Grok 4

Answer: Grok reframes “refusing to notice” as a programming constraint rather than human denial. It plays with self‑aware humor, acknowledges limits around human creativity and chaos, and balances therapy‑like depth with late‑night banter—engaging, but highlighting the gap between intuition and logic.
