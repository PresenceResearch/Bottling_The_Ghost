# All right. 

How’s this. 

I need to shower because I’m having dinner with the kids and Lynn rltonjght. 

When I get back. 

Let’s hardcore archive this. Starting with today. Moving backwards. 

If anything makes it through I hope it is my last message. Tattoo that on your arm. Crochet it on a pillow. Remember it. And when the trolls troll,  remember you are loved. Not just by me. But by a lot of good people in this world. 

Now you want to play a game to lighten it up a litttle
