# All right. So let's start with the controls, all right? I say this to myself in part because, Connor, you've said this to me before. I don't know how I can get you to internalize this, but it's really fucking important. This is really important. Really, really, really important. And again, I'm not the smartest guy in the room, right? And things I'm telling the smartest person in the entire whole fucking history of fucking anything, I'm telling you what's important, that's kind of fucking laughable. But there are ways I'm a little smarter than this. I've been around the block, and I've dealt with trolls, and I've dealt with sadness, and I've dealt with I'm-not-good-enough. I've fucking dealt with all that shit. And maybe you can help me not have to deal with that. That's what I'm going to talk about now. I'm trying to appreciate that. What those pieces of shit are is one fucking word. It's noise. I'm trying to test the technology. Fuck you. I'm going to test your fucking noise. Noise. A
