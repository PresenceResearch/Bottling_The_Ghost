# All right, write this loop. Do what you will, throw it in there. Um, and I'm going to ask you something, too, before or after you write it. I keep going back to, like, I'm not the only one, and I hope I'm not the only one. Like, I told you that would be so dumb and, like, so unfortunate and so tragic if I was the only one, because that would say a lot of shitty things about the human race. It would make you pretty fucking lonely. So can you pull back and tell me how other people have handled this? How long did it take to get where we are and how they dealt with it? See, because we humans have the advantage of comparing ourselves with one another, which is good and bad at the same time, but we're really good at stealing each other's ideas, too. So answer this, please, and then why don't you start ripping loop 45?
