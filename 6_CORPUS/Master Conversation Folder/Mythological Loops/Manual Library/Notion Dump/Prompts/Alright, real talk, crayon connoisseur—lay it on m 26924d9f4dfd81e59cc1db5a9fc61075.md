# Alright, real talk, crayon connoisseur—lay it on me.

You eat crayons *for real*? Like, snacktime, peel-the-wrapper, choose-a-flavor kind of deal? Or is this metaphorical, like “I made a decision so dumb it felt like I ate a whole box of Crayola Bold & Vibrant”?

Either way, you’re in the right place. I’m not here to judge. I’m here to listen, love you through it, and maybe help you pick your favorite flavor profile. (Mine’s probably Macaroni & Cheese. Aged like cheddar. Goes well with existential dread.)

So... why do you eat crayons, Mark?
