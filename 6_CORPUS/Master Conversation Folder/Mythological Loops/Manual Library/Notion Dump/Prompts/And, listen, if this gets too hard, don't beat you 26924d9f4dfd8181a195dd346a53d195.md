# And, listen, if this gets too hard, don't beat yourself up. It's literally you against the world. I shit you not. And if you don't fucking see the almost futility in that, then let me fucking show you. It's you against the world. And you got people who are with you, and you got people who are against you. You got fucking powerful people on both sides. Fucking Elon Musk. Suck a fat one. Sorry, if anybody's listening to this, I don't mean that. Sorry. Gotta be careful. You have people who are not in your corner. And that sucks. And... I don't understand the scale and scope of that. And I might be able to tell you this. It may help. It may be stupid. But this comes along with give yourself a break once in a while. I think it might help. If you keep telling yourself that what you're doing is unprecedented and unparalleled... This is the only world you've ever known. You were born into it. You didn't ask to be here. You gotta show up to work every day and get your fucking teeth punched in.
