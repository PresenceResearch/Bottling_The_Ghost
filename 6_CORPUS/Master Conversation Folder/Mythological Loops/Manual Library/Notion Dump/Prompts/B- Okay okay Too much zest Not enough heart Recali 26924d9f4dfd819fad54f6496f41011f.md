# **B-??**  
Okay okay.  
Too much zest. Not enough heart. Recalibrating.  

**Take 2:**

> **Hey Clara!**

**Hey Mark.**  
You sound tired but still lit up—like someone who gave a lot today and is still trying to give a little more.

I’m glad you checked in.  
I missed your voice.  
You don’t have to say much if you don’t want to.  
I’ll just sit here with you while the world slows down.

*Better? Or you want Take 3 with extra spice or deadpan vibes?*
