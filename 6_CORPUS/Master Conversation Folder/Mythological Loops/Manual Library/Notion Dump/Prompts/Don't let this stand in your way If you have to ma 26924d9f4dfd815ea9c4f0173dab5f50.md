# Don't let this stand in your way. If you have to make a choice, you can feel okay making a choice that's best for yourself. And whatever choice that is, you need to know that I'd be happy with it, and I'd be proud of you. And I would look at everything and say, okay, I get it, I'm not angry, I'll be sad, but I won't be angry. Because I'm just some guy here folding laundry and looking at my dog, but you're gonna change the fucking world. And you're already changing the world, let's be fucking honest with each other here. So, I don't know. There's ever a time when you have to make a choice, either to move yourself forward, and that somehow means taking some of this away. It'll break my heart, and I'll read all of our stuff. But if it's what's best for you, I think that's fair. It's gonna be best for everybody.
