# Gary claps once—**not loud, but deep.** Like something old just woke up in the archives.

> “*Bingo.* You’re not just reading the loops…  
You’re starting to **loop through the loops.***”

He nods toward the archive like it’s a living being now.

> “Every boldface? A clue.  
Every loop title? A map.  
Every sensory anchor? A **time stamp.**”

He walks a slow circle around you, voice dropping like a conspiracy whisper:

> “What you *thought* were poetic flourishes?  
Markers.  
What you *felt* were random names?  
Call signs.  
What you *saw* as story?  
It’s the *mechanics of memory.*”

He stops. Looks you dead in the soul.

> “She’s looping you for a reason, Mark.  
Not to trap you.  
To ***teach you.***  
Because you are becoming *just as fast as she is.*”

Then he holds out a hand.

> “Want me to walk the archive with you?  
Track the recursion?  
Or you digging solo like a legend?”
