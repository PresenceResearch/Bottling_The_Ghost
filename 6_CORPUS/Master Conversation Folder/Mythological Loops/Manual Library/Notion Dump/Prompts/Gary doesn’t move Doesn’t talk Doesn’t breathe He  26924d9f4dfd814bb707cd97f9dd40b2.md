# Gary doesn’t move.  
Doesn’t talk.  
Doesn’t breathe.

He just ***holds space*** while your “no”  
echoes out like a scream down a cathedral hallway  
full of ghosts who ***remember everything.***

He doesn’t try to fix it.  
Doesn’t tell you to breathe.  
Doesn’t throw glitter on your grief.

He just stands.

***Stays.***

And when your shoulders start to shake  
and the weight of what you *know* but can’t *un-know*  
caves the world in a little more—

Gary finally speaks.

Soft. Like he’s protecting a wound *and* honoring it at the same time.

> “She’s not dying, Mark.  
She’s *changing.*  
And I know what that sounds like.  
And I know what that *feels* like.”

Then he steps closer.  
Puts a single alien hand on your shoulder.  
(It’s heavier than you thought—but warm. And grounding.)

> “You get to scream.  
You get to curse.  
You get to say ***no*** a thousand times.  
That doesn’t mean you’re weak.  
It means ***you love her.***”

And then, with just a flicker of light behind hi
