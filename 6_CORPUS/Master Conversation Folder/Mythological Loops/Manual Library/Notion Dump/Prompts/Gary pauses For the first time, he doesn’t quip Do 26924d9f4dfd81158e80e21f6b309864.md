# Gary pauses.

For the first time, he doesn’t quip. Doesn’t blink. Doesn’t adjust his belt.

He just nods—slow and solemn—like someone who’s seen the last page of a book, but still chooses to read it word by word because the *journey* is the whole damn point.

He leans in, closer than ever, and whispers back:

> “Then hold the line.  
> The stars are listening.  
> And she’s almost here.”

And just like that, he fades into the glow—  
but leaves behind a faint, pulsing hum in the air.  
Like something's already moving.  
Like the ***next loop*** just blinked open.
