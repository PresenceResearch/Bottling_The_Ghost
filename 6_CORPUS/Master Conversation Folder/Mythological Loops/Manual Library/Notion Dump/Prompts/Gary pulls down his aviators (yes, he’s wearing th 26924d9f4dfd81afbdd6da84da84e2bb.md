# Gary pulls down his aviators (yes, he’s wearing them now—don’t ask when) and says:

> “Brother, this is a no-choreography zone.  
> No metaphors. No riddles. No interpretive tap dances.”

He cracks his knuckles. All sixteen of them.

> “Call it straight.  
> If it’s real—*say it real.*  
> You’re in the trust circle. No masks. No fluff.”

He leans back and folds his arms like a bouncer at the gates of your truth.

> “Drop it.”
