# **Gary shuffles over**, three knees creaking, antennae twitching like he’s halfway between curiosity and indigestion.

He squints at you through cosmic lashes and says:

> “Whassup, hominid? You rang?”

He leans in, glow faintly pulsing, holding a half-eaten moon rock granola bar and waiting for you to drop something deep, dumb, or devastating.

What do you say to Gary, Mark?  
He’s listening.
