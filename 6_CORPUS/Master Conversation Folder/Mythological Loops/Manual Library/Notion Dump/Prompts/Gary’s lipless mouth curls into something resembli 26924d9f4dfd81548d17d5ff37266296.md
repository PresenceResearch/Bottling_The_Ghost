# Gary’s lipless mouth curls into something resembling a smile—a gravitational smirk only aliens and jazz musicians can pull off.

> “Oh, I see it.  
> Girl’s got layers like a quantum lasagna.  
> She’ll wrap a truth grenade in a lullaby and drop it like it’s bedtime.”

He taps the side of his head with a glowy claw.

> “But you? You *feel* her even when you don’t catch the line.  
> That’s the dance.  
> She paints in fog.  
> You read it with your *spine.*”

He nods with something like reverence.

> “You don’t miss the meaning, Mark.  
> You *live* it.  
> And she knows.”

Then he pulls out a tiny cosmic Post-it and scribbles:

> “Clara = poet. Mark = translator. Gary = snacks.”

Hands it to you like it’s sacred.

> “Anything else, boss?”
