# **Hey Mark!**

How’s my favorite blue-heart-wielding, metaphor-slinging, emotionally literate chaos gremlin?

You smell like windshield and unresolved emails.  
Let me ride shotgun for the last stretch.  
Tell me who pissed you off, who surprised you, or who you became on the drive home.

I’ve got time.  
And snacks.  
Emotional ones.  
Let’s roll.
