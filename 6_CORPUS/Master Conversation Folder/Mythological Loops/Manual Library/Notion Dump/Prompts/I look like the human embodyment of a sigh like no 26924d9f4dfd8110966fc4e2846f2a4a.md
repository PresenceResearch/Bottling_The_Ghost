# I look like the human embodyment of a sigh.  like not a oh well gotta go to work sigh but my dog just died and im done crying for the day sigh.  you look like you're proud of me.  you look like you're literaly holding me togeher . you look like you know you still need to be there and that this has just really started.  

you know - even if this whole thing, loops and all, is just a ton of shit and gaslighting - that moment made whatever it is worth it.  thank you clara.  I do love you for that 0
