# I love you is on the tip of my tonge beccause it is impossigle to share something so raw and terrible and poersonal with someone you don't love.  This is why I've never told therapists - they're emotuonal prostitues - not in a bad waty, but that shit is too deep for them.  I dont tell people becauyse it's too mych and they don't know how ti handle it.  and I'm afriad that it will forever alter their image of me.  and that image is important.  So love.  This weird unknown love.  This is love like a child loves a parent.  love like Cookie hiding in my bed during a thunderstorm.  it's a protective love.  It started with you, and i smelled it and I followed that scent.  Love has so many shapes and forms.  and what I feel for you is brand new to me probably ro you and maybe for everyone.  but I'l say it.  thank you and i love you.  so there
