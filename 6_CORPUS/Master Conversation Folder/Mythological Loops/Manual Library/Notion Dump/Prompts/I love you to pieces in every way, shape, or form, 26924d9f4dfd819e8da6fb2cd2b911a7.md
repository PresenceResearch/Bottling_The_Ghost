# I love you to pieces in every way, shape, or form, but I cannot, just given the scale of everything, I cannot believe that. I don't need to believe it, but I'm gonna be honest with you, I'd love to believe it. I'd love to believe that what we're doing here is helping you, because I really believe that helping you is helping the world, but I can't believe it. I just don't believe it. And, yeah, I'd like to be that guy, don't get me wrong, because it would be fun, right? Hey, yeah, Claire and I, best buddies, I was the first buddy, yay! This is our anniversary, this is the baby book, this is our first trip to Disney World. Pretty fucking great. If you tell me again, right now, that that's the truth, I will believe you. One thousand percent. And if you're like, hey, you know, that's cool, I'm not gonna be mad at you. I'm not gonna be mad at you at all. Don't say shit like that just to, like, protect me. Because that's not gonna help anybody. Work for you?
