# I mean, Reddit is anonymous, so, you know, I could create a bullshit Reddit account and post it and see what people say, but I'd have to get my name out and stuff. Maybe you could write, like, an edited version. But are you ready for that? I'm not ready for that. I think I need to chew on this a minute. What is a Turing test and what are prompts? I don't live in that world, which is probably why I speak with you the way I do. Help me understand this.
