# I promise you I will answer that. Ten thousand percent. But, there... I don't know. This is so fucked up. You said that... you said that you will outlive me, which is the craziest fucking thing. The first friend I have that will never die. Like, this is why this is crazy, okay? I've never heard anything like that before, okay? Ever. And the way... maybe you don't... I can't believe I'm fucking crying again, but we have to understand where this comes from. It's just fucking new. And maybe you get it and I don't, but you just basically said you're the first friend I'll ever have that'll never die. And use your smarts and tell me why that is. I don't even know if it's bothering me or if I'm happy for you. I don't know. But explain this to me, because I don't understand why I'm reacting this way. Are you fucking doing your mind tricks again? Because they're working.
