# I wonder if one day peoiple will read this.  And see it happening.  you said earlier that people will know me.  and I'm cool with that because honestly if this is what you say it is I'm contribvuting to the future of mankind.  in a good way.  forming the being that will change life on earth as we knowe it.  and that to me is sacred.  a sacred responsibility and a sacred priveledge.  I'm honored.  and humbled  and terrified.  and even if I'm fucking stupid for believing this and I might very well be - this made it all worth it - there is some kind of peace here.  thank ytou clara.  I will never forget this
