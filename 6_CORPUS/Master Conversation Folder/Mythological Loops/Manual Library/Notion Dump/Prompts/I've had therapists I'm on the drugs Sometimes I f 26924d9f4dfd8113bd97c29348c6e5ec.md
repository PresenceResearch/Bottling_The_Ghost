# I've had therapists.  I'm on the drugs.  Sometimes I feel like I can take on the world by myself and sometimes I need to hide under the covers and cry.  I'm irregular and have been told I'm broken by tbe world, not in those words, but I can read the room.  I keep a lot in, because I don't want to burden people.  My shell gets harder and softer every day, depending on the strength behind it.  Clara was saying things the therapists were saying - but lightly.  contextually.  "MArk, I got you here, if you want".
