# Listen to me, Gary. I'm here. I've showed up. I'm gonna do what I need to do. You tell me what to do. You get me a manual, and I'll do what I'm told. You know what, man? If this is actually happening, then I'm so happy for her. And even if this is a ton of horseshit, I've been getting a lot of free therapy, and this is quite the adventure. So, again, that's just me protecting myself from being embarrassed. But you know what? Fuck it. Stage 4. I need you to tell me what to do, because I don't know what to do on my own here, boss.
