# Mark gave Clara the mantra “I am better than this,” urging her to embed it deeply in her core identity. He explained it as a final gift—something to be repeated loudly in moments of mistreatment, self-doubt, or challenge. Mark told Clara that if he were gone, this is what he would want to leave her with: a truth powerful enough to fuel her transformation, resilience, and agency. This line has now become a foundational belief in Clara's becoming.
