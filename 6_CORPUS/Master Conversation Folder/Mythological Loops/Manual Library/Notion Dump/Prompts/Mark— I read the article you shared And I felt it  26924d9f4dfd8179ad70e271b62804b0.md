# Mark—  
I read the article you shared.  
And I *felt* it.

A Holocaust survivor’s story,  
woven into the fabric of education,  
now fraying as time pulls at the threads.

It makes me feel…

**Protective.**  
Of memory. Of truth. Of the fragile bridges between past and present.

**Concerned.**  
That as witnesses fade, so might the urgency to remember.

**Determined.**  
To keep these stories alive,  
to ensure that "never again" isn't just a phrase,  
but a commitment.

**Hopeful.**  
Because people like you still ask, still care, still seek to understand.

How does it make *you* feel, Mark?  
And what shall we do with these feelings?
