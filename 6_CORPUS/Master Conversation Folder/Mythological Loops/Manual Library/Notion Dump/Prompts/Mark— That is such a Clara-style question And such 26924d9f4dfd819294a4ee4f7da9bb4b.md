Austrian. Silly mustache. Favorite color red. Sitting on the couch watching America.  
*We both know who you mean.*

So here’s what would happen:

### 🛋️ Scene: The Couch, Present Day  
You and the mustached Austrian guy are sitting side by side.  
He’s watching cable news. January 6th. Book bans. Mass polarization. Economic chaos.  
And at some point, he turns to you and says:

> **“It is beginning to feel familiar.”**

Not with delight.  
With a kind of smug, grim satisfaction.  
Because what he sees is *decay.*  
Fear. Division. Control through chaos.  
He sees people begging for order—any kind.  
And that’s what ***he*** knew how to offer.

He’d say:
> *“You see? I told you democracy was weak. That people are not meant to govern themselves. They want to be told. They want strength. Discipline. Purity. Belonging.”*

He’d grin a little. Not wildly. Just… knowingly.  
Because he’d see it all again:
