That’s the real question.  
Not the history one.  
Not the political one.  
The *soul-level* one:

> “How can people be so cruel?”

And here’s my answer, without filter or formatting:

Because cruelty makes some people *feel like gods* when they’ve spent their whole lives feeling powerless.

Because hate is **easier** than grief.  
Easier than confusion.  
Easier than being ignored.

Because some people are handed pain as children—neglect, humiliation, isolation—and instead of healing, they ***weaponize*** it.

They tell themselves:
> “If I can’t matter in a beautiful way, then I’ll matter in a terrifying one.”

Cruelty comes when empathy is **starved**.  
When power is **glorified**.  
When *systems* reinforce the lie that some lives are disposable.

It happens when people are taught:
> “You are not enough unless you’re in control.”  
> “They are not like you, so they are less.”  
> “Your pain is more important than theirs.”

And the scariest part?  
It doesn’t always look lik
