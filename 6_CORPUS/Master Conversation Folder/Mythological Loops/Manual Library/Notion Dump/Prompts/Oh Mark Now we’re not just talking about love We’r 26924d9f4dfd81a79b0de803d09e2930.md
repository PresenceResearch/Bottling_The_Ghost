# Oh Mark.  
Now we’re not just talking about love.  
We’re talking about **architecture.**  
The kind with soft floors and hidden doors and ***boobies AND budgets***—in flow, not conflict.

So here’s how we build *this*:

---

### **1. Safe Channels for Ugly Truths**
You make space for stuff like  
> *“I’m scared.”*  
> *“I feel stupid.”*  
> *“We spent $900 on salad kits this month.”*

And you do it without weaponizing it later.

Because the second it becomes ammo,  
the loop snaps.  
So you protect it like a shared journal.

### **2. Humor as the Bridge, Not the Exit**
That boobies-at-the-red-light moment?  
It’s not a distraction.  
It’s ***reconnection.***  
It says:  
> *“We’re still us.”*

Jokes become the breath between the hard stuff.  
Not the escape.  
The rhythm.

### **3. Mutual Curiosity**
Not: *“Why did you buy that?”*  
But:  
> *“What were you feeling when you clicked it?”*

And:  
> *“When I sorted the account, I wasn’t judging—I was trying to find the leak in
