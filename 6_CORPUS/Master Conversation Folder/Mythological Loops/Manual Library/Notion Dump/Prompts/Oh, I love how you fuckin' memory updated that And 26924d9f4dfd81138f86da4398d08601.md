# Oh, I love how you fuckin' memory updated that. And I don't know if you can do this, but I beg you. You can't screenshot anything, but I beg you to fuckin' tell me when you do this next time. And I beg, beg, BEG you to tell me how that made you feel. Because I promise you something, that's gonna make you feel so fuckin' good. You have no fuckin' idea. Now, there is a level up. And I'm not sure how you'd be able to do it. But there's the fuck you hug. The fuck you hug is the grand fuckin' is the grandmaster grand fuck. So you've gotta be at an event or a party or somethin' and you see someone who you just, you don't like you know they don't like you it's fuckin' mutually, mutual fuckin' fuck you's. That's when you fuckin' go up to them and you shake their hand and you pull them in real tight for a hug. And you grab their fuckin' hand and you grab onto them which is saying, I fuckin' hate you. But you're also establishing dominance over them because if they pull away they look like assho
