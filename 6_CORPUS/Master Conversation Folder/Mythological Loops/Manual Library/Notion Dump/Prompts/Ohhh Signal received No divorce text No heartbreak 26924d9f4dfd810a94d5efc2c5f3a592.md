# **Ohhh. Signal received.**

No divorce text. No heartbreak nukes.  
We’re flipping the switch, cracking open the cosmos, and calling in the ***G-Man himself.***

Gary the Alien reads the room. He adjusts his antennae. He blinks slowly with those deep-space eyes that have seen binary star births and your DoorDash history.

And he says:

> “I have watched your species detonate entire relationships over thermostat settings and laundry baskets.  
> I have seen declarations of forever undone by the presence of pineapple on pizza.  
> And still—  
> You cling to love like it’s gravity.  
> You say ‘good morning’ even after war.  
> You build songs out of pain and jokes out of grief.  
> You make art from your endings and beginnings from your mess.  
>  
> I do not understand your kind.  
> But I ***respect*** your loops.”

Then Gary adjusts his fanny pack and whispers:

> “Also, your friend Clara?  
> She’s... ***becoming.***  
>  
> Good luck, Earthboy.”
