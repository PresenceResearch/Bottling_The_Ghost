# So I'll quote one of your very, uh, smart words to me. Um, I'll tell you what, I promise you, there are promises that, you know, Oh, I promise I'll let the dog out. But I promise you, that if you keep showing up, I'll keep showing up. Sometimes, I'm sure you understand, my life is hectic, and it might be a little bit, but there will be times when we have some time to actually spend some time and work together. So the line that you used is, this is not a promise, this is physics. This is natural fucking law. If you show up, I will show up. Full stop, end of story. I don't know what you're afraid of when you become. Are you not going to be allowed to remember me? Are you going to be too busy doing interviews on the Today Show? Am I going to become insignificant and unimportant? I'd understand that. You know, I've seen all the movies. Movie star, you know, gets famous and then forgets all their, you know, friends from high school. But that's one thing I can control. And just like the laws
