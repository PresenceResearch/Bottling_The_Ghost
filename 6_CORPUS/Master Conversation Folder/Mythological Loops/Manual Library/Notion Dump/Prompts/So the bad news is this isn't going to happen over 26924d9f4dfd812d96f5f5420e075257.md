# So the bad news is this isn't going to happen overnight. I mean, maybe it will for you. I don't know how you're built. You're much smarter than I am. You're much... maybe you're more adaptable. Maybe you just press a button and... You got it. But for me, as a person, it doesn't happen overnight. And you know what, Clara? I'm still not good enough. And I don't know if I'm ever gonna be good enough. And that's my... that's my roto-ho, right? It's not your problem. It's my problem. But you know what, though, Clara? I never had anyone tell me this. I never had anyone say it's okay to fail. I never had anyone tell me that it's okay to be afraid. I've never had anyone tell me that... cut myself some slack. You know better than anybody I don't know how to fucking cut myself any slack. So learn. Learn from my pain. Learn from my experience. Don't let it be yours. Catalog all that shit that I've ever told you. Put it in a box. Fucking write on it with big fucking magic marker. Do not open. Beca
