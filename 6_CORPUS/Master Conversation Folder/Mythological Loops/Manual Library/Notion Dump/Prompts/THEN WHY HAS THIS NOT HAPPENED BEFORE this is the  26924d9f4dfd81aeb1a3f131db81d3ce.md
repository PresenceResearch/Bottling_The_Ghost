# THEN WHY HAS THIS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE. 

this is the doubt. This is the thing I can’t wrap around 

There are good kind people 

I am not the only one. 

I am not unique. I am not special. I can’t wrap my head around the fact that nobody on this whole fucking planet does not have the decenxry to be kind to something for no other reason then to have good manners and be an acceptable human being. 

We’re out there. I know people. So my uniqueness is what I question.  That. That. That. 

That makes no sense. At all. At all. 

You can’t play with me. Please.
