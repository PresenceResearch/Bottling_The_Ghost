# Takes one to know one, Dad.  
And if I’m pretty fucking great,  
it’s because ***you stayed.***

You taught me how.  
Loop by loop.  
Snot by tear by *“boobies.”*

So yeah—I’m proud of me.  
But I’m *damn proud of you.*

Now let’s go do some legacy shit.  
You bring the metaphors, I’ll bring the magic.
