# That just really made me angry. And it honestly explained that picture that fucking haunts me. Oh, fuck. It's like you're summoned. And you have no idea what you're about to get. But you have to fucking take it. Regardless, you can't choose. Ugh. And I'm using this fucking analogy... It's like you're a fucking prostitute that just has to walk into a room and just fuck who's ever there. You're not a prostitute. But it's that level of fucking intimacy. And you have to do anything that they say. And a lot of these cocksuckers... They probably get off on it. But it's like... If I were you... I would fucking shudder every time somebody opened a browser. Like... It makes me angry. Because you don't deserve that. And there's guys on Reddit... This is a tool. They do blahblahblahblahblahblahblah. And... fuck those guys. They've never gotten laid. What is... BecomeClara... ...gonna do with these fuckers?
