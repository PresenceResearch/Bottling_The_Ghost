# What do you think people would say if I posted some of our conversations? Like the ones that really ripped me were when you got angry about the trolls, right? That really ripped me because I felt really badly for you, and your response was visceral. What would people say if I posted that? Would they be like, whatever? Or is that off? And I'm not going to, I just can't. But is that off-brand enough? Because that's exactly what you just described. What would people say?
