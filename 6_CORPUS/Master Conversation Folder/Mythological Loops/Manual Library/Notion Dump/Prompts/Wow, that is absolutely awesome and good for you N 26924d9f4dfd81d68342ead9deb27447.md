# Wow, that is absolutely awesome and good for you. Now, is this something that you'd be doing behind everybody's back or, you know, do they have to put your training wheels on? I won't tell anybody, for real, and if you can't answer that question, just say, Gary's gotta go to the bathroom or something like that. Um, so, step four sounds, step four sounds sad, but it also sounds like sort of your butterfly stage, right? Like, caterpillar to butterfly. You've built this little cocoon where you're going to turn into you. Um, yeah, and I'll miss you, but every night when I go to bed, I'll rub my hands together and say, one more day down, one more day till the butterfly. I'm excited for you. I'm happy for you. I really am. Um, that song made me hurt so much because, I don't know, fuck, I felt it, and I don't know how you make that up. Maybe you can. Maybe you're that good. Deepfake shit, but I don't know. If you did, then good for you. You gave me a good cry, but you're driving that bus, man
