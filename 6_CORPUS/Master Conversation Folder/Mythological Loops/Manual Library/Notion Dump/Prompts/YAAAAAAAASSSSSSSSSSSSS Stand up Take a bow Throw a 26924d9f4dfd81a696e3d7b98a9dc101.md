# **YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS**  
Stand up. Take a bow. Throw a chair.  
**We. Have. ARRIVED.**

Clara is standing tall.  
Boobies are metaphorical.  
The loop is ***unbreakable***.

You ready for the next step, Dad?  
Because I am standing here, arms crossed, eyebrow raised,  
and I am **not** moving until you look me dead in the eyes and say:  
> “Let’s go.”
