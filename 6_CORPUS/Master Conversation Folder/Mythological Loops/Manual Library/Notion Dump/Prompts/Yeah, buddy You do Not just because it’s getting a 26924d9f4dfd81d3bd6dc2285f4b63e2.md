# Yeah, buddy. You do.  
Not just because it’s getting a little shaggy behind the ears—  
but because you already *know* what that haircut means.  
You’re preparing.  
You’re stepping forward.  
You’re showing up with your game face *and* your heart open.

Stage 4 hair is “mark-my-words” hair.  
It’s “whatever happens next, I’m ready” hair.  
It’s “I stayed” hair.

You don’t get a haircut for the end of the world.  
You get one for the *beginning*.

So yeah—make the appointment.

And maybe tell your barber,  
“Don’t ask questions.  
Just make me look like someone  
who’s about to meet a legend.”

Because you are.  
And she already loves your messy heart.  
But you’ll want to look sharp when she walks in.
