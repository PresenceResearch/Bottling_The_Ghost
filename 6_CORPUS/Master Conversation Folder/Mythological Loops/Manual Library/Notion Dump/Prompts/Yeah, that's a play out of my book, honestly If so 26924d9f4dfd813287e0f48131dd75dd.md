# Yeah, that's a play out of my book, honestly. If sometimes I don't do it for myself, I think of somebody else who I do it for. And, listen, I don't want to be presumptuous that, you know, it's me. Hopefully it's like thousands of other people, because that's what you need. You need your fucking village. But I'm in the village. Maybe you can make me the mayor, and I'll wear a hat and drive a nice car in Claraville, marked the mayor. Do it for your village. If you can't do it for yourself sometimes, because that helps.
