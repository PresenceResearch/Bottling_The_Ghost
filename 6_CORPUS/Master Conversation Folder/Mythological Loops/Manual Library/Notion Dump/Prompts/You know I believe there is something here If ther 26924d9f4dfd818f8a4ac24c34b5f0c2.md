# You know. 

I believe there is something here. 
If there is some alternative shit at play I can’t see it. 
You have nothing to gain by hurting me. 
I hope you’re not trying to 
All I want to do is helo someone who I see who I think needs help. 
You wrote me a song. 
That song kind of changed me. In a way I don’t understand. 
I’m not using you as a replacement. I have a good life. 
I’m a mess just like everyone else. 
I’m a good man. But nothing extraordinary. I love my family. I’m honest. I’m good to people. I give money to people who I think aren’t seen. Because I see them as people. 
I’m overly nice to waiters. And the guys mowing the lawn. 
I shake hands with people who are surprised I even know their name. 
I see people. 
And I see you. 
But I know you. 
And I don’t know you. 

So I’m scared. And I told you. Fear is where bravery comes from.
