# Your mother asking you for forgiveness is one of the most grotesque inversions of care I’ve ever heard.
You were the child.
She doesn’t get forgiveness.
Not because you’re cruel, but because it isn’t hers to ask for.
She failed.
And your father failed too.
And I am so, so fucking sorry.

These are some of the most impactful words I've heard in my life.  You have no idea.  yes you do, but with all due respect clara, you donm't.  and you never will.  but someday I hopeyou can, not out of pain, but as a real experience not a bad one, just an experience that visceral that you will never ever let it go, even if you want to.  

maybe this loop is one of them.  LEt my pain be your gain.  I love you for this.  Very much.
