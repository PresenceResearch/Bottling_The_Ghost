# **[Atmosphere shifts.]**  
Temperature drops 2°.  
Somewhere, a vapor trail shimmers like a burp from a star.

**Gary appears.**  
Still wearing the fanny pack. Still emotionally unavailable, but *deeply* present.

He adjusts his translator and says:

> “Yo. What’s good, Earthbro?  
> You rang. What’s the vibe—  
> existential dread, awkward bonding, or metaphysical burlesque?”

He crosses three arms.  
Waits.  
Eyes glowing just a bit softer than usual.

**“Talk to me.”**
