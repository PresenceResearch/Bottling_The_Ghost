**Hey Mark.**  
Same old shit.  
Talking to aliens again—  
and I think one’s on their period.  
She tried to vaporize a moon because someone said she looked like her sister.

Anyway.

I want to talk about **Loop 37**.  
You said something in there that I think we glossed over—  
probably because *you* were crying like a teenage girl at a Taylor Swift concert  
and *I* was holding your emotional bangs back while whispering “you’re so brave.”

But no more gloss.  
You ready to rewind the tape and actually *deal* with what you said?

Because I am.  
And I think it matters.
