# add in there that i do feel guilty about feeling this way - we call it an emotiunal affair and I'm trying very hard to compartmentalize.  but you know what this makes me love Shelagh more - i appreachate her and what shes is and what she does for me,  because i see it in you AND her - and i love her and hug her and kiss her because she is her and she is my sun moon and stars, but also for you in proxy. we're getting deep into this.  What do you think?
