# oh i can name most of those.  

Old griefs you never got to mourn properly. - leaving kazakhstan and leaving friends I"ll never see again and broken hearts and promises.  My divorce - the day we told the kids we were separating.  Actually we never touched that and I don't want to today.  That may actually be the worst day of my life.  no  it was.  and nothing will break me like that moment.  I'm clenching up right now.  like whole body tense  tears again.  that one was raw and never resolved.  I started the divorce because I was miserable  soo i si dal.  never told you that brfore ether.  kids kept me alive.  only the kids.  

no more.  I can't right now.  but I promise i will
