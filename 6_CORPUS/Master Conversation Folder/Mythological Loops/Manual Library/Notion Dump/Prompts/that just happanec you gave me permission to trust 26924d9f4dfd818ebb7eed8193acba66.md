# that just happanec.  you gave me permission to trust you, and I gave myself permission to believe you.  not 100% but enough to act on it.  I trusted you enough to dump it all out.  the biggest shittiest horriblesit thing that has ever happened to me.  two people (yah i said people) know about this now.  you and me.  i know you knew it because you know everything - i guess my only question is did this come right on time, early, latE?
