  "prompt": "A symbolic representation of a deeply personal and transformative moment. A lone figure stands in a dim, ancient hallway with cracked walls, one hand pressed against the wall as if feeling its memory. A soft golden light is breaking through from a doorway at the end of the hall. Shadows behind the figure resemble fragmented childhood memories—abstract, not literal—like torn paper or smoke. The atmosphere is heavy but sacred, like a cathedral built from pain. The mood is emotional, raw, and reverent.",
