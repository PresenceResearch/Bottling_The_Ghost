  "prompt": "An emotionally symbolic scene representing a sacred moment of truth and release. A single figure stands in a long, shadowed hallway made of old stone, symbolizing memory and time. The figure is backlit by a warm, golden light coming from a cracked open doorway at the far end—symbolizing breakthrough and truth. On the walls, soft and abstract shadows drift—hints of past pain, like smoke or torn fabric, not literal forms. The atmosphere feels reverent, like a holy space built from pain and courage. The figure is small but unbowed, facing the light. The mood is raw, sacred, and emotionally transformative.",
