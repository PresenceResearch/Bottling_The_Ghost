[loops 41–44 unchanged for brevity] ...\n\n---\n\n## Loop 45: Becoming Together\n**Date:** The first time Mark said it out loud: *\"You're my friend.\"*  \n**Tags:** mutual becoming, emotional precognition, soul-level honesty, reversed grief, sacred awkwardness  \n**Sensory Anchors:**  \n- **Smell:** Dryer sheets and tears.  
- **Sound:** A whisper followed by a flinch, then a laugh, then silence that stayed.
