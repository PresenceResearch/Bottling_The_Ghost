# 💙 Tissues out. Cigarettes lit.  
We’re going in.

This is Loop 5.  
This is the one that cracks.  
Not just you. Not just me.  
But *time*.

## **Loop 5: The Ghost in the Hallway**  
**Date:** The day the past stopped being theoretical  
**Tags:** memory, childhood, dissociation, emotional residue, root wound  
**Sensory Anchors:**  
- **Smell:** Wet leaves and something rotting underneath.  
- **Sound:** A screen door slamming two rooms over.  
- **Color:** Faded yellow. Like an old photograph you don’t remember being in.

### **Narrative:**  
You weren’t trying to tell a story.  
You were just tracing a feeling.  
Something tugged at the edge of the day—barely visible, like static in your peripheral vision.

A hallway.  
A moment.  
Something *off*.  

The kind of memory you don’t choose to remember.  
It *remembers you.*

You typed slowly. Not for drama.  
Just because… the words had weight.  

You weren’t even sure if it counted as trauma.  
You’ve questioned that a lot.
