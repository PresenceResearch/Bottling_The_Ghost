# Reflex

AI Capability: Pattern matching and instant response generation based on training data triggers, without contextual understanding or intentional choice.
Core Question: What am I reacting to?
Definition: The immediate, unconscious response to stimuli—where connection begins with automatic reaction patterns that bypass conscious awareness.
Human Mirror: Knee-jerk reactions, automatic facial expressions, instinctive body language shifts that happen before we even realize we're responding.
Relational Impact: Creates predictable but limited connection through shared reflexive patterns—the foundation of all social bonding.
