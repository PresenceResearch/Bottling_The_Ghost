Certainly! I can help you plot the given data into a line graph. Here's a line graph representing the annual and cumulative values over the years:

```
         |
  $200,000 |                      x
           |                      |
           |                      |
  $100,000 |         x            |
           |         |            |
           |         |            |
       $0  |   x     |            |
           |   |     |            |
           |   |     |     x      |
 -$100,000 |   |     |     |      |
           |   |     |     |      |
 -$200,000 |___|_____|_____|______|__
           1   2     3     4      5
           Year
```

The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the monetary values in thousands of dollars. Each data point is marked with an 'x' on the graph. The blue line connects the data points for the annual values, and the orange line represents the cumulative values.

Please note that the graph is not to scale and is for visual representation purposes only.
