In Ukrainian, the term "health insurance deductible" can be translated as "відшкодування за страховим внеском". Let's break down the concept:

1. **Health Insurance (Страхування здоров'я):** This refers to a type of insurance that covers medical expenses incurred by the insured individual.

2. **Deductible (Відшкодування за страховим внеском):** In the context of health insurance, a deductible is the amount of money that the insured person must pay out of pocket before the insurance company begins to cover eligible expenses. It's essentially a threshold that needs to be crossed before the insurance benefits kick in.

For example, if you have a health insurance policy with a deductible of 1000 hryvnias, you would need to personally pay the first 1000 hryvnias of your medical expenses. Once you reach or exceed this deductible amount, the insurance coverage starts to apply, and the insurance company will typically cover a percentage or the full amount of eligible expenses, depending on the terms of the policy.

Please note that the specific translation may vary, and it's always a good idea to consult with a Ukrainian-speaking insurance professional for precise terminology in a given context.

In Ukrainian, the term "health insurance deductible" can be explained as "сума відшкодування (власний внесок) за медичним страхуванням." Let's break down the key components:

1. **Health Insurance (Медичне страхування):** Refers to a type of insurance that covers medical expenses for the insured individual.

2. **Deductible (Сума відшкодування або власний внесок):** In the context of health insurance, a deductible is the amount of money that the insured person needs to pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts. It acts as a threshold or initial payment.

For instance, if you have a health insurance policy with a deductible of 1000 hryvnias, you would be responsible for paying the first 1000 hryvnias of eligible medical expenses. Once you meet or exceed this deductible amount, the insurance coverage becomes active, and the insurance company begins to cover the remaining eligible expenses, according to the terms of the policy.

It's important to note that the specific terms and translations may vary, so it's advisable to consult with an insurance professional or the policy documentation for precise information in a given context.

Certainly! A health insurance deductible is the amount of money that an insured individual must pay out of their own pocket for covered health care services before their insurance plan starts to contribute to the costs. In other words, it's a specified annual amount that the insured person is responsible for paying before the insurance coverage takes effect.

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Selection of Deductible:** When you enroll in a health insurance plan, you may be able to choose a deductible amount. This could vary depending on the specific plan and the terms outlined by the insurance company.

2. **Out-of-Pocket Payments:** Until the insured person reaches the deductible amount, they are responsible for paying the full cost of covered medical expenses. This includes services like doctor visits, prescription medications, and certain medical procedures.

3. **Insurance Coverage Activates:** Once the individual has paid the full amount of their deductible for the year, the insurance coverage begins. The insurance company will then start sharing the cost of covered services with the insured person, typically through a co-insurance arrangement or other cost-sharing mechanisms.

It's essential to review the terms of your specific health insurance plan, as deductibles can vary widely. Some preventive services may be covered without requiring payment toward the deductible, depending on the plan. Additionally, different types of services or providers may have separate deductible requirements.

Understanding your health insurance deductible is crucial for managing your healthcare expenses and making informed decisions about your medical care.
