Sure, here's a camp theme song for Camp Funshine that includes fun activities like drinking tea and taking naps, and ends with "all you have to do is show up":

(Verse 1)
In the heart of the woods, where the sun always shines,
Lies a place of adventure, where the fun intertwines.
At Camp Funshine, every day's a new thrill,
With laughter and joy, time seems to stand still.

(Chorus)
Camp Funshine, where dreams come alive,
Under the sun, our spirits thrive.
With every new dawn, we're ready to leap,
For in this camp, memories we'll keep.

(Verse 2)
We'll sip on our tea, as the morning dew gleams,
Sharing stories and smiles, weaving friendship dreams.
In the noontide, we'll rest, take a nap under trees,
Letting nature's lullaby float in the breeze.

(Bridge)
Here, every moment is a treasured find,
A place of wonder, leaving worries behind.
In the glow of the fire, as stars light up above,
We find the magic of Camp Funshine's love.

(Chorus)
Camp Funshine, where the heart feels light,
In the warmth of the day or the cool of the night.
Embracing each other, in laughter we're wrapped up,
In this haven of joy, all you have to do is show up.

Friendships blossom and new bonds form.
Around the fire, we share our life's cup,
In this sanctuary, where time slows up.

Filled with laughter, under skies so blue.
Gathering together, life's joys we wrap up,
In this haven of peace, all you have to do is show up.

In a haven of green, under skies so blue,
Camp Funshine welcomes, with a view ever new.
Here we gather, with tales to share,
In gardens lush, we tend with care.

Camp Funshine, where our spirits fly,
Under the sun, beneath the wide sky.
With hands in the soil, and hearts full of cheer,
We find a sense of belonging, so dear.

Leisurely walks by the lake, in the gentle breeze,
Watching the ducks glide, in effortless ease.
We craft and create, with laughter and song,
In these golden moments, we truly belong.

Painting, knitting, in creative flow,
Sharing skills and stories of long ago.
As the evening comes, with stars up above,
We cherish the warmth of shared love.

(Chorus)
Camp Funshine, where memories are bright,
In the calm of the morning, in the soft evening light.
Together we're stronger, in this joyful setup,
In this place of serenity, all you have to do is show up.
