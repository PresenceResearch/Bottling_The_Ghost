The contract includes specific details regarding the production guarantee and liquidated damages:

1. **Production Guarantee**: The Design-Builder represents and warrants that for five years from the substantial completion of the project, the system will perform at levels equal to at least 85% of the estimated annual kWh production levels as determined after system commissioning. This performance guarantee is further detailed in Exhibit H of the contract【7†source】.

2. **Liquidated Damages (Shortfall Payment)**: If the project's generation for any Output Measurement Period falls below the Performance Threshold, the Design-Builder is obligated to pay the Owner an amount equal to $0.10 per kWh for the shortfall in generation up to the Performance Threshold. This Shortfall Payment is required to be made no later than fifteen days after the end of each Output Measurement Period. Additionally, any generation above the Performance Threshold for the first or second Output Measurement Period can be carried over to the following year's Output Measurement Period【8†source】.
