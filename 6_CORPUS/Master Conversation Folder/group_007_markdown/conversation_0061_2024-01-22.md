When evaluating a solar array's potential to offset electricity bills, particularly in the context of demand charges, it's essential to approach the calculation with a nuanced understanding of both the solar energy production and the specifics of your electricity tariff. Demand charges are fees that utility companies charge commercial customers based on their peak power usage during a billing period, and they can form a significant part of an electricity bill.

Here's how to accurately take solar production into consideration when calculating demand charges:

1. **Understand Your Demand Charges**: First, get a clear understanding of how your utility company calculates demand charges. This usually involves identifying the peak demand (in kilowatts, kW) during the billing period. Demand charges can be based on the overall peak demand, or during specific times of day (time-of-use rates).

2. **Analyze Your Energy Usage Patterns**: Look at your historical electricity usage to understand when your peaks typically occur. This will help you assess how effectively your solar array can offset these peaks.

3. **Solar Production Data**: Gather detailed data on the energy production from your solar array. This should include hourly production values to align with the periods of your peak energy usage.

4. **Match Solar Production to Peak Demand Periods**: Analyze whether the solar production aligns with your peak demand periods. If your solar array produces the most energy during your peak usage times, it can effectively reduce the demand charges. However, if the peak production from your solar array doesn't coincide with your peak demand, the impact on demand charges will be less significant.

5. **Consider Energy Storage**: If there's a mismatch between solar production and peak demand times, energy storage solutions like batteries can be crucial. They store solar energy when production is high and release it during peak demand periods, helping to reduce demand charges.

6. **Use Monitoring and Predictive Analytics**: Implement a system to monitor both your energy usage and solar production in real time. Advanced systems can even predict your energy usage and optimize the use of solar energy and storage to minimize demand charges.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Energy usage patterns can change over time, so it's important to regularly review and adjust your strategy for using solar energy to offset demand charges.

8. **Professional Consultation**: Since this is a complex area, involving variable factors like weather, energy usage patterns, and changing tariff structures, consulting with an energy management professional or a solar energy consultant can provide tailored advice and solutions.

By aligning solar production with peak demand periods, either directly or through the use of energy storage, you can effectively reduce the demand charges on your electricity bill. Remember, the key is in the detailed and accurate alignment of solar energy production with your specific energy usage patterns and the structure of your utility's demand charges.

In situations where complete information is not available for a detailed analysis, you can still make a general estimation regarding the potential of a solar array to offset electricity bills, including demand charges. However, keep in mind that without specific data on your energy usage patterns, solar production, and the exact structure of your utility's demand charges, the calculation will be more of a rough estimate. Here's a general approach:

1. **Average Solar Production**: Determine the average solar production of your array. This is typically given in kilowatt-hours per day (kWh/day). You might find this as a standard specification for your solar array or based on average production data for your area.

2. **Peak Solar Production Hours**: Estimate the hours of peak solar production. Typically, solar panels produce the most energy during the middle of the day, say from 10 AM to 4 PM. The exact times can vary based on your location and the season.

3. **Demand Charge Rate**: Obtain the rate of the demand charges from your utility bill or utility provider. This is usually in dollars per kilowatt ($/kW).

4. **General Demand Profile**: Without specific data, assume a general demand profile. For instance, you might assume that your peak demand usually occurs during standard business hours for commercial facilities or in the evening for residential properties.

5. **Calculate Estimated Offset**: Use the following general formula to estimate the offset:

   \[ Estimated Demand Reduction (kW) = Average Peak Solar Production (kW) \times Overlap Factor \]

   The Overlap Factor is a rough estimate of the proportion of the solar peak production that coincides with your peak demand period. For example, if you assume half of your solar production is during your peak demand time, use 0.5 as the Overlap Factor.

6. **Estimate Cost Savings**: Multiply the estimated demand reduction by the demand charge rate to get a rough estimate of the cost savings.

   \[ Estimated Cost Savings = Estimated Demand Reduction (kW) \times Demand Charge Rate ($/kW) \]

Remember, this is a very rough estimate. The actual impact of a solar array on demand charges can be significantly influenced by factors such as the exact timing of energy usage peaks, the specific pattern of solar energy production, weather conditions, and any energy storage solutions in use. For a more accurate assessment, gathering detailed data and consulting with an energy expert is advisable.
