I couldn't find specific information about a new bill being proposed that directly affects the solar federal tax credit as of 2024. The current legislation, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, provides a Residential Clean Energy Credit, which equals 30% of the costs of new, qualified clean energy property for your home installed anytime from 2022 through 2032. The credit percentage rate will phase down to 26 percent for property placed in service in 2033 and 22 percent for property placed in service in 2034【0†source】. 

This means the federal solar tax credit is set at 30% for installations completed between 2022 and 2032, offering substantial savings on the installation of solar power systems. There's no mention of a new bill proposing changes to these terms in the near term.

For commercial solar projects, there are specific considerations affecting the solar federal tax credit, especially regarding projects starting construction in 2024 and beyond. Notably, projects that begin construction in 2024 and are 1 MW or larger must meet domestic content requirements to receive the full benefit of the tax credit. If these requirements are not met, such projects may only receive a refund of 90% of the tax credit. This percentage decreases further for projects starting construction in 2025, where only 85% of the tax credit may be refundable, and drops to 0% for projects starting construction after 2025【7:0†source】.

This adjustment emphasizes the government's push towards encouraging the use of domestic materials in large-scale solar projects and impacts the financial incentives available for commercial solar investments starting in 2024.
