To create a graph representing the new Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) commercial rate increases over a 5-year period, I will need specific data regarding the rate increases for each year. Can you provide the annual rate increase percentages or the actual rate values for each year in the 5-year period?

Here is a graph representing the BGE commercial rate increases over a 5-year period, assuming a 3% annual increase. The graph starts from an arbitrary initial rate of 100 (this could represent any unit of measurement or monetary value relevant to the commercial rates). Each year, the rate increases by 3%, demonstrating how the commercial rates would evolve over the 5-year period.
