Here are the line graphs comparing a fixed Solar PPA rate with an increasing utility rate over a 20-year period. Each graph displays the cost in cents per kWh on the Y-axis against the years from 1 to 20 on the X-axis. You can observe the fixed Solar PPA rate at 10 cents per kWh throughout the period, and the increasing utility rate starting at 10 cents per kWh with a 2 percent annual increase.
