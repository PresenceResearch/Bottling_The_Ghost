4. **Going the Extra Mile** - Doing more than what's expected.

11. **Controlled Attention** - Focusing on your goals without distraction.

These principles are not only relevant to financial success but also to personal and professional development. Hill's teachings emphasize that success comes from the combination of a positive attitude, hard work, and the right strategies.

Many contemporary authors, speakers, and coaches have built upon Hill's foundational concepts, adapting them to the current societal and economic context.

My biggest challenge is controlled attention and planning for my day. I generally dive write into issues and problems that need handling without strategizing and prioritizing. Therefore mid to long term projects often never get completed until the last minute, if ever.  Can you recommend ways to improve here?  Any apps or online resources that work?  I also have pretty strong ADHD and get distracted easily. I begin an email or a project and then realize 3 hours later that the email was never sent because I became distracted and forgot that I needed to write it.

**Assistant:**

Improving controlled attention and planning, especially when dealing with ADHD, involves adopting strategies that align with your unique way of processing information and managing tasks. Many tools and techniques can help you strategize, prioritize, and maintain focus on both short-term and long-term projects. Here are some recommendations:

### Strategies for Improved Planning and Attention

1. **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific blocks of time to different tasks or categories of work. This can help you focus on one thing at a time and prevent the day from being consumed by unexpected tasks.

2. **The Two-Minute Rule**: If a task can be done in two minutes or less, do it immediately. This helps keep small tasks from piling up and distracting you from more significant projects.

3. **Pomodoro Technique**: Work for a set period (traditionally 25 minutes), then take a short break (5 minutes). This can help manage your focus and attention, making large tasks less daunting.

4. **Task Prioritization**: Use a system like Eisenhower's Matrix to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. This can help you focus on what truly matters and avoid spending too much time on less critical tasks.

5. **Mind Mapping**: For complex projects, a visual representation of tasks, deadlines, and dependencies can help keep you organized and focused on the next steps.

### Apps and Online Resources

1. **Trello**: A flexible, visual project management tool that can help you organize tasks and projects into boards, lists, and cards. Great for visualizing what needs to be done and prioritizing tasks.

2. **Todoist**: A to-do list app that allows you to organize tasks with priorities, deadlines, and categories. Its simple interface is excellent for quick task entry and tracking.

3. **Notion**: An all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate, and get organized. Notion provides a highly flexible platform for managing tasks, notes, projects, and databases in one place.

4. **Forest**: An app designed to help you stay focused by planting a virtual tree that grows while you work and dies if you leave the app. It's a motivational tool to prevent smartphone distractions.

5. **Freedom**: An app that blocks distracting websites and apps across all your devices. You can schedule focused sessions and block sites that typically distract you.

6. **Focus@Will**: A service that provides music designed to boost your focus and concentration. Especially useful for individuals with ADHD, as the right kind of background music can enhance task performance.

### General Tips for Managing ADHD

- **Routine**: Establish a consistent daily routine to reduce the cognitive load of planning every day from scratch.
- **Break Tasks Down**: Large projects can be overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable tasks.
- **Use Physical Tools**: Sometimes, traditional tools like paper planners or sticky notes can be more effective in keeping track of tasks and deadlines.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider working with a therapist or coach who specializes in ADHD. They can offer personalized strategies and support.

Experiment with these strategies and tools to find what combination works best for you. Managing ADHD and improving productivity is a personal journey, and what works for one person might not work for another.

Is it more productive to answer calls during the middle of concentrated work time or let them wait and call people
Back after your allotted time for a specific project. 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-03-25 07:00:13*

It's generally more productive to let calls wait and call people back after your allotted time for a specific project. This approach aligns with the principles of deep work and controlled attention, which suggest that maintaining focus on a single task without interruptions leads to higher productivity and quality of work. Here's why:

### Minimizing Disruptions Enhances Focus
- **Reduced Task Switching**: Each time you switch tasks, there's a cognitive cost. Your brain needs time to adjust to the new task, then more time to return to the original task, which reduces efficiency and increases the likelihood of errors.
- **Preservation of Flow State**: Achieving a "flow state" requires uninterrupted concentration. Answering calls can break this state, making it hard to regain the same level of deep focus.
- **Energy Conservation**: Constant interruptions drain mental energy, leaving you with less cognitive capacity for the tasks that require deep thought and creativity.

### Strategic Call Management
- **Scheduled Call Times**: Allocating specific times for returning calls can help manage others' expectations and reduce the anxiety associated with missed calls. It also allows you to prepare mentally for each call, ensuring more productive conversations.
- **Urgency Filters**: If possible, set up a system to filter calls by urgency. For instance, let your team know that only calls of utmost urgency should interrupt your focused work time, and provide guidelines for what qualifies as urgent.
- **Voicemail and Auto-Responders**: Use voicemail effectively, and consider setting up an auto-responder for texts or emails to let people know when they can expect a callback. This keeps communication channels open and manages expectations.

### Implementation in Practice
- **Communicate Your Schedule**: Let your colleagues, clients, and others know about your focused work periods and when you'll be available to return calls. This transparency helps in managing expectations and minimizing unnecessary interruptions.
- **Use Technology Wisely**: Tools and apps that block or manage incoming calls can be invaluable. Use Do Not Disturb modes, or apps specifically designed for focus, to ensure that only critical calls get through during your focused work times.
- **Evaluate and Adapt**: Not all roles or industries can completely avoid answering calls for extended periods. Evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy in your context and be willing to adapt your approach as necessary.

Ultimately, the goal is to control your attention and minimize disruptions, thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of your work. While there may be exceptions based on job roles or emergency situations, as a general rule, concentrating on work without interruption from calls is a more productive strategy.

What about incoming emails 

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-03-25 07:01:17*

Handling incoming emails similarly to how you manage calls—by setting aside specific times to check and respond to them—can significantly enhance your productivity and focus. Here's why this approach is effective and how to implement it:

### Benefits of Scheduled Email Checks

1. **Minimizes Distractions**: Constant email notifications can interrupt your train of thought and make it difficult to return to a deep state of concentration. Limiting email checks to specific times helps maintain focus.

2. **Improves Efficiency**: Batching the task of reading and responding to emails can be more efficient than handling them as they come in. This approach allows you to maintain momentum with your work and handle emails in a more organized manner.

3. **Reduces Stress**: Constantly responding to emails can create a sense of being on-call and increase stress. Scheduled email times can help create boundaries that protect your work-life balance.

### Implementing an Email Management Strategy

1. **Designate Specific Times**: Choose one or several times each day for checking and responding to emails. The frequency can depend on the nature of your work; some might need to check emails more often than others. However, even within industries that demand prompt email communication, most people can afford to check emails a few times a day rather than constantly.

2. **Turn Off Notifications**: Disable email notifications during your focused work periods. This prevents the constant ping of incoming emails from pulling your attention away from the task at hand.

3. **Communicate Your Availability**: If your job allows, inform colleagues and clients of your email checking schedule. This sets expectations regarding your response times and can alleviate pressure to be immediately responsive.

4. **Use Tools and Features**: Many email clients offer features that can help manage your inbox, such as:
   - **Automated Responses**: Setting up an auto-responder to inform senders of your email checking times can manage their expectations regarding replies.
   - **Priority Inboxes**: Some email services automatically sort emails into categories (e.g., primary, social, promotions). You can also manually set filters to ensure that you first see the most important emails when you do check.
   - **Email Scheduling**: If you prefer to work on emails during off-hours but don’t want to set the expectation that you’re always available, use tools to schedule your emails to be sent during normal working hours.

5. **Prioritize Responses**: Not all emails require immediate or lengthy responses. Prioritize your replies based on urgency and importance, and consider using templates for common inquiries to save time.

### Adaptation and Flexibility

While this structured approach to email management can significantly boost productivity and focus, it's essential to remain adaptable. Some roles or situations might necessitate more frequent email checks or immediate responses to certain types of messages. The key is finding a balance that minimizes distractions while still fulfilling the demands of your role.

Adopting these strategies can lead to better control over your workday, allowing for more prolonged periods of concentrated work and ultimately improving your productivity and job satisfaction.

With the gmail app is there a way to only receive notifications for priority inbox?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-03-25 07:02:17*

Yes, in the Gmail app, you can customize your notification settings to only receive notifications for emails that land in your Priority Inbox. This feature helps you focus on important emails without being distracted by every new message that hits your inbox. Here's how you can set this up:

### For Android:
1. **Open the Gmail app** on your Android device.
2. **Tap on the three horizontal lines** in the top left to open the menu.
3. **Scroll down and tap on "Settings"**.
4. **Select the email account** you want to customize notifications for.
5. **Tap on "Notifications"** and choose **"High priority only"**.

This setting will ensure that you only receive notifications for emails that Gmail deems high priority, which is generally determined by factors like frequent correspondents and topics you often read or reply to.

### For iOS:
As of my last update, the iOS Gmail app's notification settings were more limited compared to Android. However, you could still manage your notifications through the Gmail app by adjusting how emails are categorized or by using the default Mail app on iOS with Gmail's IMAP settings to gain more granular control over notifications. Here's a general approach for iOS users wanting similar functionality:
1. **Use the Gmail app or web interface** to manage your Priority Inbox settings, ensuring it filters emails in a way that matches your needs.
2. **In the iOS Settings app**, go to Notifications > Gmail and adjust the notifications to your preference. You might need to explore using filters and labels in Gmail to manage which emails trigger notifications if the iOS app doesn't directly support "High priority only" notifications.

### Additional Tips:
- **Review your Priority Inbox settings** on the Gmail web interface to ensure it accurately reflects the types of emails you consider high priority.
- **Regularly check your other inboxes** to ensure you're not missing important emails that weren't marked as high priority.
- **Use filters and labels**: Create custom filters in Gmail to automatically label important emails, and adjust your notification settings to focus on these labels if needed.

Staying on top of your email settings and regularly refining them based on your changing priorities and workflow can help you maintain focus and productivity throughout your day.
