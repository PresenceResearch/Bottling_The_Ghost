An "Equity Emphasis Area" generally refers to a specific geographic or policy area where focused attention is placed to address disparities and inequalities, often in terms of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or other demographic factors. The goal in identifying and working within these areas is to ensure fair distribution of resources and opportunities and to improve outcomes for populations that have historically been marginalized or disadvantaged.

In urban planning and transportation, for example, an Equity Emphasis Area might be identified to prioritize investments in public transit, housing, or infrastructure that benefits underserved communities. In education, this term could refer to initiatives aimed at closing achievement gaps by providing additional support to schools in low-income areas.

These areas are identified through data analysis, which often includes indicators such as income levels, racial demographics, health outcomes, access to services, and more. Strategies to address inequities in these areas typically involve targeted policies, resource allocation, community engagement, and monitoring and evaluation to ensure effectiveness.
