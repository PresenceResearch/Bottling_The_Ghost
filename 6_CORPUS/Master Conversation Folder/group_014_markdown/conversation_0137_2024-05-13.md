The record you've shown is a vintage Columbia phonograph record, featuring a Ruthenian-Ukrainian folk song titled "Віщи Вітри, Потопай" (Whist Winds, Flow Down) with accordion accompaniment by Mr. and Mrs. J. Tokarenko. The label is marked with the serial number E-4516, and it was made in the USA as indicated by the Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc. label. The presence of accordion suggests a traditional folk arrangement, common in Ukrainian music, particularly for songs that are lyrical or narrative, often involving themes of nature, life's struggles, or folklore. This record likely dates back to the early to mid-20th century, reflecting a period when ethnic music from various immigrant communities in America was popularly recorded and distributed.

This record is another vintage Columbia phonograph record, featuring a Russian folk song titled "Выхожу один я на дорогу" (I Step Out Alone on the Road), famously known as "Накинув плащ" (Having Donned a Cloak) from its lyrics. The performer listed is D. Medoff, who provides tenor vocals, with accompaniment on violin, cello, and piano.

This song is particularly well-known in Russian culture, often associated with themes of solitude and reflection. The record is part of Columbia's Exclusive Artist series, suggesting that it was likely produced with high-quality standards to showcase prominent performers. The serial number on the label, E7459, can help date the record; based on similar Columbia record serials, it likely originates from the late 1920s or early 1930s, a period when Columbia was actively expanding its catalog of international music.

Based on the catalog number E7459 and comparing it with known Columbia Records catalog numbers from that era, this record is likely from the late 1920s to early 1930s. Columbia Records serial numbers from this time period followed a specific sequence which can often be correlated with production years, though pinpointing the exact year can sometimes be challenging without additional specific catalog information. However, given the style and context, the late 1920s or early 1930s is a reasonable estimate.
