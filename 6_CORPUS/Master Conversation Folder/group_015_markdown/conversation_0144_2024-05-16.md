This image shows the cover of a vinyl record titled "The Intimate Bach, Duets with the Spanish Guitar, Vol. 2" performed by Laurindo Almeida, with Virginia Majewski on viola and Vincent De Rosa on French horn. The cover art features a classical painting of three people in a lush, forest-like setting. A man plays guitar for two women; one listens intently while the other, dressed in a vibrant red and orange dress, reads sheet music. The painting is rich in detail and color, evoking a serene, artistic atmosphere typical of romantic classical themes.

What kind of French horn?  What make and model 

---

**Assistant:**

Vincent De Rosa is known for primarily playing a Holton H-179 Farkas Model French horn throughout his career. This model is widely recognized for its deep, rich tone and is a popular choice among professional horn players. It's likely that he used this or a similar model from Holton for his performances on recordings like "The Intimate Bach, Duets with the Spanish Guitar, Vol. 2."

Wasn’t it an 8D

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-05-16 19:36:38*

You're correct. Vincent De Rosa is famously associated with the Conn 8D French horn, which he helped popularize among professional horn players. The Conn 8D is known for its large, dark sound, suitable for the demands of both symphonic and studio work. It’s very likely that he used the Conn 8D on the album "The Intimate Bach, Duets with the Spanish Guitar, Vol. 2." My earlier mention of the Holton model was incorrect in this context. Thank you for pointing that out!
