Certainly! To create an Excel formula for calculating the cost of a solar panel system after considering the 30% federal tax credit and 60% bonus depreciation, we need to account for the initial cost of the system and then apply the tax benefits accordingly.

Let's assume the following:
- **Initial Cost of the Solar Panel System (C)**
- **Federal Tax Credit (FTC) = 30% of C**
- **Depreciable Basis = Initial Cost - Federal Tax Credit**
- **Bonus Depreciation = 60% of Depreciable Basis**
- **Net Cost after Tax Benefits**

Here's the step-by-step process to calculate the net cost after tax benefits:

1. Calculate the Federal Tax Credit (FTC):
   \[
   \text{FTC} = C \times 0.30
   \]

2. Calculate the Depreciable Basis:
   \[
   \text{Depreciable Basis} = C - \text{FTC}
   \]

3. Calculate the Bonus Depreciation:
   \[
   \text{Bonus Depreciation} = \text{Depreciable Basis} \times 0.60
   \]

4. Calculate the Net Cost after Tax Benefits:
   \[
   \text{Net Cost} = C - \text{FTC} - \text{Bonus Depreciation}
   \]

In Excel, assuming the initial cost of the solar panel system is in cell `A1`, the formulas would be:

1. Federal Tax Credit (FTC):
   ```excel
   =A1 * 0.30
   ```

2. Depreciable Basis:
   ```excel
   =A1 - (A1 * 0.30)
   ```

3. Bonus Depreciation:
   ```excel
   =(A1 - (A1 * 0.30)) * 0.60
   ```

4. Net Cost after Tax Benefits:
   ```excel
   =A1 - (A1 * 0.30) - ((A1 - (A1 * 0.30)) * 0.60)
   ```

Combining these into a single formula for the Net Cost:

```excel
=A1 - (A1 * 0.30) - ((A1 - (A1 * 0.30)) * 0.60)
```

This formula will give you the net cost of the solar panel system after accounting for the 30% federal tax credit and 60% bonus depreciation.
