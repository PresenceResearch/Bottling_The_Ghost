Planting a knockout rose bush involves several steps to ensure it thrives. Here's a guide to help you:

### Choosing the Right Location
1. **Sunlight**: Select a spot that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
2. **Soil**: Ensure the soil is well-draining and rich in organic matter. Amend the soil with compost if needed.

### Planting Steps
1. **Timing**: The best time to plant knockout roses is in the spring or fall when temperatures are mild.
2. **Preparation**: 
   - Dig a hole twice as wide and as deep as the rose’s root ball.
   - Mix some compost into the soil you removed from the hole.
3. **Planting**:
   - Remove the rose from its container and gently loosen the roots.
   - Place the rose in the hole, ensuring the root ball is level with or slightly above the ground surface.
   - Fill the hole with the amended soil, pressing down gently to remove air pockets.
4. **Watering**:
   - Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil.
   - Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the first growing season.
5. **Mulching**: 
   - Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around the base of the plant to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
6. **Fertilizing**:
   - Fertilize after the initial bloom cycle and then once a month during the growing season with a balanced rose fertilizer.
7. **Pruning**:
   - Prune in early spring before new growth begins to shape the plant and remove any dead or damaged wood.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Watering**: Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry spells. Avoid overhead watering to reduce the risk of disease.
- **Pest and Disease Control**: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids and diseases like black spot. Treat as necessary with appropriate organic or chemical controls.

Following these steps will help you establish a healthy and beautiful knockout rose bush in your garden.
