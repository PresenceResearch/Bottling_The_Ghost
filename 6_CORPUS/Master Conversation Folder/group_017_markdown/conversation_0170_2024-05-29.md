To calculate the 5-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) depreciation for a solar system, you can follow these steps. MACRS allows for accelerated depreciation, which means a larger portion of the asset’s cost is depreciated in the earlier years. For a 5-year property, the applicable percentages are based on the IRS MACRS tables.

Here's a breakdown of the percentages for a 5-year property using the 200% declining balance method, switching to the straight-line method when beneficial:

- Year 1: 20.00%
- Year 2: 32.00%
- Year 3: 19.20%
- Year 4: 11.52%
- Year 5: 11.52%
- Year 6: 5.76%

To illustrate the calculation, let's assume the cost of the solar system is $60,000.

1. **Year 1:**
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 60,000 \times 0.20 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Year 2:**
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 60,000 \times 0.32 = 19,200
   \]

3. **Year 3:**
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 60,000 \times 0.192 = 11,520
   \]

4. **Year 4:**
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 60,000 \times 0.1152 = 6,912
   \]

5. **Year 5:**
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 60,000 \times 0.1152 = 6,912
   \]

6. **Year 6:**
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 60,000 \times 0.0576 = 3,456
   \]

Now, let's compile these calculations into a table:

| Year | Depreciation Percentage | Depreciation Amount ($) |
|------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1    | 20.00%                   | 12,000                  |
| 2    | 32.00%                   | 19,200                  |
| 3    | 19.20%                   | 11,520                  |
| 4    | 11.52%                   | 6,912                   |
| 5    | 11.52%                   | 6,912                   |
| 6    | 5.76%                    | 3,456                   |

The total depreciation amount should equal the cost of the solar system, which is $60,000.

please calculate depreciation for solar system costing $2,114,437.50 utilizing the 60% bonus depreciation model

---

**Assistant:**

To calculate the depreciation for a solar system costing $2,114,437.50 using the 60% bonus depreciation model along with the MACRS 5-year schedule, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the 60% bonus depreciation:**
   \[
   \text{Bonus Depreciation} = 2,114,437.50 \times 0.60 = 1,268,662.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining basis to be depreciated using the MACRS 5-year schedule:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Basis} = 2,114,437.50 - 1,268,662.50 = 845,775.00
   \]

3. **Apply the MACRS 5-year schedule percentages to the remaining basis:**

- Year 1: 20.00%
- Year 2: 32.00%
- Year 3: 19.20%
- Year 4: 11.52%
- Year 5: 11.52%
- Year 6: 5.76%

### Yearly Depreciation Calculation:

**Year 1:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 845,775.00 \times 0.20 = 169,155.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Year 1 Depreciation} = 1,268,662.50 (\text{bonus}) + 169,155.00 = 1,437,817.50
   \]

**Year 2:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 845,775.00 \times 0.32 = 270,648.00
   \]

**Year 3:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 845,775.00 \times 0.192 = 162,383.40
   \]

**You:**

please consider that project takes 30% federal tax credit year 1

---

**Assistant:**

To incorporate the 30% federal tax credit in the first year, we need to adjust the initial cost of the solar system by the tax credit amount before applying the bonus depreciation and MACRS schedule.

Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate the 30% federal tax credit:**
   \[
   \text{Federal Tax Credit} = 2,114,437.50 \times 0.30 = 634,331.25
   \]

2. **Subtract the tax credit from the initial cost to get the adjusted basis:**
   \[
   \text{Adjusted Basis} = 2,114,437.50 - 634,331.25 = 1,480,106.25
   \]

3. **Calculate the 60% bonus depreciation on the adjusted basis:**
   \[
   \text{Bonus Depreciation} = 1,480,106.25 \times 0.60 = 888,063.75
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining basis to be depreciated using the MACRS 5-year schedule:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Basis} = 1,480,106.25 - 888,063.75 = 592,042.50
   \]

5. **Apply the MACRS 5-year schedule percentages to the remaining basis:**

- Year 1: 20.00%
- Year 2: 32.00%
- Year 3: 19.20%
- Year 4: 11.52%
- Year 5: 11.52%
- Year 6: 5.76%

### Yearly Depreciation Calculation:

**Year 1:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 592,042.50 \times 0.20 = 118,408.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Year 1 Depreciation} = 888,063.75 (\text{bonus}) + 118,408.50 = 1,006,472.25
   \]

**Year 2:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 592,042.50 \times 0.32 = 189,453.60
   \]

**Year 3:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 592,042.50 \times 0.192 = 113,682.16
   \]

**Year 4:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 592,042.50 \times 0.1152 = 68,174.49
   \]

**Year 5:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 592,042.50 \times 0.1152 = 68,174.49
   \]

**Year 6:**
   \[
   \text{MACRS Depreciation} = 592,042.50 \times 0.0576 = 34,087.24
   \]

### Depreciation Schedule:

| Year | Depreciation Percentage | Depreciation Amount ($) |
|------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1    | 60% + 20.00%             | 1,006,472.25            |
| 2    | 32.00%                   | 189,453.60              |
| 3    | 19.20%                   | 113,682.16              |
| 4    | 11.52%                   | 68,174.49               |
| 5    | 11.52%                   | 68,174.49               |
| 6    | 5.76%                    | 34,087.24               |
