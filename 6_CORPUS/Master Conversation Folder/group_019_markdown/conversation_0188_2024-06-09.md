To clean spray foam insulation off your fingers, follow these steps:

1. **Act Quickly:** If the foam is still wet, you can try to wipe it off immediately with a paper towel or a cloth.

2. **Use a Solvent:** For wet foam, you can use a solvent such as acetone (found in nail polish remover) or a specific spray foam cleaner. Be cautious with acetone as it can be harsh on the skin.

3. **Warm Soapy Water:** Wash your hands with warm soapy water to remove as much of the foam as possible.

4. **Pumice Stone or Abrasive Pad:** If the foam has dried, use a pumice stone or an abrasive pad to gently rub off the dried foam. Be careful not to irritate your skin.

5. **Moisturize:** After removing the foam, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, then apply a moisturizer to soothe your skin.

Remember to always wear gloves when working with spray foam insulation to prevent this issue in the future.
