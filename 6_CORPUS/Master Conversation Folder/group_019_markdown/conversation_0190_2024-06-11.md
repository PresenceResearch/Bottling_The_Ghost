Ah, I see! States don't typically close entirely, but specific services or offices might be closed for holidays or specific events. Let me check if there's a holiday or event affecting Illinois today. I'll find that information for you.

Illinois is not closed today. There are no state holidays or specific events on June eleventh that would cause the entire state to shut down. Government offices and services should be operating as usual. However, certain city offices, like those in Chicago, might have their own schedules for holidays and closures, but June eleventh is not one of those days.

For further details on specific closures or holidays, you can refer to the Illinois Department of Central Management Services website and the City of Chicago's holiday schedule.

Chicago O'Hare International Airport is not closed today, but there are some disruptions. There are minor delays for both arrivals and departures, with gate hold and taxi delays lasting around fifteen minutes or less【16†source】【18†source】. Additionally, there are protests near Terminal 1 that are causing significant traffic delays on the roads leading to the airport. The Illinois State Police and Chicago Police Department are managing the situation, but it might take longer to reach the airport by car【19†source】.
