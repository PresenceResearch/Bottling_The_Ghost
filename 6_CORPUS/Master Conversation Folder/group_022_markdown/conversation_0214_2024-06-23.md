### Recommendations for Historical Fiction about Japanese History:

1. **"Shōgun" by James Clavell** - A sweeping saga set in feudal Japan, this novel follows an English sailor who becomes embroiled in the political and cultural conflicts of 17th-century Japan. It's rich in historical detail and offers a compelling story.

2. **"The Tale of Genji" by Murasaki Shikibu** - Often considered the world's first novel, this classic work provides a detailed depiction of court life in Heian-era Japan. While not a modern historical fiction, it offers deep insights into Japanese culture and history.

3. **"Memoirs of a Geisha" by Arthur Golden** - This novel provides a fascinating look at the life of a geisha in the early 20th century, weaving historical events with a compelling personal narrative.

### Recommendations for Learning about World War II from the Japanese Perspective:

1. **"Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II" by John W. Dower** - This Pulitzer Prize-winning book examines the impact of World War II on Japan and its people, focusing on the immediate aftermath of the war.

2. **"Hiroshima" by John Hersey** - This classic work provides a harrowing account of the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, told through the stories of six survivors.

3. **"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" by Haruki Murakami** - While not strictly a historical novel, this book weaves elements of Japan's wartime history into its narrative, offering a unique perspective on the impact of the war on Japanese society.

4. **"Japan at War: An Oral History" by Haruko Taya Cook and Theodore F. Cook** - This book offers a collection of first-hand accounts from Japanese soldiers, civilians, and officials, providing a deeply personal perspective on the war.

These books should provide a broad and engaging introduction to Japanese history and World War II from a Japanese perspective.
