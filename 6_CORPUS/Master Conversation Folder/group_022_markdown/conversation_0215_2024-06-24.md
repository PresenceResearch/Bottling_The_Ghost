In Baltimore County, commercial solar installations must adhere to specific setback requirements as part of the zoning and permitting process.

For ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, a clear area of at least 10 feet around the installation must be provided. Additionally, a gravel or other non-combustible base must be installed and maintained under and around the installation to mitigate fire hazards and ensure safety.

For roof-mounted systems, the setback requirements are designed to ensure firefighter access and ventilation opportunities. These include maintaining a minimum six-foot clear perimeter along the edge of the roof. If the building length on either axis is 250 feet or less, this perimeter can be reduced to a minimum of four feet.

These setback requirements are part of the broader zoning regulations and building codes that Baltimore County enforces to ensure the safety and effectiveness of solar installations. For detailed and up-to-date information, you can refer to the [Baltimore County Zoning Regulations](https://library.municode.com/md/baltimore_county/codes/zoning_regulations) and the [Solar Photovoltaic System Installations guidelines](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/permits/permitsreview/solarpv.html) on the Baltimore County Government website.

In Baltimore County, there is no specific size limit for roof-mounted solar arrays. However, there are important structural and safety requirements that must be met.

1. **Structural Integrity**: The roof and its supporting structure must be capable of handling the additional load of the solar panels. This includes ensuring that the combined weight of the modules and support components does not exceed the building’s capacity.

2. **Firefighter Access and Safety**: Regulations mandate clear access pathways on the roof. For commercial buildings, this typically includes maintaining a minimum six-foot clear perimeter along the edge of the roof. If the building length on either axis is 250 feet or less, this perimeter can be reduced to a minimum of four feet. Additionally, pathways between arrays must be at least four feet wide to ensure safe access for firefighters.

3. **Permitting and Compliance**: A detailed review and approval process is required for all solar installations. This includes submitting detailed plans that demonstrate compliance with local building codes and safety standards.

These guidelines ensure that while there is flexibility in the size of roof-mounted solar arrays, safety and structural integrity are not compromised. For detailed and up-to-date information, you can refer to the Baltimore County Government’s [Solar Photovoltaic System Installations guidelines](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/permits/permitsreview/solarpv.html) and the [Baltimore County Zoning Regulations](https://library.municode.com/md/baltimore_county/codes/zoning_regulations)【6†source】【7†source】【15†source】【17†source】【18†source】.
