I have two solar systems.  One of them is 362.3 kW and one of them is 49.9 kW.  The production factor on the 362.3 kW system is 1336 and the production factor on the 49.9 kW is 1336.  My financier offered $5.26 per watt on the 362.3 kW system and $3.00 per watt on the 49.9 kW system.  The $3.00 price is at cost.  The total system size combined is 412.4 kW and the total price is $2,055,398.  If the 49.9 kW system is removed, how much should the new purchase price on the 362.3 kW system be to match the same project economics

To determine the new purchase price for the 362.3 kW system to maintain the same project economics without the 49.9 kW system, we need to consider the following:

1. Calculate the current combined price per watt.
2. Determine the new price per watt for the 362.3 kW system to keep the overall economics unchanged.

### Step 1: Calculate the Current Combined Price per Watt
The total system size combined is 412.4 kW, and the total price is $2,055,398.

\[ \text{Current combined price per watt} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Total system size}} \]

\[ \text{Current combined price per watt} = \frac{2,055,398}{412,400} \]

\[ \text{Current combined price per watt} = \$4.98 \]

### Step 2: Determine the New Purchase Price for the 362.3 kW System

To match the same project economics, we need the 362.3 kW system to maintain the same price per watt of $4.98.

\[ \text{New purchase price for the 362.3 kW system} = \text{New system size} \times \text{Current combined price per watt} \]

\[ \text{New purchase price for the 362.3 kW system} = 362,300 \times 4.98 \]

\[ \text{New purchase price for the 362.3 kW system} = 1,804,254 \]

Therefore, the new purchase price for the 362.3 kW system should be $1,804,254 to match the same project economics.

why would the financier offer me $4.90?  what would be the justification behind that offer

---

**Assistant:**

The financier's offer of $4.90 per watt for the 362.3 kW system could be justified by several factors related to the cost structure, risk, and overall financing strategy. Here are some potential reasons for this offer:

### 1. **Economies of Scale:**
Larger systems often benefit from economies of scale, leading to a lower cost per watt. The financier might have calculated that the 362.3 kW system, being significantly larger than the 49.9 kW system, should inherently have a lower cost per watt due to more efficient procurement and installation processes.

### 2. **Financier's Cost Structure:**
The financier might have lower overall costs for the 362.3 kW system, including bulk purchasing discounts on equipment, reduced labor costs per unit, or other operational efficiencies.

### 3. **Profit Margins:**
For the smaller system (49.9 kW), the financier might have less room to lower the price due to fixed costs and minimum profit margins that need to be maintained. The $3.00 per watt offer for the smaller system being at cost indicates that the financier is already minimizing their profit margin on that system.

### 4. **Risk Mitigation:**
Larger systems might be seen as less risky or more attractive investments due to their higher energy production and revenue generation potential. The financier might be willing to offer a better rate per watt on the larger system to secure a more substantial and potentially lower-risk project.

### 5. **Competitive Pricing:**
The financier might be offering $4.90 per watt to make the deal more attractive and competitive compared to other potential offers you might receive. By providing a better rate, they increase the likelihood of securing your business.

### 6. **Financing Terms and Conditions:**
There might be specific terms and conditions attached to the financing of the 362.3 kW system that allow for a lower rate per watt. For example, longer-term financing agreements, better credit terms, or other financial products tied to the larger system could justify the lower offer.

### 7. **Market Conditions:**
Market conditions, including supply chain factors, demand for solar projects, and regional incentives, could impact the pricing strategy. The financier might be responding to these external factors to remain competitive or align with industry standards.

In summary, the offer of $4.90 per watt likely reflects a combination of cost efficiencies, risk assessment, and strategic pricing by the financier to secure the project while maintaining their profitability and competitiveness in the market.

the $3.00 per watt is cost with no markup, so the $5.26 contains markup for the whole project.  Would this have an effect on the $.09 difference?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-06-27 16:21:08*

The fact that the $3.00 per watt price for the 49.9 kW system is at cost with no markup, while the $5.26 per watt price for the 362.3 kW system includes a markup, does indeed affect the $0.09 per watt difference. Here’s a more detailed analysis:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Current Costs and Markups:**
   - **49.9 kW System:** Cost at $3.00 per watt (no markup).
   - **362.3 kW System:** Cost at $5.26 per watt (including markup).

2. **Determine Markup on 362.3 kW System:**
   - To understand the markup included in the $5.26 per watt, we need to estimate the base cost. Let’s assume a certain markup percentage for simplicity, but it’s important to remember the financier's overall goal to maintain profit margins.

3. **Calculate the Impact of Removing the 49.9 kW System:**
   - Combined System Size: 412.4 kW.
   - Combined System Price: $2,055,398.
   - Combined Price per Watt: $4.98.
   
4. **Recalculate the Price per Watt Without the 49.9 kW System:**
   - New System Size: 362.3 kW.
   - If we aim to maintain the same overall project economics (price per watt of $4.98), the new purchase price needs to match this value.
   - Target Price per Watt for 362.3 kW: $4.98.
   
5. **Comparison with Financier's Offer:**
   - Financier's Offered Price: $4.90 per watt.
   - Target Price per Watt to Match Project Economics: $4.98 per watt.
   - Difference: $0.08 per watt.

### Reason for the Difference:
The $0.08 difference (slightly adjusted from the previous $0.09) can be attributed to the following:

- **Markup Adjustment:** The original $5.26 per watt includes a significant markup that compensates for both systems together. When the smaller system is removed, the financier might reduce the markup on the larger system to make the offer more attractive, thereby offering $4.90 per watt instead of maintaining the same level of markup.
- **Volume Discount:** By focusing solely on the larger system, the financier might apply a more aggressive volume discount, reflecting the efficiencies of installing a single, larger system.
- **Market Strategy:** Offering a competitive price per watt for the larger system alone can make the proposal more compelling, potentially securing the financier a larger and more lucrative contract.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the fact that the $3.00 per watt price for the smaller system is at cost with no markup affects the overall pricing strategy. The financier's offer of $4.90 per watt likely reflects an adjusted markup strategy to remain competitive and attractive, factoring in the removal of the smaller system. This adjustment is aimed at balancing profitability while maintaining a compelling offer for the larger 362.3 kW system.

To understand how the decrease in the price per watt for the 362.3 kW system allows the financier to meet the same rate of return as the original project, let's break down the financial aspects and implications:

### Original Project Economics

1. **Combined System Size and Costs:**
   - Total System Size: 412.4 kW
   - Total Project Cost: $2,055,398
   - Average Cost per Watt: $4.98

2. **Individual System Costs:**
   - **49.9 kW System:** 
     - Cost per Watt: $3.00
     - Total Cost: $3.00 * 49,900 = $149,700
   - **362.3 kW System:** 
     - Cost per Watt: $5.26
     - Total Cost: $5.26 * 362,300 = $1,905,698

### Adjusted Project Economics Without the 49.9 kW System

1. **New System Size:**
   - 362.3 kW

2. **Financier's Offered Price:**
   - Cost per Watt: $4.90
   - New Total Cost: $4.90 * 362,300 = $1,775,270

### Maintaining the Same Rate of Return

The financier needs to ensure that the rate of return (ROI) on the investment remains the same despite the change in system size and pricing. ROI is generally influenced by the total project cost, expected revenue, and financing terms. Let's explore this with the financial numbers:

#### Calculating Expected Revenue and ROI

**Original Project:**
- Combined Cost: $2,055,398
- Average Production Factor: 1336 kWh per kW
- Total Energy Production: 412.4 kW * 1336 = 550,206.4 kWh per year
- Assume a revenue rate per kWh (R) and a desired ROI (D).

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 550,206.4 \times R \]
\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{Combined Cost}}{\text{Combined Cost}} \]

**Adjusted Project:**
- New Cost: $1,775,270
- Total Energy Production: 362.3 kW * 1336 = 484,272.8 kWh per year

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 484,272.8 \times R \]
\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{New Cost}}{\text{New Cost}} \]

### Ensuring Equal ROI

To ensure the ROI remains the same, the new project needs to have an equivalent or better financial performance. This includes:

1. **Lower Project Cost:**
   By reducing the cost per watt to $4.90, the financier decreases the total project cost from $1,905,698 to $1,775,270 for the 362.3 kW system. This reduction helps balance the lower total energy production and maintain profitability.

2. **Proportional Revenue Generation:**
   The decrease in cost per watt helps to keep the cost-to-revenue ratio in line with the original project. The financier's offer of $4.90 per watt ensures that the overall investment remains attractive, and the revenue generated by the larger system is sufficient to meet the desired ROI.

#### Financial Analysis:

For the original combined project:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 550,206.4 \times R \]
\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{(550,206.4 \times R) - 2,055,398}{2,055,398} \]

For the new single system project:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 484,272.8 \times R \]
\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{(484,272.8 \times R) - 1,775,270}{1,775,270} \]

By offering the 362.3 kW system at $4.90 per watt, the financier ensures that the reduction in total project cost aligns with the expected revenue, keeping the ROI consistent. The lower price compensates for the smaller system size, balancing the overall financial returns to match the original project's economics.
