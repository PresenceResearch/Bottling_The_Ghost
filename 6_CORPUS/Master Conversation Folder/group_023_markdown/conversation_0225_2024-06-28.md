No, Barack Obama cannot run for president again. The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Barack Obama has already served two terms as President, from 2009 to 2017, so he is ineligible to run for the presidency again.

As of now, President Joe Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election. He has consistently led in polls with a significant margin over potential challengers. 

However, should Biden decide not to run, several other Democrats are considered potential candidates:

1. **Gretchen Whitmer**: The Governor of Michigan is viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party. She has garnered national attention and has been encouraged by many within the party to consider a presidential run【10†source】.

2. **Gavin Newsom**: The Governor of California has also been mentioned as a potential candidate. Although he has publicly stated he has no interest in running, his actions suggest he might be positioning himself for a future bid【10†source】.

3. **Pete Buttigieg**: The current Secretary of Transportation and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was a strong contender in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He remains a popular figure within the party and could be a significant candidate if Biden doesn't run【10†source】.

4. **J.B. Pritzker**: The Governor of Illinois, though having ruled out challenging Biden directly, has been expanding his national profile and could be a contender if Biden steps aside【10†source】.

Other potential candidates include Vice President Kamala Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Michelle Obama, though the latter has repeatedly expressed no desire to run for office【9†source】【10†source】. 

Overall, the Democratic field remains largely focused on Biden for now, but these figures could emerge as frontrunners if the landscape changes.

Given the current landscape, President Joe Biden has the best chance of winning the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election. He is the incumbent president and leads significantly in polls against potential challengers【8†source】【9†source】.

If Biden decides not to run, the field becomes more open. Among the potential candidates, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom are seen as strong contenders due to their national profiles and political successes. Pete Buttigieg also remains a notable figure with significant support within the party【10†source】.

Ultimately, the best chance of winning will depend on several factors, including Biden's decision to run, the political climate closer to the election, and the ability of other candidates to mobilize support and present a compelling vision for the future.
