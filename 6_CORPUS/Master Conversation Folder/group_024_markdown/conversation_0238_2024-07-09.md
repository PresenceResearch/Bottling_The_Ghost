To find out how many kilowatt hours (kWh) it would take to equal $15,000 when the value of 1 kWh is 17.4 cents, you can use the following steps:

1. Convert 17.4 cents to dollars:  
\[ 17.4 \text{ cents} = 0.174 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Divide $15,000 by the value of 1 kWh:  
\[ \text{kWh} = \frac{15,000 \text{ dollars}}{0.174 \text{ dollars per kWh}} \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ \text{kWh} = \frac{15,000}{0.174} \approx 86,206.9 \]

So, it would take approximately 86,207 kWh to equal $15,000.
