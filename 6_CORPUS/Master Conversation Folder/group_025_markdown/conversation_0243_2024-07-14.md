The metal in the photo appears to be some type of steel or iron that has become rusty. To remove the rust, you can follow these steps:

### Materials Needed:
1. White vinegar or lemon juice
2. Baking soda (optional)
3. A small brush (such as an old toothbrush)
4. A soft cloth or sponge
5. Water
6. Protective gloves (optional)

### Steps to Remove Rust:

1. **Soak in Vinegar or Lemon Juice:**
   - Submerge the rusty parts of the buckle in white vinegar or lemon juice. These acidic solutions will help to dissolve the rust. Let it soak for several hours or overnight if the rust is severe.

2. **Scrub the Rust:**
   - After soaking, use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away the rust. The rust should come off more easily after soaking.

3. **Use Baking Soda (Optional):**
   - For any remaining rust, you can make a paste with baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the rusted area and scrub again with the brush.

4. **Rinse and Dry:**
   - Rinse the metal thoroughly with water to remove any residue from the vinegar, lemon juice, or baking soda.
   - Dry the metal completely with a soft cloth to prevent new rust from forming.

5. **Protect the Metal:**
   - To prevent future rusting, you can apply a thin layer of mineral oil or another protective coating.

### Tips:
- If the rust is very stubborn, you might need to repeat the soaking and scrubbing process.
- Always dry the metal completely after cleaning to prevent new rust from forming.
