a 98.7 kW commercial solar system was sold to an investor for $239,990.49.  Guaranteed annual output is 85% of 127,801 kW.  The size of the system has changed from 98.7 kW to 93.15 kW however the system is more efficient and the new guaranteed output is 85% of 121,700.  The PPA rate that the investor is charging the host is $.137/kWh.  Reducing the price of the system pro-rata $/Watt misrepresents the true value of the system.  Can you calculate a new price the investor will pay for the solar system based on the difference in production and not in the difference of system size?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-15 19:20:36*

To calculate the new price the investor will pay for the solar system based on the difference in production, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{Original guaranteed annual output} = 85\% \times 127,801 \text{ kWh} = 0.85 \times 127,801 = 108,630.85 \text{ kWh}
   \]

2. **Determine the new guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{New guaranteed annual output} = 85\% \times 121,700 \text{ kWh} = 0.85 \times 121,700 = 103,445 \text{ kWh}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{Difference in output} = 108,630.85 \text{ kWh} - 103,445 \text{ kWh} = 5,185.85 \text{ kWh}
   \]

4. **Determine the value of the lost production based on the PPA rate:**
   \[
   \text{Value of lost production} = 5,185.85 \text{ kWh} \times \$0.137/\text{kWh} = \$710.48
   \]

5. **Adjust the original price of the system by subtracting the value of the lost production:**
   \[
   \text{New price} = \$239,990.49 - \$710.48 = \$239,280.01
   \]

Thus, the new price the investor will pay for the solar system, based on the difference in production and not the difference in system size, is \$239,280.01.

can you please also include the lost revenue from MAryland SREC's using the new valuation schedule?

**Assistant:**

To include the lost revenue from Maryland SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Certificates), we need to calculate the number of SRECs lost due to the reduction in production and then determine their value based on the new valuation schedule.

Assuming the new valuation schedule for Maryland SRECs is provided or can be determined, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the lost production in kWh (already determined):**
   \[
   \text{Difference in output} = 5,185.85 \text{ kWh}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of SRECs lost:**
   In Maryland, 1 SREC is typically earned for every 1,000 kWh of solar energy produced.
   \[
   \text{SRECs lost} = \frac{5,185.85 \text{ kWh}}{1,000 \text{ kWh/SREC}} = 5.18585 \text{ SRECs}
   \]

3. **Determine the value of one SREC based on the new valuation schedule:**
   For this calculation, let's assume the new valuation schedule values each SREC at $75 (the actual value may vary).

4. **Calculate the lost revenue from SRECs:**
   \[
   \text{Lost revenue from SRECs} = 5.18585 \text{ SRECs} \times \$75/\text{SREC} = \$388.94
   \]

5. **Adjust the original price of the system by subtracting both the value of the lost production and the lost SREC revenue:**
   \[
   \text{New price} = \$239,990.49 - \$710.48 - \$388.94 = \$238,891.07
   \]

Thus, the new price the investor will pay for the solar system, including the lost revenue from Maryland SRECs, is \$238,891.07.

can you calculate the value of the original system's output utilising the pre july 1st MAryland SREC valuation schedule and then compare the two overall economics?  does the increase in projected SREC revenue compensate for the loss in production?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-15 19:23:33*

To compare the overall economics of the original system and the new system, we need to evaluate the SREC revenues before and after the change. We will use the Maryland SREC valuation schedule for both periods: pre-July 1st and post-July 1st. Let's assume some specific values for the SREC rates before and after July 1st for this comparison.

### Assumptions:
- **Pre-July 1st SREC valuation:** $50 per SREC
- **Post-July 1st SREC valuation:** $75 per SREC
- **PPA rate:** $0.137 per kWh

### Calculations:

#### 1. Original System (98.7 kW)

1. **Original guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{Original guaranteed annual output} = 85\% \times 127,801 \text{ kWh} = 108,630.85 \text{ kWh}
   \]

2. **SRECs generated by the original system (pre-July 1st valuation):**
   \[
   \text{SRECs generated} = \frac{108,630.85 \text{ kWh}}{1,000 \text{ kWh/SREC}} = 108.63085 \text{ SRECs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of SRECs} = 108.63085 \text{ SRECs} \times \$50/\text{SREC} = \$5,431.54
   \]

3. **Total revenue from the original system:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from PPA} = 108,630.85 \text{ kWh} \times \$0.137/\text{kWh} = \$14,875.43
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$14,875.43 + \$5,431.54 = \$20,306.97
   \]

#### 2. New System (93.15 kW)

1. **New guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{New guaranteed annual output} = 85\% \times 121,700 \text{ kWh} = 103,445 \text{ kWh}
   \]

2. **SRECs generated by the new system (post-July 1st valuation):**
   \[
   \text{SRECs generated} = \frac{103,445 \text{ kWh}}{1,000 \text{ kWh/SREC}} = 103.445 \text{ SRECs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of SRECs} = 103.445 \text{ SRECs} \times \$75/\text{SREC} = \$7,758.38
   \]

3. **Total revenue from the new system:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from PPA} = 103,445 \text{ kWh} \times \$0.137/\text{kWh} = \$14,165.97
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$14,165.97 + \$7,758.38 = \$21,924.35
   \]

#### 3. Comparison of Economics

- **Original system total revenue:** \$20,306.97
- **New system total revenue:** \$21,924.35

### Analysis:

The total revenue from the new system is higher than the total revenue from the original system, even though the new system has lower production. The increase in SREC valuation from \$50 to \$75 per SREC has compensated for the loss in production.

#### Conclusion:
Yes, the increase in projected SREC revenue compensates for the loss in production, resulting in higher overall revenue for the new system compared to the original system.

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-15 19:26:59*

To perform the same analysis for the new system, we'll follow the same steps as before.

### Assumptions:
- **Pre-July 1st SREC valuation:** $50 per SREC

- **Original guaranteed annual output:** 85% of 127,801 kWh
- **New system size:** 93.6 kW
- **New guaranteed annual output:** 85% of 121,700 kWh

### Calculations:

#### 1. Original System (100.8 kW)

1. **Original guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{Original guaranteed annual output} = 85\% \times 127,801 \text{ kWh} = 108,630.85 \text{ kWh}
   \]

2. **SRECs generated by the original system (pre-July 1st valuation):**
   \[
   \text{SRECs generated} = \frac{108,630.85 \text{ kWh}}{1,000 \text{ kWh/SREC}} = 108.63085 \text{ SRECs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of SRECs} = 108.63085 \text{ SRECs} \times \$50/\text{SREC} = \$5,431.54
   \]

3. **Total revenue from the original system:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from PPA} = 108,630.85 \text{ kWh} \times \$0.137/\text{kWh} = \$14,875.43
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$14,875.43 + \$5,431.54 = \$20,306.97
   \]

#### 2. New System (93.6 kW)

1. **New guaranteed annual output:**
   \[
   \text{New guaranteed annual output} = 85\% \times 121,700 \text{ kWh} = 103,445 \text{ kWh}
   \]

2. **SRECs generated by the new system (post-July 1st valuation):**
   \[
   \text{SRECs generated} = \frac{103,445 \text{ kWh}}{1,000 \text{ kWh/SREC}} = 103.445 \text{ SRECs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of SRECs} = 103.445 \text{ SRECs} \times \$75/\text{SREC} = \$7,758.38
   \]

3. **Total revenue from the new system:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from PPA} = 103,445 \text{ kWh} \times \$0.137/\text{kWh} = \$14,165.97
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$14,165.97 + \$7,758.38 = \$21,924.35
   \]

### Comparison of Economics

- **Original system total revenue:** \$20,306.97
- **New system total revenue:** \$21,924.35

### Analysis:

The total revenue from the new system is higher than the total revenue from the original system, even though the new system has lower production. The increase in SREC valuation from \$50 to \$75 per SREC has compensated for the loss in production.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the increase in projected SREC revenue compensates for the loss in production, resulting in higher overall revenue for the new system compared to the original system, for this separate system as well.
