**You:**

can you make this sound better?  I am writing a contract with a lead generation company and I want to include a clause stating that the meeting needs to be with a decision maker or someone at least directly involved in the decision making process.  "Point of Contact will be in a decision-making capacity.  Lumina understands that this can be difficult to ascertain during the initial interaction however Lumina expects Lead Generator to avoid scheduling meetings with individuals which are not actively participating in the decision making process"

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-23 12:44:51*

Sure, here's a revised version of the clause for your contract:

---

**Point of Contact Requirement:** The scheduled meeting must involve an individual with decision-making authority or someone directly involved in the decision-making process. While Lumina acknowledges that identifying such individuals may be challenging during initial interactions, Lumina expects the Lead Generator to make reasonable efforts to avoid scheduling meetings with individuals who are not actively participating in the decision-making process.

Feel free to adjust any specifics to better suit your needs!

can you elaborate on each point sightly

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-23 12:51:55*

Certainly! Here's the revised version with each point elaborated:

---

**Site Requirements for Solar Panel Installation:**

- **Clear Rooftop:** The rooftop must be free of significant obstructions, such as HVAC units, large vents, or other equipment, that would interfere with the proper installation and operation of solar panels.
  
- **Shading-Free Roof:** The roof(s) must not have obstructions such as tall trees, nearby buildings, or other structures that cause shading throughout the day, as this would render it unsuitable for solar panel installations by reducing efficiency and energy output.
  
- **Minimum Roof Size:** The roof(s) must have a minimum surface area of XXX square feet to ensure sufficient space for installing the required number of solar panels to meet energy production goals.
  
- **Location within Territory:** The site must be located within the geographic territory outlined in Exhibit A. This ensures that the site falls within the serviceable area and complies with local regulations and incentives.
  
- **Nonviable Green Roofs:** Sites with green roofs, which are covered with vegetation, are nonviable for solar panel installations. The presence of plant life and soil can complicate installation and affect the performance and maintenance of the solar panels.
