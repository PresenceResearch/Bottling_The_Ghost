**Notice!**

Observe the user manual for the cipher machine (H. Dv. g. 13).

1. For cleaning the roller contacts, turn all rollers several times back and forth.
2. For cleaning the key contacts, press all keys several times before turning on the power, pressing down hard and releasing, with one key remaining constantly pressed.
3. When setting the characters visible in the windows, make sure the rollers are correctly engaged.
4. The non-interchangeable double-pole plugs must be inserted into their respective pairs of sockets up to the stop. The front wooden flap must then be closed, as otherwise, 3 lamps can light up simultaneously.
5. If no lamp lights up when a key is pressed, check the battery, its contact springs, its connections to the switch and the switch itself.
6. If one or more lamps light up when a key is pressed, check the corresponding lamps, their contacts underneath, the cables of the double-pole plugs, the plug sockets including their short-circuit plates, the roller contacts, the working contacts of the keys pressed and the rest contacts under them with the corresponding keys, and clean and lubricate any existing contamination and oxidation. (See also point 2.)
7. The machine No. A 4388 serves for lamp testing by opening the right lamp field side. The machine No. A 4388 also serves for cable testing by inserting the outer left and right sockets of the middle row into the plug tester and the cable tester on the left lamp field side.
8. Roller axes and roller sockets should be kept clean and greased with resin-free and acid-free oil every 6–8 weeks with polishing paper. The fixed contacts of the rollers should be rubbed with a little oil applied to paper. The key contacts, the lamp contacts, and the short-circuit plates should be protected from oil.

Key specifications are either through numbers or letters.
To convert numbers to letters, the following table is used:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
