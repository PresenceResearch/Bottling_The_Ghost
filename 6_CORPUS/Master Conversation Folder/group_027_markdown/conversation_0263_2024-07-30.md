I am receiving $40,000 per mW for a 3.292 mW community Solar system annually with a 2% annual increase.  Can you create a table with the 20 year payout year oer year

**Assistant:**

I have created a table that shows the 20-year payout year over year for the 3.292 MW community solar system. The table includes the annual payment per MW, the annual payment for the system, and the cumulative payment over the 20 years.

If you need further details or modifications, please let me know!

at what $/mW rate can you realize the 2% escalator over 20 years in fixed payments

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-07-30 12:15:54*

To determine the fixed payment per MW that would result in the same total payout over 20 years with a 2% annual increase, we need to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the series of escalating payments and then solve for the equivalent fixed annual payment.

The formula for the future value of an annuity with annual escalation is:

\[ FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \times (1 + r) \]

where:
- \( P \) is the initial payment per MW ($40,000)
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (2% or 0.02)
- \( n \) is the number of years (20)

Let's calculate the fixed annual payment that results in the same NPV as the series of escalating payments.

I'll compute this now.

**Assistant:**

To realize the equivalent of a 2% escalator over 20 years in fixed annual payments, you would need a fixed payment rate of approximately $59,437.90 per MW per year.
