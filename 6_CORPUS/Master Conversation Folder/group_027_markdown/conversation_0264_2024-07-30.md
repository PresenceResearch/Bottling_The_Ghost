The white dots on your plant look like they could be signs of a pest infestation, such as mealybugs or scale insects, or possibly a fungal infection. Here are some steps you can take to address this:

1. **Inspect the Plant Thoroughly**: Check both the upper and lower sides of the leaves, as well as the stems, to identify any visible pests.
   
2. **Clean the Leaves**: Wipe down the leaves with a damp cloth to remove the white spots. If the spots come off easily, they are likely mealybugs or a similar pest.

3. **Use Insecticidal Soap**: If the problem is pests, treat the plant with insecticidal soap or a neem oil solution. Follow the instructions on the product label for the best results.

4. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that your plant is in a well-ventilated area to prevent fungal infections from spreading.

5. **Quarantine the Plant**: Isolate the affected plant from other plants to prevent the spread of pests or disease.

6. **Monitor the Plant**: Keep an eye on the plant for the next few weeks to ensure the issue does not return.

If the white spots persist or worsen, you might want to consult with a local nursery or gardening expert for a more specific diagnosis and treatment plan.

1. **Use Clean, Sharp Scissors or Pruners**: Make sure your cutting tool is clean to prevent any potential spread of disease.

2. **Cut at the Base**: Remove the brown leaves by cutting them as close to the base of the plant as possible without damaging the healthy parts.

3. **Dispose of the Leaves Properly**: Discard the removed leaves away from your other plants to prevent any potential pests or diseases from spreading.

To clean the leaves of your plant, you can use the following methods:

1. **Water and Soft Cloth**: Dampen a soft cloth or sponge with lukewarm water and gently wipe the leaves. This is effective for removing dust and small pests like spider mites or aphids.

2. **Mild Soapy Water**: Mix a few drops of mild liquid dish soap in a spray bottle filled with water. Spray the solution on the leaves and gently wipe them with a soft cloth. Rinse the leaves with clean water afterward to remove any soap residue. This is particularly effective for dealing with pests like mealybugs.

3. **Neem Oil Solution**: Neem oil is a natural pesticide and can help deal with pests while cleaning the leaves. Mix neem oil with water according to the instructions on the product label, spray the solution on the leaves, and wipe gently. Neem oil also helps in preventing future infestations.

4. **Insecticidal Soap**: This is specifically designed to be safe for plants while killing pests. Follow the instructions on the product label for application.

5. **Diluted Vinegar Solution**: Mix a tablespoon of vinegar with a quart of water. This solution can help clean the leaves and deter some pests. Wipe the leaves with the solution and then rinse with clean water.

Always test a small area of the plant first to ensure that the cleaning solution does not damage the leaves. Clean the leaves gently to avoid causing any physical damage to the plant.
