Yes, you can take practice exams for the CCBC English assessment for ESOL. The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) offers a comprehensive ESOL program that includes placement testing to determine the appropriate course level for new students. These placement tests assess your English skills in areas such as speaking, listening, reading, writing, grammar, and vocabulary.

To prepare for the ESOL placement tests, CCBC provides resources and support through their Academic ESOL program. You can find practice materials and sample tests through CCBC's resources. It's recommended to contact the ESOL office or visit the [CCBC ESOL webpage](https://www.ccbcmd.edu/Programs-and-Courses/Schools-and-Academic-Departments/School-of-Writing-Literacy-and-Languages/English-for-Speakers-of-Other-Languages-ESOL.aspx) for more specific information and to schedule your placement test.

Additionally, new students are required to attend a Walk-in ESOL Placement and Registration session, where they will take the placement test and receive guidance on enrolling in the appropriate ESOL courses. These sessions ensure that you start at the right level to help you succeed in your academic and professional goals.
