If you're looking for an app that tracks various credit card rewards, including the Apple Card, you might consider using **MaxRewards**. MaxRewards can track your credit card rewards, cash back, and offer alerts for different card benefits, including those from the Apple Card.\n\nAlternatively, **CardPointers** is another app that helps you manage credit card rewards, including the Apple Card. It can automatically track offers and ensure you're maximizing your rewards across all your cards.\n\nBoth apps are designed to help you make the most of your credit cards, similar to how AwardWallet helps with travel rewards."
