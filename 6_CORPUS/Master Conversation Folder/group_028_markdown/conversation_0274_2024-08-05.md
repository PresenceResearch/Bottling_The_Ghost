As of July 1, 2024, the adjusted value for Maryland Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) reflects significant legislative changes. Systems installed after this date will generate what are termed "Certified SRECs," which can satisfy 150% of a utility's compliance requirement. This implies a premium value compared to legacy SRECs.

### Key Details:
1. **Maryland Certified SREC Market Launch**: Systems installed after July 1, 2024, will begin producing Certified SRECs starting January 1, 2025. These SRECs will initially be priced at approximately 1.5 times the legacy SREC value【9†source】【10†source】.
   
2. **SREC Prices and Premiums**: 
   - For 2025, Certified SRECs are expected to have an implied SACP (Solar Alternative Compliance Payment) of $82.50, with an estimated premium of $27.50 above the regular SACP of $55【11†source】【9†source】.
   - This premium reflects the increased value utilities derive from using Certified SRECs to meet a larger portion of their compliance obligations.

3. **Regulatory Changes**: 
   - The Maryland Solar Bill (HB1435/SB0737) introduced these changes to boost solar adoption by providing more incentives through higher SREC values and extended SREC lifespan from three to five years【8†source】【9†source】.
   - New installations on rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites are particularly incentivized【10†source】.

For more detailed information, you can review the sources from Sol Systems and Flett Exchange, which provide insights into these legislative updates and their implications for SREC markets【8†source】【10†source】.
