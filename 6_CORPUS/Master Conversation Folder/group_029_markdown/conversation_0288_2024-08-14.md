For reliable weather information in Japan, the **"Yahoo Weather"** app is highly recommended. It's one of the most popular weather apps in Japan, offering detailed forecasts, real-time alerts, and radar maps. The app also provides information on seasonal events, such as typhoons and cherry blossom forecasts, which can be particularly useful if you're traveling.

Another great option is **"Tenki.jp"** by the Japan Weather Association. This app provides accurate weather forecasts with detailed hourly updates, rain cloud radar, and emergency alerts for various regions in Japan.

Both apps are available in English and can be easily downloaded from the App Store or Google Play.

Yes, **Tenki.jp** does have an English version available. While the main website and app are primarily in Japanese, there is an English option for the website, and the app has been designed to be user-friendly even if you don’t read Japanese.

If you prefer to use the app in English, you might need to navigate through the settings to switch the language to English. However, if you encounter difficulties with the app’s language settings, you can also use the English version of their website by visiting [Tenki.jp](https://www.tenki.jp/) and selecting the English option. 

For more comprehensive English language support, the **Yahoo Weather** app might be more straightforward to use as it offers robust English support out of the box.

If you're looking for an app that provides weather information based on Japanese data and offers full English support, the **Japan Weather Radar (by WeatherNews)** app is a solid choice. It’s available in English and uses data from Japan Meteorological Agency, which ensures accurate and localized weather information. This app provides detailed forecasts, real-time rain radar, typhoon tracking, and earthquake alerts, all in English.

Another option is the **NHK World Weather** app, which provides weather forecasts across Japan. Although it doesn't offer the same level of detail as some of the Japanese apps, it does provide reliable weather updates in English and is user-friendly for non-Japanese speakers.

Both of these apps should meet your needs for localized, accurate weather information in English.
