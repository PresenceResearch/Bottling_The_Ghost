Typhoons and hurricanes are essentially the same meteorological phenomenon—a type of tropical cyclone—but they are named differently depending on where they occur. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Location**: 
   - **Hurricanes** occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific Ocean.
   - **Typhoons** occur in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the region of Asia.

2. **Naming Convention**: 
   - The term "hurricane" is used in the Americas, including the United States and Caribbean nations.
   - The term "typhoon" is used primarily in Southeast Asia, Japan, and China.

3. **Intensity and Structure**: 
   - Both hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones with similar structure, featuring a central eye, eye wall, and spiraling rainbands.
   - The intensity of these storms is measured using similar scales, like the Saffir-Simpson scale for hurricanes and the JMA scale for typhoons, though the names and categories may differ slightly.

4. **Seasonality**: 
   - Hurricane season in the Atlantic typically runs from June to November.
   - Typhoon season in the northwest Pacific can be more variable, though it often peaks from May to October.

In summary, the primary difference between a typhoon and a hurricane is their geographic location. Both terms refer to powerful tropical cyclones but are used in different parts of the world.
