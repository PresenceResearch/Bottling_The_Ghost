In Japan, it's customary to bring a thoughtful gift, known as an *omiyage*, when staying at someone's home. A few options that would be well-received include:

1. **High-quality sweets**: Consider bringing *wagashi* (traditional Japanese sweets), or even something unique from your home country, such as artisanal chocolates or cookies.

2. **Local specialties**: If you’re from a different region, bringing something representative of that area, like a regional delicacy, would be appreciated.

3. **Nice tea or sake**: A high-quality tea, such as *sencha* or *gyokuro*, or a bottle of sake could be a lovely gesture.

4. **Small household items**: Beautifully packaged hand towels (*tenugui*) or an elegant small dish or tray can be a nice touch.

Make sure to present the gift nicely and express your gratitude verbally when giving it.
