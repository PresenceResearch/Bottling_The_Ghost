The object in the photos appears to be a Japanese military item, possibly a shell casing or a commemorative piece, given its shape and the Japanese characters inscribed on it. The inscriptions are in Japanese Kanji, and they include a date, possibly a name, and other significant terms related to the military.

Here’s a rough translation of the inscription:

- 昭和: "Shōwa," which is the era name corresponding to the reign of Emperor Hirohito (1926-1989).
- 戌之冬: "Year of the Dog, Winter" (This is part of the sexagenary cycle in the traditional Chinese calendar, which is also used in Japan. It indicates a specific year in the Shōwa era, though more context is needed for exact dating).
- 陸軍大臣: "Rikugun Daijin," meaning "Minister of the Army."
- 白川義則: "Shirakawa Yoshinori," likely referring to General Yoshinori Shirakawa, a high-ranking officer in the Imperial Japanese Army.

The item might be a commemorative piece or a shell casing from a ceremonial event, especially given the mention of General Shirakawa. The Shōwa era reference and the mention of a specific year or time period suggest it dates back to a time during Emperor Hirohito's reign, potentially around the 1930s or 1940s. 

If you need a more precise translation or historical context, I recommend consulting with a specialist in Japanese military history or an expert in Japanese language translation.

The inscription in the image reads as follows:

- 天壌無窮 (Tenjō Mukyū): This phrase can be translated as "endless as heaven and earth" or "eternally unchanging." It conveys a sense of everlasting endurance and is often used in a patriotic or imperial context, expressing the eternal nature of a nation's or an emperor's reign.

This is likely a commemorative phrase, possibly related to the Emperor or the Japanese military, emphasizing the enduring spirit of Japan or the Imperial Army. Given the context, it could be part of a ceremonial or commemorative object, perhaps honoring a particular event, leader, or period in Japanese history.

What was happening in the Japanese military in the winter of 1928

In the winter of 1928, significant events were occurring within the Japanese military and in Japan's broader political and military strategy.

### Key Events and Context:

1. **Manchurian Ambitions**: During the late 1920s, Japan was increasingly focused on its interests in Manchuria, a region in northeastern China. Japanese military factions were pushing for more aggressive policies to expand Japan's influence and control in the region. This period set the stage for the eventual invasion of Manchuria in 1931.

2. **Assassination of Zhang Zuolin**: In June 1928, earlier in the year, Japanese military officers orchestrated the assassination of Zhang Zuolin, a powerful Chinese warlord and ruler of Manchuria. This event was significant because it illustrated the growing power and influence of the Kwantung Army, a Japanese military faction stationed in Manchuria, and their willingness to act independently of the Japanese government.

3. **Political Tensions**: The late 1920s were a period of political instability in Japan. There was a growing divide between the civilian government and the military, with the latter increasingly advocating for a more assertive foreign policy, particularly in China. This tension contributed to the rise of militarism in Japan during the 1930s.

4. **Military Reforms**: The Japanese military was undergoing significant reforms during this period, including modernization efforts and strategic planning for potential conflicts in Asia. The focus was on strengthening Japan's military capabilities and preparing for future territorial expansion.

5. **Taishō Democracy to Shōwa Militarism**: The winter of 1928 falls within a transitional period between the Taishō era (1912-1926) and the early years of the Shōwa era (1926-1989). While the Taishō period was characterized by a brief experiment with democracy, the Shōwa era saw the rise of militarism and imperial expansion, leading eventually to Japan's involvement in World War II.

### Specific Military Events in Winter 1928:

- **Continued Consolidation of Power by the Kwantung Army**: The Kwantung Army continued to consolidate its power in Manchuria, laying the groundwork for future expansion. This winter would have seen the Japanese military continuing to strategize and plan their moves in East Asia, particularly in relation to China.

- **Strategic Planning**: The winter of 1928 likely involved strategic military planning sessions as Japan prepared for more assertive actions in the region. This included potential future conflicts and the militarization of Japanese society.

In summary, the winter of 1928 was a period of increasing military ambition and preparation for future expansion in East Asia. The Japanese military was becoming more assertive, particularly in relation to China, setting the stage for the aggressive actions that would follow in the early 1930s.

General Shirakawa Yoshinori (白川 義則) was a prominent Japanese military leader during the early 20th century. Born on January 24, 1869, in Kagoshima, Japan, Shirakawa had a distinguished military career, rising to the rank of General in the Imperial Japanese Army. Here are some key points about his life and career:

### Early Career and Background
- **Education and Early Military Service**: Shirakawa graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and later attended the Army War College, where he received advanced military training. He was part of the generation of officers who played significant roles in Japan's military campaigns during the late Meiji and Taishō periods.

### Military Career
- **Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)**: Shirakawa served in the Russo-Japanese War, where Japan emerged victorious against the Russian Empire. His performance during the war helped him advance through the ranks of the Japanese military.

- **Command Positions**: Over the years, Shirakawa held various command positions, including leadership roles in different army divisions. His expertise in military strategy and leadership was recognized within the military hierarchy.

### Role in China
- **Service in China**: General Shirakawa is perhaps most noted for his role in China during the turbulent years leading up to and following the Mukden Incident of 1931, which led to Japan's invasion of Manchuria. Although he was not directly involved in the Mukden Incident, his presence in China during the late 1920s and early 1930s coincided with significant Japanese military activities in the region.

### Assassination
- **Assassination in Shanghai**: General Shirakawa met a tragic end on May 26, 1932, when he was assassinated in Shanghai by Korean nationalist Yun Bong-gil. During a public ceremony in Hongkou Park (now Lu Xun Park), Yun threw a bomb at a platform where Japanese officials, including Shirakawa, were seated. Shirakawa was severely injured in the attack and succumbed to his injuries several days later.

### Legacy
- **Impact and Legacy**: General Shirakawa's assassination had significant repercussions, further straining relations between Japan and China and contributing to the growing tensions in East Asia that would eventually lead to full-scale conflict in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). His death also highlighted the rising anti-Japanese sentiment in the region, particularly among Koreans and Chinese opposed to Japanese imperialism.

General Shirakawa Yoshinori is remembered as a key military figure in Japan's early 20th-century history, particularly for his involvement in Japan's military endeavors in China and the tragic circumstances of his death.
