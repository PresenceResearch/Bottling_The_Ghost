"Chitarra con ayu e rucola" refers to a pasta dish where "chitarra" is a type of pasta, "ayu" likely refers to sweetfish (a type of fish found in Japan), and "rucola" is arugula, a peppery green often used in salads.

In this dish, the chitarra pasta, which is a square-shaped spaghetti made using a traditional tool called a "chitarra" (meaning "guitar" in Italian), would be paired with the delicate flavor of sweetfish and the sharpness of arugula. It's a fusion dish combining Italian pasta with Japanese ingredients, creating a unique flavor profile.
