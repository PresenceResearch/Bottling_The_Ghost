The original Cartier box can add significant value to a watch, particularly if it is in good condition and accompanied by other original accessories such as papers, manuals, or certificates. For collectible watches, like those from Cartier, having the original box can increase the watch's resale value by anywhere from 10% to 20%, depending on the watch's overall rarity and desirability.

Buyers often view the original packaging as a sign that the watch has been well cared for and maintained, which can make the item more appealing and valuable in the eyes of collectors and enthusiasts. For instance, a Cartier Must de Cartier 21 with the original box and papers might sell for a few hundred dollars more compared to a similar model without these extras.

If you are considering selling or valuing this watch, including the box in your listing could help attract more potential buyers and justify a higher asking price.
