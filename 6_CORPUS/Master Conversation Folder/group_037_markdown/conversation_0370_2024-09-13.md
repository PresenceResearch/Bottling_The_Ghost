In Maryland, there are several incentives for installing a parking canopy solar array that can help reduce the upfront costs and improve the financial returns on such projects. Here are the main incentives currently available:

### 1. **Maryland Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)**
- **SRECs:** For every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity your solar system produces, you earn an SREC that can be sold or traded on the open market to utilities required to meet Maryland's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The value of SRECs fluctuates based on supply and demand but remains a significant financial incentive.

### 2. **Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**
- **ITC:** While not Maryland-specific, the federal ITC allows you to deduct 30% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from your federal taxes. This incentive is available through 2032 and applies to all types of solar installations, including parking canopies.

### 3. **Property Tax Exemption**
- **Property Tax Exemption for Solar Systems:** In Maryland, solar energy systems are exempt from state property taxes. This means the value added to a property by installing a solar canopy will not increase the property tax assessed.

### 4. **Sales and Use Tax Exemption**
- **Sales Tax Exemption:** Maryland exempts solar energy equipment from state sales tax. This exemption reduces the upfront cost by 6% for purchasing solar panels, inverters, and other associated equipment.

### 5. **Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) Incentives**
- **MEA Grant Programs:** The Maryland Energy Administration periodically offers grant programs for commercial-scale renewable energy projects, including solar parking canopies. The availability and size of these grants can vary, so it's essential to check the MEA website for current offerings.

### 6. **Local Incentives**
- **County or Municipal Incentives:** Some local governments in Maryland may offer additional incentives, rebates, or tax credits for solar installations, including parking canopies. For example, Montgomery County has a Green Bank that offers financing options for commercial solar projects.

### 7. **Depreciation Benefits**
- **Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS):** Businesses can also take advantage of the MACRS depreciation method for solar assets, allowing them to recover the cost of solar property through tax deductions over five years. The ITC also qualifies for "bonus depreciation," which allows for accelerated depreciation in the first year.

### 8. **PACE Financing (Property Assessed Clean Energy)**
- **PACE Financing:** Maryland offers commercial PACE programs that provide long-term financing for solar and other energy efficiency projects. This financing is repaid through a property tax assessment, potentially offering lower interest rates and more extended repayment periods.
