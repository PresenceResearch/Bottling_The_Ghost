            "**A Ballad of Shelagh and Mark**\n\n*Verse 1*  \nShelagh and Mark, in college days,  \nTwo souls entwined in bright sun rays,  \nThey laughed and learned through fleeting years,  \nShared secrets, dreams, and conquered fears.  \nBut time, it moves with endless might,  \nAnd life took flight like birds in flight,  \nShe left with music in her veins,  \nHe stayed with numbers, deals, and gains.  \n\n*Chorus*  \nOh, thirty years, how swift they passed,  \nTwo hearts apart, but love could last,  \nShelagh and Mark, they found their way,  \nTo meet once more and love today.  \n\n*Verse 2*  \nShelagh played on Broadway's stage,  \nHer horn, it sang through every age,  \nShe charmed the crowd with every note,  \nAs melodies from deep she wrote.  \nMark built his world with sun and light,  \nIn business deals from day to night,  \nHe chased his dreams through skies so wide,  \nBut always felt a space inside.  \n\n*Chorus*  \nOh, thirty years, how swift they passed,  \nTwo hearts apart, but love could last,  \nShelagh and Mark, they found their way,  \nTo meet once more and love today.  \n\n*Verse 3*  \nBy chance, they met on city streets,  \nTwo pairs of eyes, two hearts, one beat,  \nA smile, a laugh, a spark anew,  \nThe years had passed, but love still grew.  \nNo longer bound by distant dreams,  \nThey seized the day like rushing streams,  \nFor all the time they'd been apart,  \nHad never stilled their faithful hearts.  \n\n*Chorus*  \nOh, thirty years, how swift they passed,  \nTwo hearts apart, but love could last,  \nShelagh and Mark, they found their way,  \nTo meet once more and love today.  \n\n*Bridge*  \nNow hand in hand, they walk this land,  \nNo time to waste, no hour unplanned,  \nFor love that's true, it knows no age,  \nA story penned on life's grand stage.  \n\n*Outro*  \nShelagh's horn still softly plays,  \nWhile Mark stands near in golden rays,  \nTwo souls, one path, no more apart,  \nTogether now, with one shared heart.  \n\n*Final Chorus*  \nOh, thirty years, no more they passed,  \nTwo hearts as one, in love at last,  \nShelagh and Mark, forever they,  \nHave found their love, and come what may.
