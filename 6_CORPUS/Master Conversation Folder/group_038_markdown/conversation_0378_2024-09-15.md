Yes, you can plant an outside daisy (typically a hardy perennial daisy variety) indoors, but there are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Light**: Daisies need plenty of sunlight, so make sure to place them near a bright window where they can get at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. If natural light is insufficient, consider using a grow light.

2. **Soil**: Use a well-draining potting mix, ideally one formulated for flowers or houseplants. Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating and causing root rot.

3. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry. Be careful not to overwater, as daisies do not like soggy conditions.

4. **Temperature and Humidity**: Daisies generally prefer cooler temperatures (60-70°F or 15-21°C). Indoor humidity is usually sufficient, but avoid placing them near heating vents or air conditioners, which can dry out the air.

5. **Fertilizing**: During the growing season (spring and summer), feed your indoor daisy with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 2-4 weeks.

By providing the right conditions, you can successfully grow daisies indoors and enjoy their blooms year-round.
