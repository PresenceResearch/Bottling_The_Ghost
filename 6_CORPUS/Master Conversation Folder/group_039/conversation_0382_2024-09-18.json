            "**Opening Statement:**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, Your Honor, distinguished guests,\n\nI stand before you today in strong favor of transitioning into a pay-to-play LNTP (Limited Notice to Proceed) model. In the realm of cash and developer deals, this model offers a strategic, organized approach to financing and execution. The prosecution proposes the development of a price list tiered based on size and complexity, which I will elaborate upon shortly.\n\n**Exhibit #1:** Presented before you is a scope of work from my colleague, Brian Levy (Case No. 2024-CV-00251). Brian has built a business specializing in Low-to-Moderate Income (LMI) solar projects, particularly within our geographical footprint. His model acts as a comprehensive service for Low-Income Housing owners, handling every step of the project lifecycle, including securing funding.\n\nI direct your attention to the exhibit, which outlines the responsibilities of the EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction). Under the LNTP model, the deliverables outlined below represent a structured approach, leading to a near-guaranteed project viability until the Notice to Proceed (NTP).\n\nThe NTP, in this instance, functions similarly to the EPCA (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement). By this stage, enough groundwork has been laid for NTP to seamlessly transition into procurement, thus accelerating the overall timeline.\n\n**Witness #1 \u2013 Eric Corsi (Case No. 2024-W-00714)**  \nMr. Corsi, as a respected industry expert, I ask you the following:\n- Do you believe this scope is adequate or excessive for the project at hand?\n- Based on your professional experience, how long, on average, would it take to complete this process?\n- From a pricing standpoint, how much of these costs would be considered passthrough expenses (e.g., structural designs, permit-ready packages, electrical/IX delivery packages)?\n- Excluding the structural review, is there an opportunity to reduce costs by outsourcing any portion of this work? Could cheaper alternatives be found for such tasks?\n\n**Witness #2 \u2013 Noah Jacobs (Case No. 2024-W-00865)**  \nMr. Jacobs, I call upon you to testify regarding internal resources and time allocation. Specifically:\n- What would be the draw on internal resources for a project of this scale?\n- How many onsite visits would be required, and how much of Don's time would be allocated to permits?\n- How much time would MK need to contribute, and how much involvement would Joe Merritt have post-survey?\n- Could we potentially use the Energy Services price list to streamline the process? Furthermore, can we estimate this work as T&M (Time & Materials) to ensure cost-efficiency?\n- What metrics should guide our pricing? Should we evaluate by $/Watt, tiered by size, or implement a punchlist system akin to DealHub?\n\n**Closing Statement:**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution has presented a strong, fact-based argument in favor of adopting a pay-to-play LNTP model for cash and developer-funded projects.\n\nThe defense may argue that cash and developer deals are not a priority at this time, and that Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) deals do not provide predevelopment capital, thus shifting financial responsibility to the company and increasing exposure to risk. However, we have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.\n\nIn *Lumina Solar, LLC v. Amidus, LLC (Case No. 2024-CV-00398)*, we have seen that the financial consequences of absorbing predevelopment costs without an LNTP model lead to exponential risk. Furthermore, the defense's arguments were effectively dismantled by the precedent set in *Lumina Solar, LLC v. Cordish Companies, LLC (DBA Joppatowne Marketplace) (Case No. 2023-CV-00412)*, which establishes that claims of financial incapacity to fund predevelopment activities are baseless.\n\nThe prosecution therefore proposes setting aside a reasonable monthly budget for predevelopment activities, as guided by *Lumina v. Cordish Companies*. These funds will be deployed judiciously, with oversight by a court-appointed intermediary, and reviewed by both parties to ensure fairness and transparency.\n\nThe time has come to embrace a structured, sustainable model that protects the interests of all parties and ensures efficient project execution. The prosecution rests."

            "**Opening Statement:**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, Your Honor, distinguished guests,\n\nI am here today to present a clear and compelling case in favor of transitioning into a pay-to-play LNTP (Limited Notice to Proceed) model. This model, particularly for cash and developer deals, is not only efficient but necessary for ensuring project viability. We have developed a tiered pricing structure based on project size and complexity, which I will explain in greater detail momentarily.\n\n**Exhibit #1:** Let me introduce the scope of work provided by my esteemed colleague, Brian Levy (Case No. 2024-CV-00251). Brian is a respected leader in the LMI (Low-to-Moderate Income) solar space, with a focus on comprehensive project management. His model serves as a one-stop solution for Low-Income Housing owners, overseeing every phase of the project, including securing essential funding.\n\nI ask you to focus on the assigned responsibilities of the EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) in the exhibit provided. Under the LNTP model, the deliverables set forth here practically guarantee the viability of the project until the Notice to Proceed (NTP), which effectively mirrors an EPCA (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement). By this stage, sufficient groundwork has been completed to allow the project to immediately transition into the procurement phase, further expediting the overall process.\n\n**Witness #1 \u2013 Eric Corsi (Case No. 2024-W-00714)**  \nMr. Corsi, as an expert in this field, I have the following questions:\n- Is this scope of work adequate, or does it represent an overcommitment of resources?\n- Based on your experience, how long, on average, would it take to complete this process?\n- For pricing, how much of the cost would be considered passthrough expenses, such as structural designs, permit-ready packages, and electrical delivery packages?\n- Would there be opportunities to reduce costs by outsourcing? Could we find more affordable options for tasks like structural review?\n\n**Witness #2 \u2013 Noah Jacobs (Case No. 2024-W-00865)**  \nMr. Jacobs, with regard to internal resources, I have the following inquiries:\n- What would be the impact on internal resources, such as onsite visits and time spent on permits?\n- How much time would Don, MK, and Joe Merritt need to commit to this project after the survey phase?\n- Is it feasible to use the Energy Services price list, and could we apply Time & Materials (T&M) billing to control costs?\n- What metrics should be used to price this work? Should we consider $/Watt, a tiered approach by project size, or a punchlist model similar to DealHub?\n\n**Closing Statement:**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution has laid out an undeniable case for adopting a pay-to-play LNTP model for cash and developer-funded projects. Now, let me turn to the defense\u2019s position, which is not only weak but entirely baseless.\n\nThe defense has suggested that cash and developer deals are not the company\u2019s current priority, and they claim that Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) deals do not provide predevelopment capital, thereby shifting financial responsibility and exposing the company to undue risk. However, these arguments fall apart under scrutiny.\n\nIn *Lumina Solar, LLC v. Amidus, LLC (Case No. 2024-CV-00398)*, the courts clearly demonstrated that the financial risks associated with predevelopment costs can be mitigated through a structured LNTP model. The defense's case rests on the false premise that adopting such a model would increase risk\u2014when, in fact, the opposite is true. Without an LNTP framework, the company absorbs exponential risk, as highlighted in this case.\n\nAdditionally, in *Lumina Solar, LLC v. Cordish Companies, LLC (DBA Joppatowne Marketplace) (Case No. 2023-CV-00412)*, the precedent decisively confirms that the defense's claims of financial incapacity to fund predevelopment activities are entirely unfounded. The court in that case rendered the defense\u2019s arguments void, stating that the company\u2019s actions\u2014failing to implement safeguards like an LNTP model\u2014created more financial exposure, not less.\n\nThe defense\u2019s inability to provide any evidence to support their claim of financial incapacity further weakens their argument. Not only have they failed to present a viable alternative, but their position directly contradicts established legal precedents. Their case, simply put, is unsupported by facts or logic. The notion that PPA deals and developer deals cannot be managed under an LNTP model has been thoroughly discredited.\n\nIn contrast, the prosecution has shown, with evidence and through the precedent set in *Lumina v. Cordish Companies*, that a pay-to-play LNTP model significantly reduces risk and ensures fiscal responsibility. We therefore propose the establishment of a monthly budget for acceptable predevelopment activities, overseen by a court-appointed intermediary and reviewed by both parties.\n\nThe defense has failed to meet the burden of proof necessary to challenge the merits of this model. Their case is built on conjecture and unsupported claims, while the prosecution has provided a clear, structured path forward based on established legal precedent. The choice is clear: adopting the pay-to-play LNTP model is the only viable option for ensuring financial and operational security.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution rests."

            "The *Cordish Companies* case (Lumina Solar, LLC v. Cordish Companies, LLC, DBA Joppatowne Marketplace, Case No. 2023-CV-00412) reveals a clear hypocrisy in the defense's argument. In that case, Cordish asserted that predevelopment costs were too financially burdensome to justify an LNTP model. However, as the court's decision exposed, Cordish had, in fact, been able to sustain and manage similar financial commitments in other projects without issue. The defense's claim that predevelopment costs were untenable was not only unfounded but contradicted their own prior business practices.\n\nThe hypocrisy is evident: while the defense portrays the LNTP model as an unreasonable financial burden, their own history of managing projects under similar circumstances tells a different story. They argue that LNTP would introduce undue risk, but their actions in the *Cordish* case demonstrated that the failure to implement such a model results in even greater exposure to financial and operational risk. By refusing to adopt the LNTP structure, they intentionally shifted risk onto parties with less control, while benefiting from the flexibility and financial advantages of their predevelopment activities.\n\nThis contradiction lays bare the defense's opportunism in cherry-picking arguments based on convenience rather than consistent business principles. It further undermines the credibility of their position, exposing their unwillingness to acknowledge the established benefits of the LNTP model\u2014benefits they have previously enjoyed but now seek to deny in the interest of short-term financial gain."
