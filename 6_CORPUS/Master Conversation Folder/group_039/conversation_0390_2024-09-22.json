Still, these are just some of the 200+ professional performers you'll pleasantly encounter at the \u3010158\u2020Renaissance Festival\u3011. With the Royal Court, ten performance stages, and spontaneous street acts, you may also find yourself in the presence of royalty, valiant knights, magicians, minstrels, and jesters. If you, too, want to join in the fun, dress in costume for an instant way to get in the spirit of frivolity!\n\n[Image 4: Wreath sellers at the Maryland Renaissance Festival] Get into the festive spirit by purchasing a wreath from one of the local peddlers.\u00a0 Image courtesy of \u3010157\u2020Susan Carvin\u2020rennfest.com\u3011 from the Maryland Renaissance Festival.\n\nYou can add handcrafted details to your ensemble, like a flower crown or leather pouch, when you peruse the shops of over 140 artisans populating the grounds. If you love the thrill of action and adventure, step into the 3,000-seat arena of the King's Court for live jousting while you cheer on the Knight of your kingdom. There is sportsmanship aplenty at the festival, with demonstrations by archers, aerialists, weapons masters, and more. With plenty of opportunities to test your medieval strength.\n\n[Image 5: A Knight on horse back at the Renaissance Festival] Be sure to step into the 3,000-seat arena of the King's Court for live jousting while you cheer on the Knight of your own kingdom. \u00a0Image courtesy of \u3010157\u2020Paha Chowdhury\u2020rennfest.com\u3011 from the Maryland Renaissance Festival.\n\n## Plan Your Trip\n\n\u301079\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#### \u301079\u2020Hotels\u3011\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#### \u301038\u2020Concerts & Live Music\u3011\n\n\u3010106\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#### \u3010106\u2020On The Water\u3011\n\n### Family-Fun Entertainment for All Ages\n\nIf you find yourself ravenous or parched after all the competition, fear not\u2013\u00a0everyone \u301089\u2020eats and drinks\u3011 like kings in Revel Grove. Bite into a smoked turkey leg, fresh crepe, or an apple pastry from Maryland\u2019s fall bounty. Enjoy the portable decadence of mac & cheese on a stick or a scotch egg. Wash it all down with a toast of mead or honey wine, the perfect refresher as Maryland weekends transition from warm summer into crisp fall.\n\nWith so much to see and such little time, why not make your trip to the Maryland Renaissance Festival a \u301037\u2020weekend-long adventure\u3011?

Still, these are just some of the 200+ professional performers you'll pleasantly encounter at the \u3010158\u2020Renaissance Festival\u3011. With the Royal Court, ten performance stages, and spontaneous street acts, you may also find yourself in the presence of royalty, valiant knights, magicians, minstrels, and jesters. If you, too, want to join in the fun, dress in costume for an instant way to get in the spirit of frivolity!\n\n[Image 4: Wreath sellers at the Maryland Renaissance Festival] Get into the festive spirit by purchasing a wreath from one of the local peddlers.\u00a0 Image courtesy of \u3010157\u2020Susan Carvin\u2020rennfest.com\u3011 from the Maryland Renaissance Festival.\n\nYou can add handcrafted details to your ensemble, like a flower crown or leather pouch, when you peruse the shops of over 140 artisans populating the grounds. If you love the thrill of action and adventure, step into the 3,000-seat arena of the King's Court for live jousting while you cheer on the Knight of your kingdom. There is sportsmanship aplenty at the festival, with demonstrations by archers, aerialists, weapons masters, and more. With plenty of opportunities to test your medieval strength.\n\n[Image 5: A Knight on horse back at the Renaissance Festival] Be sure to step into the 3,000-seat arena of the King's Court for live jousting while you cheer on the Knight of your own kingdom. \u00a0Image courtesy of \u3010157\u2020Paha Chowdhury\u2020rennfest.com\u3011 from the Maryland Renaissance Festival.\n\n## Plan Your Trip\n\n\u301079\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#### \u301079\u2020Hotels\u3011\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#### \u301038\u2020Concerts & Live Music\u3011\n\n\u3010106\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#### \u3010106\u2020On The Water\u3011\n\n### Family-Fun Entertainment for All Ages\n\nIf you find yourself ravenous or parched after all the competition, fear not\u2013\u00a0everyone \u301089\u2020eats and drinks\u3011 like kings in Revel Grove. Bite into a smoked turkey leg, fresh crepe, or an apple pastry from Maryland\u2019s fall bounty. Enjoy the portable decadence of mac & cheese on a stick or a scotch egg.
