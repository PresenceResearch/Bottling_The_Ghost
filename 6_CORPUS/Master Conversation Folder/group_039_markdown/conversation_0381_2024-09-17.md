The structure in the image appears to be an elevated walkway or conveyor system, possibly part of an industrial facility or factory. Such structures were often used in industrial settings to transport goods or materials between buildings or sections of a factory. The design, including the windows and metal support beams, suggests it could have been used for moving materials like coal, grain, or manufactured goods. The surrounding area, which includes industrial-style buildings, further indicates this might have been part of a larger factory or production plant. 

If this is located near a historical factory or mill, it could have been specifically used for moving raw materials or products across different parts of the facility.
