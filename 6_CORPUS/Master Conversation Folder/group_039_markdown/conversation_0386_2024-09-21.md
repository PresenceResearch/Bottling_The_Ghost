please rewrite this in the form of an Amazon Memo. How We Got HereCommitted to building processes to support campaign before execution.  Blasting things out with no real way of tracking would be impossible to track.  This included salesforce, calendly, potentially hubspot if we did an email campaign.

**To:** [Team or Relevant Parties]  
**From:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Process Development for Campaign Execution

---

### **Overview**
We have taken a dedicated approach to building processes that will effectively support our campaign execution efforts. The absence of structured tracking mechanisms would make it difficult, if not impossible, to measure the success or impact of our initiatives.

---

### **Current Status**
To address this challenge, we have focused on implementing several key tools and platforms, including Salesforce, Calendly, and potentially HubSpot for any email campaigns. These systems will enable us to track outreach efforts, manage leads, and ensure follow-ups are executed in a timely and efficient manner.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Salesforce Integration:** Continue utilizing Salesforce as our primary CRM tool for tracking interactions, follow-ups, and campaign performance metrics.
2. **Calendly:** Leverage Calendly for seamless scheduling and managing client interactions during the campaign.
3. **Email Campaigns:** If we choose to run an email campaign, HubSpot will be explored for its robust tracking and analytics capabilities.

These steps are essential for ensuring a coordinated and measurable campaign moving forward.

this one please Thanks for bringing this to the forefront again, I think this is a good time to push this along.
Long story short this is where we are, how we got here, and my suggestions for a path forward:
Where We AreStalled about 30% into the process.  Lots of ideas, some foundational work, no momentum now.
How We Got HereCommitted to building processes to support campaign before execution.  Blasting things out with no real way of tracking would be impossible to track.  This included salesforce, calendly, potentially hubspot if we did an email campaign.Riley concentrated on building materials.  Focus was placed on collateral and website material.  I was the bottleneck a bit on this but he would email or slack me once and ask me for 10 things and then I would never hear from him again.In a mid- August EOS meeting you had said that this effort needs to be halted until we have a discovery call template solidified and this needs to be my primary focus before we spend any money on marketing.Overall I've been very cautious when it comes to asking for resources given the performance of my division.  Given impending events I will be in a better place to start requesting resources.  NOTE - I was running a large portion of this project with Riley as my marketing liaison.  When my focus shifted to other more immediate things this died on the vine.  I'll own at least half of this.
Path ForwardI will prepare a summary of the work that has been done thus far.  I will include my updated strategies based on the last three months' experiencesThis will be used as a base from which we can restart the process.  You'll have it by Monday.Next StepsI propose scheduling a "Soft Reset" meeting when we can.  Potentially Face to Face in the office Tuesday?I'll be prepared with material and strategies.  LAST THING - Colin it might be a good idea for us to have this meeting without you and then schedule something with you when we have collated everything and have an accurate, actionable plan.

**To:** [Team or Relevant Parties]  
**From:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Campaign Process: Current Status and Path Forward

---

### **Overview**
Thank you for highlighting this issue again. Now is an appropriate time to move this initiative forward. Below is a summary of where we currently stand, how we arrived here, and my recommendations for the next steps.

---

### **Where We Are**
We are stalled about 30% into the process. While we have generated numerous ideas and completed some foundational work, we have lost momentum at this stage.

---

### **How We Got Here**
Our initial efforts were focused on building the necessary processes to support the campaign before execution. It was clear that launching without proper tracking mechanisms would be unmanageable, so we worked on integrating systems like Salesforce, Calendly, and potentially HubSpot (for email campaigns).

During this time, Riley concentrated on creating campaign materials, with much of the focus on collateral and website development. However, communication gaps arose, with Riley reaching out sporadically and requesting multiple items at once, followed by a lack of follow-up. This caused some delays.

In our mid-August EOS meeting, it was decided that the project should pause until a discovery call template was finalized. This became a priority before investing in marketing efforts. Given the performance of my division, I have been cautious in asking for additional resources, but upcoming events will better position me to make these requests.

It's important to note that Riley was serving as my marketing liaison, and when my focus shifted to more pressing tasks, progress on this initiative slowed significantly. I take responsibility for at least half of this stall.

---

### **Path Forward**
1. **Summary Preparation:** I will compile a summary of the work completed thus far.
2. **Updated Strategies:** My summary will include updated strategies based on insights gained over the last three months.
3. **Next Steps:** This summary will serve as the foundation from which we can restart the process. I will have it ready for you by Monday.

---

### **Next Steps**
I propose scheduling a "Soft Reset" meeting, potentially in person at the office on Tuesday. During this meeting, I will present the material and strategies I’ve prepared.

Lastly, Colin, it may be beneficial for us to conduct this meeting without you initially. Once we’ve consolidated the work and developed a clear, actionable plan, we can schedule a follow-up meeting with you.
