For Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25), Maryland's Commercial Clean Energy Rebate Program (C-CERP) is being replaced by the **Commercial Solar Pilot Program**. This new program will offer incentives for commercial solar installations, with expected rebates of up to $30,000 per project, similar to the previous C-CERP. The program aims to be launched in the summer of 2024, with more details forthcoming. The focus remains on promoting solar adoption among businesses, non-profits, and local governments, aligning with Maryland’s goals for clean energy and sustainability【6†source】【7†source】.

In addition to this, Maryland continues to support solar development through other programs like the **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)** and property tax exemptions for solar installations, which remain key incentives【6†source】.
