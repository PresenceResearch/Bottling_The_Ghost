please write a short email to Paul Reed Smith, of Paul Reed Smith guitars asking to introduce him to my daughter who works at a solar company and ask him if he would take a 10 minute call from her about potentially installing solar panels on his factory in Maryland.  Here is some context below.  Alright so my mom, Lori Yates, and Paul went to Bowie Senior High School together. She started working for the Susan G. Komen organization after her bout with breast cancer and was finally in remission. Paul's wife had breast cancer as well but she can't remember her name. My mom worked on a charity event called Concert for the Cure that ran 3 years in a row. Paul and his band performed and he also donated guitars each year. She worked and communicated with him direct as well as his personal assistant but she doesn't know if his assistant would be the same person she has in her emails. 

I didn't know they went to high school together so that's a BIG plus!!!

Dear Paul,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I’m Lori Yates' daughter. I recently learned that you and my mom went to Bowie Senior High together, which was such a pleasant surprise! She speaks very fondly of the time you worked together on the Concert for the Cure events and remembers how generous you were with both your time and donations.

I work in the solar industry, and I wanted to introduce you to my daughter, [Your Daughter’s Name], who is also in the solar field. She is passionate about helping businesses go solar, and I was wondering if you might be open to a quick 10-minute call with her to discuss the possibility of installing solar panels at your factory in Maryland.

If this is something you’d be interested in exploring, please let me know, and I can coordinate the introduction.

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,

Dear Paul,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s been quite a while since we last connected. I wanted to reach out and say how much I still appreciate the time you dedicated to the Concert for the Cure events all those years ago. Your generosity with both your performances and guitar donations was truly inspiring, and it made a big impact on our efforts. I often think back fondly to those years and the support you provided.

I also wanted to introduce you to my daughter, [Your Daughter's Name], who works for a solar company here in Maryland. She’s passionate about renewable energy and helping businesses transition to solar. I thought PRS Guitars might be a great candidate, and I was wondering if you’d be open to a brief 10-minute conversation with her to discuss the potential for installing solar panels at your factory.

If this sounds like something you'd consider, please let me know, and I’d be happy to connect the two of you.

Thank you again for all you’ve done, and I hope we can catch up soon!

Warmly,  
Lori Yates

Dear Paul,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s been a long time since we worked together on the Concert for the Cure events, and I wanted to express my gratitude again for all of your support. Your performances and generous guitar donations were instrumental in making those events successful. I often think back on those years with fondness and appreciation.

I also wanted to introduce you to my daughter, [Your Daughter’s Name], who works in the solar industry here in Maryland. She’s passionate about helping businesses like PRS Guitars transition to renewable energy. I know your Maryland factory is the heart of your operations, and with PRS’s constant innovations, like the new models in the 2024 SE Series lineup, it seems like a perfect fit to explore solar energy options for the factory.

If you’re open to the idea, would you be willing to take a quick 10-minute call with her to discuss the possibility of installing solar panels at your facility?

Thank you for considering this, and I hope we can reconnect soon!

Warmly,  
Lori Yates

The new 2024 PRS SE Series models, particularly the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special, have been well-received by the guitar community. These models build on PRS's reputation for combining quality craftsmanship with innovative design. For example, the SE CE 24 marks the first time the CE model is available in the SE line, and the Swamp Ash Special returns with fresh features, both of which showcase PRS's continued focus on versatility and player-friendly design【13†source】【14†source】.

The reception in terms of sales and reviews suggests that these models are successful. They offer players an affordable yet high-quality option, with attention to details like the ergonomic heel design and improved tonal versatility, which have been highlighted in reviews【14†source】. Additionally, the inclusion of signature PRS elements, like the 85/15 pickups and innovative tremolo systems, further reinforces their popularity, especially among both professional musicians and hobbyists【15†source】.

In summary, the 2024 models appear to be doing well in the market, appreciated for their balance of quality, affordability, and PRS’s characteristic attention to innovation.
