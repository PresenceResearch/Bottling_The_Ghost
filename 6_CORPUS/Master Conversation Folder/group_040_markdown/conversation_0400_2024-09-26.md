The criteria for Section 3 properties, in the context of environmental justice programs for solar and wind energy capacity, refer to properties that qualify for allocations under the low-income communities bonus credit program. According to the document, Section 3 criteria pertain to how capacity limitations are allocated and the qualifications for receiving increased energy credits.

Key points include:

1. **Eligibility for Capacity Limitation Allocations**: Facilities must be part of a solar or wind project located in or benefiting specific categories, including low-income communities, Indian lands, or other qualified low-income residential and economic benefit projects.

2. **Specific Categories**:
   - **Category 1**: Located in a low-income community.
   - **Category 2**: Located on Indian land.
   - **Category 3**: Qualified low-income residential building project.
   - **Category 4**: Qualified low-income economic benefit project.

3. **Sub-Reservations for Residential Facilities**: Within Category 1, there are further subdivisions, such as allocations specifically for behind-the-meter facilities like residential rooftop solar.

4. **Application Requirements**: To apply, owners must submit detailed information about the facility, such as its location, capacity, and contractual agreements, and provide attestations that the project meets the qualifications for the allocated credits.

5. **Additional Selection Criteria**: Some facilities can receive priority if they meet additional criteria, such as being owned by tribal enterprises, renewable energy cooperatives, or tax-exempt organizations, or if located in persistent poverty areas.

If you are seeking more detailed guidance on specific documentation or processes for applying under Section 3, I can provide further clarification or assistance.

Categories 3 and 4 under the low-income communities bonus credit program are defined as specific facility categories that qualify for allocations of environmental justice solar and wind capacity limitations. Here's a more detailed breakdown of each:

### **Category 3: Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project**
This category is for solar or wind facilities installed on or serving low-income residential buildings. The focus here is on projects that directly benefit low-income households by providing renewable energy, typically at reduced costs.

- **Eligibility Requirements:**
  - The facility must be part of a "qualified low-income residential building project." This usually includes multi-family housing units or apartment buildings where a significant portion of the tenants are low-income residents.
  - There is an emphasis on ensuring that the energy produced directly benefits the residents of these buildings, either by reducing their energy costs or increasing their access to renewable energy resources.
  
- **Required Documentation:**
  - Proof that the property will be installed on a qualified low-income residential building is necessary.
  - A **Benefits Sharing Statement** is also required, which demonstrates how the financial benefits from the project will be distributed to the low-income residents. This could be in the form of utility bill credits, reductions in electricity rates, or other financial advantages.

### **Category 4: Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project**
This category is aimed at solar or wind facilities that provide economic benefits to low-income households in terms of reduced utility costs or other economic advantages. The facilities under this category may serve multiple households or communities, rather than being limited to a specific residential building.

- **Eligibility Requirements:**
  - At least 50% of the facility’s total kilowatt output must be assigned to qualified low-income households.
  - The project must offer a minimum **20% bill credit discount rate** for the low-income households. The discount rate is the difference between the financial benefit provided (e.g., utility bill credits or reduced rates) and the cost of participating in the program (e.g., subscription fees for renewable energy).
  
- **Required Documentation:**
  - Similar to Category 3, applicants must provide a list of the low-income households that will benefit from the project, along with the method of income verification used to qualify them.
  - A spreadsheet demonstrating the expected financial benefits to the low-income subscribers, which will show how the 20% bill credit discount rate is achieved.

### **Federal Assistance Requirements**
For both Categories 3 and 4, federal assistance requirements focus on ensuring that the projects serve low-income communities and provide tangible economic benefits. This involves:

1. **Low-Income Households**: The households benefiting from the projects must meet certain income thresholds to qualify as "low-income" under federal guidelines. This is typically defined by federal poverty guidelines or a percentage of the area's median income.
   
2. **Consumer Protection**: Applicants are required to ensure that any low-income households or offtakers receive appropriate consumer disclosures, informing them of their legal rights and protections before they agree to participate in the project.

3. **Documentation for Compliance**: To qualify for these allocations, facilities must provide significant documentation, including contracts, benefits sharing statements, and income verification processes to ensure compliance with federal assistance rules.

**Assistant:**

To identify properties that match Section 3 criteria within Equity Emphasis Areas in Montgomery County, MD, you can use the **Equity Emphasis Areas Map** provided by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC). The map highlights areas with higher concentrations of low-income and minority populations, which may align with Section 3 property qualifications for solar or wind energy projects. 

Visit the map here for specific locations: [NCPC Equity Emphasis Areas Map](https://www.ncpc.gov/maps/equity-emphasis/). You can cross-reference these locations with qualified properties under Section 3.

I currently do not have the capability to search for specific properties or add them to the map directly. However, you can use the **Equity Emphasis Areas Map** on the NCPC website to visually identify eligible locations. 

To find properties that meet Section 3 criteria in Montgomery County, MD:
1. Cross-reference low-income housing or properties eligible for solar/wind installations with the areas marked on the Equity Emphasis Map.
2. Use local property databases or county GIS tools to identify ownership and qualification.

For a more automated search, I recommend partnering with local planning or permit offices to access property databases for eligible solar projects.
