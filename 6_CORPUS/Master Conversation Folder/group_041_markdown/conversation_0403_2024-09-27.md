How would
You describe the style of halfway crooks

**Assistant:**

"Halfway Crooks" by Mobb Deep has a distinct style that blends gritty realism with a raw, streetwise edge. Here's how you could describe its style:

- **Genre:** East Coast Hip-Hop, specifically 1990s boom bap.
- **Tone:** Hard-hitting, confrontational, and unapologetic.
- **Vibe:** Dark, intense, with a sense of paranoia and survival.
- **Lyrical Delivery:** Aggressive, sharp, and unfiltered with a focus on street life, struggle, and resilience.
- **Beat:** Heavy basslines, looped samples, and punchy drums that create a stark, almost haunting atmosphere.

It captures the essence of 90s New York rap, where authenticity and storytelling about the harsh realities of life were paramount. The style is both rebellious and reflective, designed to embody the experience of living through hardship with a defiant attitude.
