The dataset contains billing information from a utility company, likely Pepco, and seems to include usage data for specific accounts and locations. It spans multiple months of both 2023 and 2024. Here's a quick summary of the key columns identified:

- **Unnamed: 0 to Unnamed: 8**: The first few columns appear to contain account and location details, with columns like "Vendors", "Account #", and potentially descriptions like "sanctuary/chapel".
- **2023 and 2024**: These columns contain monthly usage or billing data, with specific months like "Jan", "Feb", etc., represented across 2023 and 2024.
- There are values in some of the columns for monthly billing amounts, which increase over time.

It seems like you'd like an analysis of the data. I could clean this dataset, provide summaries (monthly usage or totals per account), and visualize trends. Would you like me to proceed with any specific analyses, such as:

1. **Total Usage per Location** 🏠
2. **Monthly Usage Trends** 📈
3. **Average Usage per Month** 🧮
4. **Custom Analysis** ✨

Let me know which you'd like!
