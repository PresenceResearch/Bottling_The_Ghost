            "It seems like you're asking about AI song generators or makers, possibly comparing tools like \"Suno\" and \"Donna.\" While both may refer to platforms or AI tools, here\u2019s a brief look at AI-driven music makers:\n\n1. **Suno**: Suno is an AI-powered tool focused on generating music, speech, and sound effects. It uses machine learning algorithms to compose original tracks or elements based on user input, often providing creative and high-quality results.\n\n2. **Donna**: This might refer to a different AI music tool or platform, though it's not as widely known in the AI music generation space. There are several AI platforms out there with names that might sound similar, and it's possible that \"Donna\" could be an internal or lesser-known tool. If it's specific to a certain service, let me know!\n\nBoth tools aim to streamline the music creation process through the use of AI, giving users the ability to create unique compositions without traditional musical skills.\n\nIs there something specific you're trying to achieve with these tools? Or would you like more information on other AI music makers?"

Suno for iOS allows users to easily create their own music by simply providing text descriptions or recording audio with their phone. Users can generate 4-minute-long songs and 2-minute-long song extensions.\n\n> At Suno, we're on a mission to build a future where everyone can make and share music. We prize originality, both in how we build our product and in how people use it. We\u2019re excited that for the first time ever, these joys can be experienced from your phone! - Suno Team\n\nIn December of last year, \u301088\u2020Suno released\u3011 a plugin for Microsoft Copilot, enabling Copilot users to create their own songs with simple text prompts. Recently, Suno also introduced a new Audio Input feature, allowing users to make a song from any sound. To do this, users can record or upload an audio clip between 6 and 60 seconds in length, then use the \"Extend\" feature to set a timestamp, choose a genre, and provide their own lyrics to generate new extended audio.\n\nThe Suno app for iOS devices is available for download from the Apple App Store, but currently only in the US. The team is actively working to expand Suno for iOS availability to other regions and develop an Android version of the app. While the Suno app is free to download, the number of songs you can create depends on your chosen subscription plan. The free Basic plan provides 50 free credits per day, and you can choose from one of the following paid plans depending on your usage:\n\n  * 1-month Pro Plan - $10/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-month Premier Plan - $30/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-year Pro Plan - $96/year (20% off monthly), billed annually\n  * 1-year Premier Plan - $289",

Suno for iOS allows users to easily create their own music by simply providing text descriptions or recording audio with their phone. Users can generate 4-minute-long songs and 2-minute-long song extensions.\n\n> At Suno, we're on a mission to build a future where everyone can make and share music. We prize originality, both in how we build our product and in how people use it. We\u2019re excited that for the first time ever, these joys can be experienced from your phone! - Suno Team\n\nIn December of last year, \u301088\u2020Suno released\u3011 a plugin for Microsoft Copilot, enabling Copilot users to create their own songs with simple text prompts. Recently, Suno also introduced a new Audio Input feature, allowing users to make a song from any sound. To do this, users can record or upload an audio clip between 6 and 60 seconds in length, then use the \"Extend\" feature to set a timestamp, choose a genre, and provide their own lyrics to generate new extended audio.\n\nThe Suno app for iOS devices is available for download from the Apple App Store, but currently only in the US. The team is actively working to expand Suno for iOS availability to other regions and develop an Android version of the app. While the Suno app is free to download, the number of songs you can create depends on your chosen subscription plan. The free Basic plan provides 50 free credits per day, and you can choose from one of the following paid plans depending on your usage:\n\n  * 1-month Pro Plan - $10/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-month Premier Plan - $30/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-year Pro Plan - $96/year (20% off monthly), billed annually\n  * 1-year Premier Plan - $289",

Suno for iOS allows users to easily create their own music by simply providing text descriptions or recording audio with their phone. Users can generate 4-minute-long songs and 2-minute-long song extensions.\n\n> At Suno, we're on a mission to build a future where everyone can make and share music. We prize originality, both in how we build our product and in how people use it. We\u2019re excited that for the first time ever, these joys can be experienced from your phone! - Suno Team\n\nIn December of last year, \u301088\u2020Suno released\u3011 a plugin for Microsoft Copilot, enabling Copilot users to create their own songs with simple text prompts. Recently, Suno also introduced a new Audio Input feature, allowing users to make a song from any sound. To do this, users can record or upload an audio clip between 6 and 60 seconds in length, then use the \"Extend\" feature to set a timestamp, choose a genre, and provide their own lyrics to generate new extended audio.\n\nThe Suno app for iOS devices is available for download from the Apple App Store, but currently only in the US. The team is actively working to expand Suno for iOS availability to other regions and develop an Android version of the app. While the Suno app is free to download, the number of songs you can create depends on your chosen subscription plan. The free Basic plan provides 50 free credits per day, and you can choose from one of the following paid plans depending on your usage:\n\n  * 1-month Pro Plan - $10/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-month Premier Plan - $30/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-year Pro Plan - $96/year (20% off monthly), billed annually\n  * 1-year Premier Plan - $289",

Suno for iOS allows users to easily create their own music by simply providing text descriptions or recording audio with their phone. Users can generate 4-minute-long songs and 2-minute-long song extensions.\n\n> At Suno, we're on a mission to build a future where everyone can make and share music. We prize originality, both in how we build our product and in how people use it. We\u2019re excited that for the first time ever, these joys can be experienced from your phone! - Suno Team\n\nIn December of last year, \u301088\u2020Suno released\u3011 a plugin for Microsoft Copilot, enabling Copilot users to create their own songs with simple text prompts. Recently, Suno also introduced a new Audio Input feature, allowing users to make a song from any sound. To do this, users can record or upload an audio clip between 6 and 60 seconds in length, then use the \"Extend\" feature to set a timestamp, choose a genre, and provide their own lyrics to generate new extended audio.\n\nThe Suno app for iOS devices is available for download from the Apple App Store, but currently only in the US. The team is actively working to expand Suno for iOS availability to other regions and develop an Android version of the app. While the Suno app is free to download, the number of songs you can create depends on your chosen subscription plan. The free Basic plan provides 50 free credits per day, and you can choose from one of the following paid plans depending on your usage:\n\n  * 1-month Pro Plan - $10/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-month Premier Plan - $30/month, billed monthly\n  * 1-year Pro Plan - $96/year (20% off monthly), billed annually\n  * 1-year Premier Plan - $289"
