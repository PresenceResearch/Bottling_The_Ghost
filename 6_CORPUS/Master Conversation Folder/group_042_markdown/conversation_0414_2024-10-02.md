Known for her warm and assertive sound, she has performed with prestigious ensembles like the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, American Ballet Theatre, and Vermont Symphony Orchestra, where she has been the principal horn since 1999. She has also been part of more than a dozen Broadway productions, including *Mary Poppins* and *Disney’s Frozen*【10†source】【12†source】.

Beyond her performances, Shelagh is a dedicated educator, serving as an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a faculty member at the Boston University Tanglewood Institute.

**“Shelagh’s Song”**

She grew up in Massapequa,  
With dreams as big as the sky.  
Went to Boston College, chasing knowledge,  
Not once, not twice, but three times,  
Always reaching for the stars, flying high.

She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh,  
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind,  
She’s my freedom, my best friend, my other half,  
In her, the truest love I find.

Cookie calls her “Not Dad,” that’s how it goes,  
But Cookie loves her, from head to toes.  
She’s stylish, beautiful, short, and loud,  
With long hair flowing, standing proud.

Her laugh fills the room, her spirit shines,  
She burps a lot, but I don’t mind.  
She’s my Space Jam partner, through thick and thin,  
With her, I feel like I always win.
