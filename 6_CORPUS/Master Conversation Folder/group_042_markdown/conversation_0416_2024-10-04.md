Yes, cost segregation can affect the ability to take bonus depreciation on a solar array, and it can be a beneficial strategy. Here’s how it works:

**Cost Segregation Overview:**
Cost segregation is a tax planning strategy that allows businesses to reclassify certain components of a building or property into shorter depreciation categories. Normally, buildings are depreciated over 39 years (for commercial property) or 27.5 years (for residential property), but certain assets within the property, such as equipment, fixtures, and solar arrays, can be classified as personal property and depreciated over shorter time periods (like 5, 7, or 15 years).

**Bonus Depreciation and Solar:**
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, businesses can claim **bonus depreciation** on qualifying assets, which allows for 100% immediate depreciation in the first year of service. Solar energy systems qualify as equipment under MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) with a 5-year depreciation schedule, so they are eligible for bonus depreciation as well.

**Impact of Cost Segregation:**
When you conduct a cost segregation study on a property that includes a solar array, the study helps to break down various components into the appropriate shorter depreciation categories. Solar arrays, being categorized as equipment, can already benefit from 100% bonus depreciation in the year the system is placed in service (as long as the property is eligible for it and bonus depreciation is still available at that rate). 

**Additional Benefits:**
Cost segregation could reveal other assets (besides the solar array itself) that are eligible for bonus depreciation, further maximizing your tax savings in the year the solar array is installed.

In conclusion, cost segregation won't affect your ability to take bonus depreciation on the solar array directly, but it can enhance your tax strategy by identifying other assets for accelerated depreciation alongside the solar installation.
