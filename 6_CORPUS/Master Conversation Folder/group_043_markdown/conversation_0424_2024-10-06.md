Your trip to Iceland sounds amazing! Here’s how to make the most of it, especially for viewing the northern lights:

1. **Where to Stay**:
   - **South or West Iceland**: Regions like the Snaefellsnes Peninsula or around the small towns of Borgarnes or Vik are great for remote stays. These areas are far from city lights and offer spectacular views.
   - **Cabins**: Look for cabins or small houses on platforms like Airbnb, Vrbo, or specialized sites like **Buubble** or **Icelandic Cottages**. These cabins often come with large windows or even glass domes for aurora viewing.
   - **Thingvellir National Park**: This UNESCO site is both remote and beautiful, offering great landscapes for the Northern Lights.

2. **When to See the Northern Lights**:
   - December to January is peak season for the northern lights in Iceland. The key is to have clear skies and low light pollution.
   - Use apps like **My Aurora Forecast** or **Vedur.is** (Iceland’s weather service) to track aurora activity.

3. **Activities**:
   - **Explore Ice Caves**: December is the perfect time for exploring Iceland’s crystal blue ice caves in the Vatnajökull Glacier.
   - **Snowmobiling or Dog Sledding**: Consider an adventure with snowmobiles or dog sledding in areas like Langjökull Glacier.
   - **Hot Springs**: After a day in the cold, warm up in a hot spring. Popular options include the **Secret Lagoon** or **Hrunalaug**, both offering a more secluded experience than the Blue Lagoon.
   - **Golden Circle Tour**: If you have time, you can still explore some of Iceland’s famous spots like Gullfoss Waterfall, Geysir, and Thingvellir, which are relatively close to some remote areas.

4. **Transport**:
   - Renting a 4x4 is a good idea in December due to snow and ice conditions on the roads. Make sure it’s equipped for winter driving.

5. **Safety Tips**:
   - Always check the weather and road conditions before heading out. In winter, storms can come quickly, making some areas impassable. The website **safetravel.is** has updated info on road and weather safety.

With some luck, you’ll have incredible views of the northern lights and enjoy Iceland's serene, snowy landscapes!

Both **Vrbo** and **Airbnb** are excellent platforms, but which is better for your Iceland trip depends on what you're looking for. Here's a comparison based on factors that matter for your stay:

### 1. **Property Types**:
   - **Vrbo**: Primarily focuses on entire homes, which might suit you better if you're looking for a private cabin or house in a remote area.
   - **Airbnb**: Offers a wider variety of property types, including shared spaces and unique stays like glass domes or yurts. If you’re interested in something more unconventional, Airbnb might be worth exploring.

### 2. **Remote Locations**:
   - **Vrbo**: Often better for vacation homes and cabins in more remote or rural areas, which might align well with your preference for a secluded stay.
   - **Airbnb**: Airbnb has more listings in city and suburban areas, but it also offers remote options, especially in Iceland.

### 3. **Pricing & Fees**:
   - **Vrbo**: Typically charges a lower service fee compared to Airbnb. However, cleaning fees and taxes may vary depending on the property.
   - **Airbnb**: While there are more budget options on Airbnb, they tend to have higher service fees. Make sure to compare the total cost, including cleaning and service fees, before booking.

### 4. **Host Interaction**:
   - **Vrbo**: Typically more professional or corporate hosts, as it caters to entire homes and vacation rentals.
   - **Airbnb**: You’ll find a mix of individual hosts and vacation rental companies. Airbnb hosts often provide more personal touches like local guides or personal recommendations.

### 5. **Cancellation Policies**:
   - **Vrbo**: Offers more lenient cancellation policies, especially for vacation homes, which can be useful if you need flexibility due to weather or other travel plans.
   - **Airbnb**: Has stricter cancellation policies depending on the host, so make sure to double-check before booking.

### 6. **Unique Features**:
   - **Vrbo**: Often better for larger groups or families because it tends to list larger homes and full properties.
   - **Airbnb**: Airbnb offers “Experiences,” which could give you the chance to book local activities directly through the platform, such as northern lights tours or glacier hikes.

### Conclusion:
- **Vrbo** might be better if you want a secluded, fully private cabin or house with a simpler booking process and lower fees.
- **Airbnb** could be better if you're seeking a unique stay (like a glass cabin) or you want the flexibility of both budget and high-end options, plus the added bonus of unique local experiences.

Given your preferences for a remote stay, you may want to start with **Vrbo** for the best cabin options, but also check Airbnb for any unique or alternative properties.
