The IRS provides guidance regarding the Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under **IRS Notice 2013-70**, which clarifies how certain costs associated with solar installations may be included in the calculation of the credit. Specifically, the guidance allows the inclusion of certain roofing costs, but only if the work is "integral to" the installation of solar panels. For instance, if a new roof or specific structural improvements are necessary to support the solar installation, those costs may be eligible.

However, general roof replacements or repairs that are not required for the solar installation, or are simply incidental, do not qualify for the ITC. The IRS distinguishes between costs that are integral to the solar energy system and those that are merely routine improvements or repairs.

Here's how the costs may be treated:
1. **Eligible Costs**: If the roofing work is necessary to install the solar system (such as structural support or specific modifications required for panel installation), it could be partially included in the ITC.
2. **Non-Eligible Costs**: General roof replacement or unrelated repairs are not eligible for the tax credit.

The tax credit can generally only apply to the portion of roofing costs that directly relate to the solar installation.

For specific cases, it's recommended to consult a tax professional or reference IRS Notice 2013-70 to determine how much of the roofing cost can qualify for the tax credit based on the nature of the solar installation.

Would you like me to link any additional IRS materials or summarize specific parts of the notice?

You can access **IRS Notice 2013-70**, which provides detailed guidance on tax credits related to nonbusiness energy property under § 25C and residential energy-efficient property under § 25D, including how to treat roofing costs associated with solar installations. This notice is essential when determining what roofing expenses qualify as part of the solar installation for the Federal tax credit.

Here is the link to the full notice: [IRS Notice 2013-70](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USIRS/bulletins/935a24)【9†source】【10†source】. 

Please review it for specific details on how to treat roofing work in the context of the solar ITC, and consider consulting with a tax advisor for your specific situation.

where is the roof addressed?

**Assistant:**

In **Notice 2013-70**, roofing costs are addressed in **Q&A 8** (Section 3) under labor costs for energy-efficient building envelope components. Specifically, it states that labor costs related to the installation of energy-efficient roofing do **not** qualify for the tax credit under §25C. This means that while energy-efficient materials themselves (such as those designed to reduce heat loss or gain) can qualify, the labor costs for installing such materials on the roof do not qualify for the credit. 

However, under §25D, labor costs associated with the onsite preparation, assembly, or installation of **solar electric property** (including the integration of the system with the roof) are eligible for the tax credit.

Thus, if a roof repair or installation is integral to supporting the solar panels, the costs associated with the portion of the roof that directly accommodates the solar panels may be considered part of the overall qualified expenditure for the solar tax credit.
