To check if you’re connected to a WiFi extender, follow these steps:

1. **Check the WiFi network name (SSID):**
   - Many WiFi extenders create a new network with a similar name to your main router but add something like "_EXT" or "-EXT" to differentiate. If you’re connected to this network, you are on the extender.
   - If your extender uses the same SSID as your main router, move closer to the extender to see if the signal strength improves. If it does, you’re likely connected to the extender.

2. **Check signal strength:**
   - On your device (phone, tablet, laptop), look at the WiFi icon. If you're far from your main router but still have a strong signal, it’s a good indication that you’re connected to the extender.

3. **Device Settings:**
   - Some extenders allow you to log into their settings via a browser to view which devices are connected. You can access this by entering the extender’s IP address (usually found in the manual) into your browser.

4. **Use a WiFi analyzer app:**
   - There are apps available (such as "WiFi Analyzer" or "Fing") that allow you to see details about your connection, including which access point (main router or extender) you’re connected to.

By following these steps, you can confirm whether you're connected to the WiFi extender.
