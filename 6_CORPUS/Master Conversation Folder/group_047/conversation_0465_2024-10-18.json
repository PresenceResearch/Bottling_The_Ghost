          "text": "\nWILMINGTON \u2014\u00a0 Delaware has joined the growing number of states who are preparing an infrastructure for future\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind projects. Governor Carney signed\u00a0Senate Bill 265, \u201cThe Delaware Energy Solutions Act of 2024\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0along with several other environmental and energy policy bills \u2014\u00a0Thursday morning at the Dupont Environmental Education Center in the presence of legislators and advocates.\n\nChampioned by\u00a0Sen. Stephanie Hansen, SB 265 creates a framework for the State of Delaware to solicit and give approval for\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind projects along our coastlines.\n\n\u201cWhile Senate Bill 265 does not automatically give the green light for any\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind projects to move forward, it does lay out the specific terms and conditions under which the State of Delaware would be willing to permit a cost-effective\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind project to move forward and help secure a cleaner, more sustainable future for our children and grandchildren,\u201d Sen. Hansen explained. \u201cThis legislation is the product of careful consideration and input from multiple state agencies, industry experts, energy researchers and environmental advocates, and I want to thank all of the people who worked so hard over many years to help us reach this important milestone.\u201d\n\nRep. Debra Heffernan, Chair of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, served as the House prime sponsor for this legislation.\n\n\u201cThe passage of SB 265 will open the door to\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind energy procurement in our state. This is a monumental step toward embracing a cleaner, more sustainable future, and helps to ensure that we stay on track to meet the targets outlined in the Climate Solutions Act,\u201d said Rep. Heffernan. \u201cIt will take time before we see a turbine in Delaware, but this is still a huge feat. We have now begun the process to ensure that Delaware is ready to make the switch to clean energy when the best opportunity presents itself. Thank you to all of my colleagues who have worked with me to ensure this bill reflects the best interests of our environment and the citizens of our beautiful state.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn addition to partners across state government, SB 265 was developed in partnership with climate advocates from a number of local and regional organizations.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe responsible development of\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind and the transition to renewable energy is essential for the protection of wildlife, habitats, and communities from the havoc of climate change,\u201d said\u00a0Amber Hewett, Senior Director of\u00a0Offshore\u00a0Wind Energy at the National Wildlife Federation.\u00a0\u201cAs one of the nation\u2019s most abundant clean energy resources,\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind energy will help stabilize rates, increase energy reliability, and help Delaware achieve its clean energy goals. Our continued reliance on harmful fossil fuels is increasing global temperatures, forcing migration patterns to change, and impacting food chains for marine wildlife. Responsible\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind energy is the future, and Delaware is on its way to becoming a leading partner in this endeavor.\u201d\n\nGov. John Carney signed SB 265 alongside other energy policy bills, including legislation that further develops the state\u2019s electric vehicle infrastructure, expands access to solar, and requires county governments to factor climate change into their comprehensive plans.\n\n\u201cI have said for many years that new sources of energy like\u00a0offshore\u00a0wind are essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and countering the impacts of climate change,\u201d said Gov. John Carney. \u201cThis legislation will allow us to purchase wind-generated renewable energy in a fiscally responsible way so that we can continue to work toward those goals. I want to thank the members of the General Assembly and environmental advocates for their hard work and support.\u201d\n\n###\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * \u301020\u2020Environment\u3011\n, \n  * \u301021\u2020offshore wind\u3011\n\n## News\n\n* * *\n\nOct 3 2024\n\n###  \u301022\u2020McBride Protects Medicaid for Future Generations\u3011 \n\nOctober 3, 2024\n\n\u30103\u2020News Releases\u3011 \n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | October 3, 2024 Contact: Sarah Fulton (302) 401-1114 WILMINGTON \u2014 Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Sen.

Food establishments in Delaware also would be prohibited from providing single-use plastic straws unless requested by a customer, while single-use plastic coffee stirrers, cocktail picks and sandwich picks would be banned entirely.\n\nThe House passed a series of amendments to the bill on Thursday that removed exceptions on polystyrene use by fire companies and nonprofit organizations, narrowed an exception given to healthcare providers, clarified that no food establishment\u2019s license may be suspended or revoked for violating the bill and delayed any monetary penalties for one year. All of those amendments were included in the version passed by the Senate on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI want to thank my colleagues in the House for working with me to get this legislation across the finish line,\u201d said Sen. Paradee. \u201cWe have a responsibility to future generations to reduce the amount of these harmful products entering our environment and our bodies.

The bill also would require the Delaware Department of Education to submit an annual report and a final report in 2030 detailing recommendations for future electric vehicle purchases and other steps to reduce the environmental impact of the state\u2019s school transportation fleet.\n\nSponsored by Rep. Heffernan and Sen. Russell Huxtable, \u301025\u2020House Bill 11\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011 would require new commercial buildings with a foundation footprint of 50,000 square feet or greater to meet standards that ensure the roof is able to support solar infrastructure. The bill would apply to construction projects seeking a building permit after Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nSponsored by Rep. Sophie Phillips and Sen. Sarah McBride, \u301026\u2020House Bill 12\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011 would codify an existing Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offered through the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) since 2014. Under the bill, the program would allow consumers to seek a rebate of up to $2,500 on the purchase of an electric vehicle and up to $1,000 for a hybrid vehicle that is valued at up to $60,000.\n\nFour other environmentally focused measures are still being considered by the General Assembly:\n\n\u301027\u2020House Bill 8\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Rep. Ed Osienski and Sen.

Krista Griffith and Sen. McBride, would set goals for all state-owned and operated passenger and light-duty vehicles to be zero emission by 2040. HB 9 is awaiting consideration by\u00a0the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u301029\u2020Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 103\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Sen. McBride and Rep. Phillips, would require that newly constructed single- and multi-family residential dwellings include certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure. SS 1 for SB 103 passed the Senate in May and was released for consideration by the full House earlier this month.\n\n\u301030\u2020Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 7\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Sen.

All of those amendments were included in the version passed by the Senate on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI want to thank my colleagues in the House for working with me to get this legislation across the finish line,\u201d said Sen. Paradee. \u201cWe have a responsibility to future generations to reduce the amount of these harmful products entering our environment and our bodies. As a coastal state with a vibrant tourism industry, the time has finally come for us to join other states in banning these products and setting a good example for our children to follow.\u201d\n\nSponsored by Rep. Heffernan and Sen. Hansen, \u301024\u2020House Bill 10\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011 would establish targets for the annual purchase of state-owned electric school buses through Fiscal Year 2030 that would gradually increase the percentage of electric buses in the fleet. The bill also would require the Delaware Department of Education to submit an annual report and a final report in 2030 detailing recommendations for future electric vehicle purchases and other steps to reduce the environmental impact of the state\u2019s school transportation fleet.\n\nSponsored by Rep. Heffernan and Sen. Russell Huxtable, \u301025\u2020House Bill 11\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011 would require new commercial buildings with a foundation footprint of 50,000 square feet or greater to meet standards that ensure the roof is able to support solar infrastructure. The bill would apply to construction projects seeking a building permit after Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nSponsored by Rep. Sophie Phillips and Sen. Sarah McBride, \u301026\u2020House Bill 12\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011 would codify an existing Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offered through the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) since 2014. Under the bill, the program would allow consumers to seek a rebate of up to $2,500 on the purchase of an electric vehicle and up to $1,000 for a hybrid vehicle that is valued at up to $60,000.\n\nFour other environmentally focused measures are still being considered by the General Assembly:\n\n\u301027\u2020House Bill 8\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Rep. Ed Osienski and Sen. Jack Walsh, would direct state agencies to develop and implement \u201cclean construction preferences\u201d that allow sustainability and carbon-impact data to be considered in awarding public contracts. HB 8 was released by the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee in May and remains on the House Ready List.\n\n\u301028\u2020House Bill 9\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Rep. Krista Griffith and Sen. McBride, would set goals for all state-owned and operated passenger and light-duty vehicles to be zero emission by 2040. HB 9 is awaiting consideration by\u00a0the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u301029\u2020Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 103\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Sen. McBride and Rep. Phillips, would require that newly constructed single- and multi-family residential dwellings include certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure. SS 1 for SB 103 passed the Senate in May and was released for consideration by the full House earlier this month.\n\n\u301030\u2020Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 7\u2020legis.delaware.gov\u3011, sponsored by Sen. Hansen and Rep. Heffernan, would strengthen the ability of the Delaware Energy Office to serve as the lead agency on a variety of climate and energy issues. SS 1 for SB 7 is awaiting final action on the House Ready List.\n\n###\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * \u301031\u2020electric vehicles\u3011\n, \n  * \u301032\u2020Greenhouse Gas Emissions\u3011\n, \n  * \u301033\u2020polystyrene\u3011\n, \n  * \u301034\u2020solar energy\u3011\n\n## News\n\n* * *\n\nOct 3 2024\n\n###  \u301035\u2020McBride Protects Medicaid for Future Generations\u3011 \n\nOctober 3, 2024\n\n\u30103\u2020News Releases\u3011 \n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | October 3, 2024 Contact: Sarah Fulton (302) 401-1114 WILMINGTON \u2014 Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Sen.

            "The proposed changes regarding contractor education and licensure requirements for Delaware's Green Energy Program have not yet been officially passed into law. These changes, which mandate that contractors maintain relevant training, submit licenses, and obtain industry-recognized certifications every three years, are part of ongoing regulatory updates aimed at improving the quality and oversight of renewable energy installations within the state. The new rules would suspend contractors who fail to comply with these requirements until they provide the necessary documentation. \n\nHowever, Delaware has recently passed other environmental and energy-related legislation, such as the Delaware Energy Solutions Act of 2024, which focuses on renewable energy infrastructure, but no specific update confirming the adoption of the particular licensure requirements you mentioned has been documented as of now\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30108\u2020source\u3011. \n\nFor the most current status, it might be helpful to check directly with Delaware's Division of Climate, Coastal, and Energy or the DNREC Green Energy Program."
