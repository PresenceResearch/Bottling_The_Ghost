Regulation **27 DE Reg. 885 (effective May 1, 2024)** refers to updates and clarifications to Delaware’s Board of Electrical Examiners rules. Specifically, it outlines various procedures related to electrical licensure, including updates on homeowners’ permits, inspection agency requirements, and duties of licensees. 

Key aspects of the regulation include:
1. **Homeowners’ Permits**: Permits are required for new electrical construction or renovations in non-commercial settings. Homeowners performing their own electrical work must submit detailed plans for review by an approved inspection agency before receiving the permit.
   
2. **Inspection Agencies**: Agencies conducting electrical inspections must hold proper licensure and insurance, and they must ensure their inspections adhere to the National Electrical Code and local building codes.

3. **Licensing and Insurance**: The regulation also emphasizes maintaining adequate liability insurance for electricians and sets forth experience requirements for license applicants.

These updates are intended to ensure electrical safety and proper oversight within Delaware, particularly in residential settings, and apply to all involved in electrical work, from homeowners to licensed electricians.

according to this document, is an electrical license required for every person installing a solar system in Delaware and not just the electricians?  Are there plans to amend or change this?

According to the document you provided, an electrical license is required for anyone performing **electrical services or electrical work**, which includes solar electrical services such as installing, repairing, or connecting components of a solar system that generate or transmit electrical energy. Specifically, **Section 1.0** defines that performing any work covered by the National Electrical Code (NEC), including solar electrical work, requires licensure. This applies to anyone installing, erecting, or repairing solar systems involving electrical conductors, grounding, and bonding of the array.

As of the document's latest updates, there are no indications of amendments or changes that would exempt non-electricians working on solar systems from requiring a license. The requirements continue to emphasize the necessity of proper licensure for safety and compliance with the NEC.

If you are looking for specific updates or possible amendments to this regulation, it would be beneficial to regularly check with Delaware's Board of Electrical Examiners or any announcements from the Division of Professional Regulation【24†source】【17†source】.
