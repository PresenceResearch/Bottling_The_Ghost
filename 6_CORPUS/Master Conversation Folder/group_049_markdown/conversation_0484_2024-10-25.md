Creating a solar pro-forma for Maryland, particularly with varying electricity rate increase scenarios, will involve a detailed look at multiple variables such as energy rates, system production, costs, incentives, and more. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to build this pro-forma:

### 1. **Key Assumptions & Inputs:**
   - **System Size**: Based on available roof or land area and energy needs (e.g., 100 kW system for commercial or 10 kW for residential).
   - **Installation Cost**: Current average in Maryland, typically between $2.50 to $3.00 per watt for commercial systems.
   - **Incentives**:
     - **Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**: Currently at 30%.
     - **Maryland SREC Value**: Research current rates, as it has fluctuated recently. You may also want to factor in any additional grant programs.
     - **State Incentives**: Maryland Energy Administration provides various commercial and residential grants.
   - **Utility Rate**: The baseline rate from local utilities (e.g., BGE, PEPCO), typically around $0.12 to $0.14 per kWh for commercial customers.
   - **System Production**: Maryland gets roughly 1,200 to 1,400 kWh per installed kW per year, depending on shading, orientation, etc.

### 2. **Electricity Rate Increase Scenarios**:
   Choose three scenarios for electricity rate increases to model:
   - **Low**: 1% annual increase.
   - **Medium**: 3% annual increase (closer to historical average inflation of utility rates).
   - **High**: 5% annual increase.

### 3. **System Performance**:
   - **Annual System Degradation**: Solar systems typically degrade at around 0.5% to 1% per year.
   - **Annual kWh production**: For a 100 kW system, expect 120,000 – 140,000 kWh/year.

### 4. **Cost Breakdown**:
   - **Total Installation Cost**: $250,000 to $300,000 for a 100 kW system.
   - **Operations & Maintenance (O&M)**: Typically, 0.5% to 1% of the system's upfront cost annually.
   - **Financing Costs**: Factor in loan rates or lease/PPA costs if applicable.
   
### 5. **Revenue from Solar**:
   - **Savings from Utility Bill**: Calculated by the amount of electricity produced by the solar system at the prevailing utility rate, plus the rate increase over time.
   - **SREC Revenue**: The system generates 1 SREC per 1,000 kWh produced. Factor in the market rate for SRECs in Maryland.
   - **Other incentives**: Such as Maryland state grants or utility rebates.

### 6. **Pro-Forma Calculation**:
   A standard pro-forma would typically have the following structure over a 25-year period:

   **Year 0 (Upfront Costs)**:
   - System installation cost
   - Less Federal ITC (30%)
   - Less state grants and incentives (e.g., Maryland’s Commercial Solar Grant)

   **Years 1-25 (Annual Cash Flow)**:
   - **Utility Savings**: Multiply the system's annual production by the utility rate for the first year, adjusting for the increase rate (1%, 3%, or 5% annually).
   - **SREC Revenue**: Based on production and market price of SRECs.
   - **O&M Costs**: Deduct this from annual revenue (typically 1% of system cost).
   - **Loan or Lease Payments** (if applicable): Deduct any financing costs.

   **NPV (Net Present Value)**: Discount future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate (e.g., 6%-8%).

   **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**: Based on annual cash flows and the initial investment.

### 7. **Rate Increase Scenario Impacts**:
   - **Low Growth (1%)**: Project a conservative scenario where electricity prices rise minimally. This leads to lower utility bill savings over the long term, potentially making the payback period longer and the IRR lower.
   - **Medium Growth (3%)**: Historical averages often suggest a 3% rise in electricity prices, making this the most "realistic" case. Expect good savings and a typical payback period of 6-10 years, with an IRR in the 10%-15% range.
   - **High Growth (5%)**: This scenario assumes higher inflation or spikes in energy prices, resulting in faster payback and higher returns, making solar an even more attractive investment.

### 8. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   After building out the scenarios, it's wise to run sensitivity analyses on:
   - **Utility Rates**: Test how different rates impact savings and returns.
   - **SREC Prices**: Analyze how fluctuating SREC prices could affect total revenue.
   - **Financing Terms**: If loans or leases are involved, vary the interest rates or payment terms to see the impact on cash flow.

### Example Pro-Forma Table Structure:
| Year | Solar Production (kWh) | Utility Rate ($/kWh) | Annual Savings ($) | SREC Revenue ($) | O&M Costs ($) | Net Cash Flow ($) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1    | 120,000                | 0.14                 | $16,800            | $7,200           | $2,500        | $21,500          |

id also like to add something for systems that do not cover all of the usage, meaning solar will only cover a portion of the usage.  So for example solar covers 80% of the bill but the rest of the bill is covered by the utility

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:36:48*

To account for scenarios where solar only covers a portion of the electricity usage (e.g., 80% of the bill), we’ll need to adjust the pro-forma to reflect the fact that the remaining portion of energy will still be billed by the utility at the prevailing utility rate.

Here's how you can build that into the pro-forma:

### Additional Assumptions:
- **Solar Coverage Percentage**: 80% of the total electricity consumption is offset by the solar system. The remaining 20% will continue to be billed by the utility.
- **Total Energy Consumption**: Determine the total annual energy consumption (e.g., 150,000 kWh/year) before solar.
- **Utility Rate**: Use the same utility rate growth scenarios (1%, 3%, and 5%) to calculate the ongoing utility cost for the portion not covered by solar.

### Modified Calculation for Annual Savings:
For each year, your pro-forma needs to reflect:
- **Solar Offset Savings**: Solar production multiplied by the utility rate and the solar coverage percentage (in this case, 80%).
- **Utility Bill for Remaining Usage**: The remaining 20% of total consumption multiplied by the utility rate for that year.

### Step-by-Step Adjustments:

#### 1. **Energy Consumption Breakdown**:
   - **Total Consumption (before solar)**: Let's assume a business consumes 150,000 kWh per year.
   - **Solar Production**: For an 80 kW system, with an expected output of 1,200 kWh per kW annually, you would generate about 96,000 kWh per year.
   - **Solar Offset**: If solar covers 80% of the total energy usage, that means it covers 120,000 kWh of the business's total consumption (150,000 kWh x 80%).

#### 2. **Remaining Utility Usage**:
   The business will still need to purchase 30,000 kWh/year from the utility, which is 20% of the total energy consumption.

#### 3. **Utility Bill Calculation**:
   - For Year 1, if the utility rate is $0.14 per kWh, the cost for the 30,000 kWh would be $4,200.
   - Each year, you will apply the rate increase scenarios (1%, 3%, or 5%) to the portion of the bill that remains with the utility.

#### 4. **Pro-Forma Example Table**:

| Year | Solar Production (kWh) | Total Consumption (kWh) | Utility Rate ($/kWh) | Utility Bill Savings ($) | SREC Revenue ($) | Utility Bill (20% of usage) | O&M Costs ($) | Net Cash Flow ($) |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1    | 120,000                | 150,000                 | 0.14                 | $16,800                  | $7,200           | $4,200                      | $2,500        | $17,300          |
| 2    | 119,400                | 150,000                 | 0.145                | $17,313                  | $7,165           | $4,350                      | $2,525        | $17,603          |
| 3    | 118,800                | 150,000                 | 0.15                 | $17,820                  | $7,131           | $4,500                      | $2,550        | $17,901          |
| ...  | ...                    | ...                     | ...                  | ...                      | ...              | ...                         | ...           | ...              |

### Explanation of Columns:
- **Solar Production (kWh)**: How much electricity the solar system produces annually. 
- **Total Consumption (kWh)**: The total energy demand of the facility.
- **Utility Rate ($/kWh)**: The cost of electricity from the utility for the portion not covered by solar.
- **Utility Bill Savings ($)**: This represents the savings from solar offsetting 80% of the total energy usage.
- **SREC Revenue ($)**: The revenue from selling SRECs generated by the system.
- **Utility Bill (20% of usage)**: The remaining electricity consumption billed by the utility.
- **O&M Costs ($)**: The cost of maintaining the solar system.
- **Net Cash Flow ($)**: Total savings minus any costs (O&M and utility bill for the portion not covered).

### 5. **Scenario Analysis**:
   You can further analyze how this partial coverage scenario impacts different utility rate increase scenarios:
   - **Low Growth (1%)**: The utility portion will increase modestly, leading to slightly lower overall savings compared to full solar offset.
   - **Medium Growth (3%)**: A realistic middle-ground assumption, where the partial utility bill grows over time, but solar savings grow as well.
   - **High Growth (5%)**: Higher utility price increases lead to greater overall savings, even though some of the bill remains with the utility.

### 6. **Payback Period**:
   The payback period in this scenario may be slightly longer than in a full coverage scenario since the business is still paying a portion of their utility bill. However, if utility prices increase quickly, the solar portion’s savings may increase, shortening the payback period over time.

I’ve set up the solar pro-forma for Maryland with scenarios where solar covers 80% of the electricity usage and the remaining 20% is billed by the utility. The pro-forma includes three different rate increase scenarios: 1%, 3%, and 5%, showing the impact on savings, utility bills, and net cash flow over 25 years.

How does SREC pricing fluctuate?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:38:04*

SREC (Solar Renewable Energy Credit) pricing fluctuates due to several factors related to supply and demand in the specific state's renewable energy market. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors influencing SREC prices:

### 1. **Supply and Demand Imbalance**:
   - **Supply of SRECs**: The total number of SRECs generated is directly tied to the amount of solar energy produced. As more solar systems are installed, the supply of SRECs increases, which can drive prices down if demand does not increase proportionately.
   - **Demand for SRECs**: The demand for SRECs comes from utilities and energy companies that are required to meet renewable portfolio standards (RPS) set by the state. If these companies fall short of their solar energy goals, they need to buy more SRECs to avoid penalties, which can drive prices up.

### 2. **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Compliance Requirements**:
   Each state has an RPS that mandates how much of the electricity sold in the state must come from renewable sources like solar. Maryland, for instance, has an RPS with a solar carve-out that requires utilities to generate or buy a certain percentage of their energy from solar.
   - If the RPS requirements are stringent (i.e., utilities must meet high renewable energy quotas), demand for SRECs can increase, raising prices.
   - If the RPS goals are relaxed or utilities have already met their targets, demand for SRECs can drop, lowering prices.

### 3. **Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) Rates**:
   The ACP is essentially a penalty fee that utilities must pay if they cannot meet their solar energy obligations by purchasing SRECs. The ACP acts as a price ceiling for SREC prices because utilities will never pay more for an SREC than the cost of the ACP.
   - In Maryland, the ACP has decreased over time, which puts downward pressure on SREC prices. When the ACP is high, SREC prices tend to stay higher, as utilities are willing to pay more for SRECs to avoid the fine.
   - The ACP rates tend to decrease over time, as is the case in Maryland, leading to long-term price reductions in SRECs.

### 4. **Market Saturation**:
   - In a saturated market where there is an abundance of solar installations and SRECs being generated, the oversupply can cause prices to drop significantly.
   - Conversely, in markets where the solar industry is still growing and there is less solar energy generation, SREC prices may be higher due to limited supply.

### 5. **State-Specific Policy Changes**:
   - States can adjust their RPS policies, ACP rates, and solar carve-outs, which can lead to fluctuations in SREC prices. For example, if Maryland were to increase its RPS solar requirements, the demand for SRECs would rise, pushing prices up.
   - Conversely, if the state reduces the RPS requirement or introduces new incentives that increase solar installations, it could increase the supply of SRECs, lowering prices.

### 6. **Federal and State Incentives**:
   The introduction or expiration of incentives, like tax credits or grants, can impact how many new solar systems are installed, indirectly affecting the supply of SRECs and their prices.

### 7. **Market Trading and Speculation**:
   - Like other commodities, SREC prices are influenced by market trading and speculation. SRECs are typically traded in both long-term contracts and spot markets. If traders anticipate changes in supply or demand, it can lead to price volatility.
   - Uncertainty about future RPS requirements or solar adoption rates can cause speculative fluctuations in SREC prices.

### Historical Fluctuations in Maryland:
   In Maryland, SREC prices have experienced significant fluctuations:
   - A few years ago, SREC prices in Maryland were quite high (over $100 per SREC), driven by strong demand and relatively few solar systems in place.
   - As more solar installations came online, particularly after federal and state incentives boosted solar adoption, SREC prices fell sharply. In recent years, Maryland SREC prices have been in the $20-$60 range, though they can fluctuate based on supply-demand dynamics.
   - Maryland’s decreasing ACP (currently at $75 per MWh in 2023, down from $150 in previous years) has also put downward pressure on SREC prices.

### Outlook for SREC Pricing:
   - **Long-term Downward Trend**: As more solar capacity is installed and states move closer to achieving their RPS goals, SREC prices tend to decline. However, sudden policy changes or increases in renewable energy targets could lead to temporary price spikes.
   - **State Incentives and RPS Targets**: If Maryland or other states revise their RPS targets to be more aggressive, it could sustain or increase SREC prices in the future.

In conclusion, while SREC prices can vary from state to state and year to year, the general long-term trend, especially in markets like Maryland, is downward, unless there are significant changes in RPS requirements or other regulatory factors.

awesome, thank you clara.  Can you build out: 30% federal tax credit, 40% bonus depreciation, 85% depreciable basis, corpporate tax rate, current and future SREC price modeling, NPV, IRR, and ROI?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:47:58*

You're welcome, Mark! To build out a comprehensive financial model including federal tax credit, bonus depreciation, depreciable basis, corporate tax rate, SREC price modeling, and key financial metrics like NPV, IRR, and ROI, we can follow these steps:

### 1. **Federal Tax Credit (ITC)**
   - **30% Federal Tax Credit**: The system owner receives a tax credit equal to 30% of the installation cost. This is applied in the first year.
   
   **Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{ITC} = \text{Total System Cost} \times 30\%
   \]

### 2. **Bonus Depreciation**
   - **40% Bonus Depreciation**: This allows the system owner to deduct 40% of the depreciable basis of the system in the first year.
   - **85% Depreciable Basis**: Only 85% of the total system cost is depreciable after accounting for the ITC.
   
   **Depreciable Basis Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciable Basis} = \text{Total System Cost} \times 85\%
   \]
   
   **Bonus Depreciation Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{Bonus Depreciation} = \text{Depreciable Basis} \times 40\%
   \]

### 3. **Corporate Tax Rate**
   - Apply the corporate tax rate (typically 21% in the U.S.) to calculate the tax benefits from depreciation.

   **Tax Shield Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{Tax Shield from Depreciation} = \text{Depreciation} \times \text{Corporate Tax Rate}
   \]

### 4. **SREC Price Modeling**
   - Use the fluctuating SREC price data generated earlier, or project future prices with assumptions on gradual declines.
   - Include current and projected SREC prices for the first 10 years.

### 5. **NPV (Net Present Value)**
   - NPV considers all the cash inflows (energy savings, tax credits, SREC revenue, depreciation benefits) and outflows (O&M costs, loan payments) over time, discounted back to today’s value using a chosen discount rate (e.g., 6-8%).
   
   **NPV Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Net Cash Flow}_t}{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})^t}
   \]

### 6. **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**
   - IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV of the investment zero. It’s the rate of return that the solar investment generates over its lifetime.
   
   **IRR Calculation**: We will use Excel/Google Sheets' built-in **IRR** function for this.

### 7. **ROI (Return on Investment)**
   - ROI measures the overall profitability of the solar project.
   
   **ROI Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Total Net Profit}}{\text{Total Investment Cost}} \times 100\%
   \]

### Example Financial Model Structure:

| Year | ITC | Depreciable Basis | Bonus Depreciation | Tax Savings | SREC Revenue | Net Cash Flow | NPV | IRR | ROI |

Can we model alternative SREC price declines?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:48:35*

Sure! We can model alternative SREC price decline scenarios. Some common patterns to consider include:

1. **Linear Decline**: SREC prices decline at a constant rate over time.
2. **Exponential Decline**: SREC prices drop more sharply early on and then level out over time.
3. **Step Decline**: SREC prices stay relatively stable for a few years and then drop significantly at specific intervals.

### Steps to Model Different SREC Price Declines:

1. **Linear Decline**: Prices decline by a fixed amount every year.
2. **Exponential Decline**: Prices decline by a fixed percentage each year.
3. **Step Decline**: Prices stay constant for a few years, then experience a sharp drop.

### Example Assumptions for SREC Price Declines:
- **Scenario 1 (Linear Decline)**: Starts at $60/MWh, decreasing by $5 each year.
- **Scenario 2 (Exponential Decline)**: Starts at $60/MWh, decreasing by 10% each year.
- **Scenario 3 (Step Decline)**: Starts at $60/MWh for 3 years, then drops by 50% in year 4, and decreases $5 per year after that.

Let me generate the different SREC decline scenarios based on these assumptions and include them in a new model for you.

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:49:36*

The dataset you’ve provided looks quite detailed and useful for several purposes, especially for calculating and analyzing energy consumption, utility charges, and rates over time. Here’s an evaluation of its strengths and suggestions:

### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Breakdown of Utility Charges**: The dataset includes a breakdown of various utility components like supply, delivery, demand charges, fixed fees, and taxes. This allows for granular analysis of each cost component.
   
2. **Monthly Data**: The dataset spans 12 months, giving a complete annual view. This is helpful for annual cost and consumption projections, especially when calculating average rates and future trends.

3. **All-In Rate**: Having the “All-In Rate” already calculated is convenient for quickly understanding the overall cost per kWh, which is useful for evaluating savings from solar or other energy efficiency measures.

4. **Clarity of Columns**: The differentiation between supply and delivery charges is important, as solar offsets typically reduce the supply portion but not always the delivery portion.

5. **Averages and Totals**: Including monthly averages and yearly totals makes it easier to extrapolate for other periods or to perform year-over-year comparisons.

### Considerations for Improvement:
1. **Seasonal Usage Variations**: The dataset shows variations in energy usage and rates, especially during months like **July** and **August**, which likely reflects increased air conditioning use. If you’re modeling potential solar savings or future energy costs, factoring in these seasonal fluctuations is important.

2. **Extrapolation and Overrides**: There are placeholders for overriding supply and demand charges. It’s great that you can override these values, but ensuring that accurate overrides are used will be crucial for projections based on future rate changes or third-party agreements.

3. **SREC Modeling and Solar Analysis**: 
   - To use this dataset for evaluating the benefits of a solar installation, you could calculate potential savings by analyzing the portion of the utility bill solar could offset (typically supply charges, some delivery charges, and taxes).
   - It’s also useful for modeling **Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC)** revenue based on the electricity produced by the system.

4. **Future Projections**: If you're interested in making projections based on potential future increases in utility rates, you could use the historical rates and apply growth assumptions (e.g., 3-5% annual increases) to estimate future costs.

5. **Data Formatting**: Some formatting like the "orange cells" for overrides might need to be better incorporated into your workflow. It’s important to know whether those overrides are actually being used or if you plan to stick with the existing rate structure.

### Possible Uses:
- **Energy Cost Savings with Solar**: The detailed breakdown of rates per kWh (for supply, delivery, and demand) can be helpful in modeling the savings that solar might provide by offsetting these costs.
- **Rate Comparison**: If you’re evaluating different rate structures, such as a third-party energy supplier versus utility-provided energy, the dataset allows for easy comparison by adjusting the “Supply Rate Override” and recalculating the All-In Rate.
- **Budgeting and Forecasting**: You could use this dataset to budget for future energy costs or to create scenarios where rates increase or decrease, enabling more robust financial planning.

Overall, the dataset is solid for its intended purpose, but ensuring that it’s linked to future rate projections or solar savings analysis will maximize its usefulness. Would you like help setting up calculations or projections based on this data?

**You:**

*2024-10-25 19:50:01*

thats a great idea.  Can you incorporate this into the other spreadsheets we've been building?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:50:17*

Absolutely! I’ll incorporate this dataset into the existing spreadsheets we've been building. Specifically, I'll integrate the utility bill and rate information into the following areas:

1. **Annual Energy Costs**: We'll add the total utility bill and breakdown of charges from the dataset into the financial model. This will allow us to compare the cost of the existing utility bill versus potential savings from solar.

2. **SREC and Solar Savings Analysis**: I’ll link this data to our SREC price modeling, showing how much of the bill could be offset by solar production, and the impact of SREC revenue on the financial outlook.

3. **Projections**: We'll project future utility bills using rate increase scenarios and compare them with the potential savings from solar under different SREC decline models.

Let me build and integrate this into the financial model.

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:50:17*

The financial model has been updated to incorporate the utility bill data. You can download the updated file, which includes the remaining utility bill after solar offsets and solar savings, from the link below:

[Download Solar Financial Model with Utility Data CSV](sandbox:/mnt/data/solar_financial_model_with_utility.csv)

This version compares current utility costs with potential savings from solar, assuming an 80% offset of usage by the solar system. Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything further!

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:52:21*

To clean up the spreadsheet and make it more organized, I suggest the following:

1. **Simplify the Structure**:
   Group related sections (e.g., Project Costs, Depreciation, SREC, Utility Rates) and separate them clearly.

2. **Separate Data from Calculations**:
   Use one section for inputs (like project cost, tax rate, etc.) and another section for results or calculations (e.g., NPV, ROI, IRR).

3. **Use Consistent Naming**:
   Ensure all columns have consistent, easy-to-understand names.

### Example of a Cleaner Structure:

---

### **1. Inputs:**
| Description             | Value                |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **System Size (kW)**     | 270                  |
| **Project Cost ($)**     | 550,000              |
| **ITC %**                | 30%                  |
| **ITC Value ($)**        | 165,000              |
| **Depreciable Basis (%)**| 85%                  |
| **Depreciable Basis ($)**| 467,500              |
| **Bonus Depreciation**   | 40%                  |
| **Tax Rate**             | 35%                  |
| **Annual Production (kWh)**| 352,620            |
| **Annual Usage (kWh)**   | 503,063              |
| **Annual Utility Spend ($)** | 77,515           |

---

### **2. Depreciation Schedule:**
| Year | Percent Depreciated | Depreciation Amount ($) | Tax Savings ($) |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|

| 2    | 15%                 | 70,125                  | 24,543.75       |
| 3    | 15%                 | 70,125                  | 24,543.75       |
| 4    | 15%                 | 70,125                  | 24,543.75       |
| 5    | 15%                 | 70,125                  | 24,543.75       |
| **Total** | **100%**        | **467,500**             | **163,625**     |

---

### **3. SREC Projections:**
| Year | SREC Value ($/MWh) | Total SREC Revenue ($) | SREC Price Decline |
|------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 2025 | 67.50              | [Calculated]           | -8%                |

### **4. Utility Rates & Savings:**
| Year | kWh Usage (before Solar) | kWh Covered by Solar | Remaining kWh | All-In Rate ($/kWh) | Utility Cost without Solar ($) | Savings ($) |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|

This format provides clear separation of the inputs, tax benefits, SREC revenue, and utility savings, making it easier to follow and understand.

Would you like me to generate this in a spreadsheet format for you?

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:53:42*

I will create a cleaner, two-tab spreadsheet structure that includes:

1. **Input Tab**: Where all project assumptions, costs, tax impacts, and other input variables can be adjusted.
2. **Customer-Facing Tab**: A simplified and clean presentation of the project financials, including costs, savings, and cash flow, without internal references like "#REF!" errors.

Let me generate this clean version for you.

**Assistant:**

*2024-10-25 19:53:42*

The cleaned-up spreadsheet with two tabs—one for input and one for customer-facing results—is ready. You can download it from the link below:

[Download Clean Solar Project Spreadsheet](sandbox:/mnt/data/solar_project_clean.xlsx)

This version should be easier to follow and present to customers, without the internal calculation errors or unnecessary complexity. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
