It looks like you're trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that requires some additional security settings, like a server CA certificate and specific identity options. Here’s a breakdown to help you connect:

1. **Server CA Certificate**: This is often a certificate to verify the network’s identity. If it’s set to "Default," leave it as is unless your network administrator has provided a specific certificate to install.

2. **Subject Match & Subject Alternative Name Match**: These settings ensure that the network’s certificate matches specific criteria. You can usually leave these blank unless instructed otherwise.

3. **Domain Suffix Match**: This is also related to certificate matching. If you don’t have a specific domain suffix, you can skip this.

4. **Identity**: This is typically your **username** for the network. Enter your username here.

5. **Password**: This is where you enter your **password** for the network.

Try filling in just the **Identity** (your username) and **Password** fields and leave the rest as default or blank. If the network still doesn’t connect, you may need additional settings from your IT administrator, such as specific certificate files or domain suffixes.

The message you're seeing, “Missing 'Subject alternative name match' or 'Domain suffix match' to validate the authentication server identity,” indicates that the Wi-Fi network is configured to require additional validation for security. Here’s what you can try:

1. **Domain Suffix Match**: You may need to enter a specific domain suffix, like “company.com” or “school.edu,” depending on the network. If you’re connecting at work or school, check with IT for this information.

2. **Subject Alternative Name Match**: This field is sometimes used to validate the server name. It would also need a specific domain or server name, which IT could provide.

3. **Try Leaving the Fields Blank or as Default**: If you don't have access to the specific information, try leaving both “Subject alternative name match” and “Domain suffix match” blank or set to "Default" (if available) and attempt to connect again.

4. **Ask IT Support**: For some enterprise networks, these settings are mandatory, and you’ll need precise details from the network administrator to connect.

Give this a shot, and if it still doesn’t connect, it’s likely you’ll need IT’s input for the exact domain suffix or server name.

Yes, some of this information can help in understanding the network settings. Here’s what might be useful and how to apply it on your other device:

1. **IP Address and Subnet Mask**: The IP address (`10.3.2.17`) and subnet mask (`255.255.252.0`) are assigned dynamically by the network, so you usually don’t need to input them manually unless you’re setting a static IP.

2. **Router IP**: The router IP (`10.3.0.1`) is the gateway address for this network. It might not be directly useful unless you need to input specific details for advanced settings.

3. **DNS**: DNS is set to automatic here, which means the network is handling it without requiring manual configuration.

For networks like these, your login (identity and password) is generally sufficient. If your device is still asking for additional details like a "Domain suffix match" or "Subject alternative name match," it may still be necessary to consult IT support for those fields.

If the network on your other device allows you to leave the more advanced fields (like domain suffix) blank or default, try that first. Let me know if this works or if you see any additional error messages.

No for the error message

**Assistant:**

For the **"Missing 'Subject alternative name match' or 'Domain suffix match' to validate the authentication server identity"** error, the "Subject alternative name match" and "Domain suffix match" fields are additional security requirements that validate the server’s identity.

Here’s what you can try to resolve this:

1. **Subject Alternative Name Match**: This field often requires a specific server name or domain associated with the network. For Berklee, it could be something like `*.berklee.edu` or similar, depending on how they’ve set up their Wi-Fi security. You might need to check with Berklee’s IT support to confirm this exact value.

2. **Domain Suffix Match**: If you don’t have the exact information for "Subject alternative name match," try inputting a general domain like `berklee.edu` in this field, as this might satisfy the requirement.

3. **Check with IT Support**: Berklee’s IT support would have the exact details, as enterprise Wi-Fi networks often require these settings for secure connections. They should be able to provide the precise entries needed for both "Subject alternative name match" and "Domain suffix match."

If neither of these fields can be left blank and you don't have the values, contacting IT is your best bet.
