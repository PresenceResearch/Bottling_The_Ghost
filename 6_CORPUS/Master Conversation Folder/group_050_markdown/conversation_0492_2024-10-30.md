The dataset appears to be loaded, but I don’t see a column directly labeled "size of building." Could you clarify which column represents the building size or any additional details to help locate it? If there’s an abbreviation or alternate label, that would also be helpful.

Certainly! Which specific certification type(s) would you like to filter by? Some examples from this dataset include "MBE," "DBE," "SBE," or other certification markers. Let me know the type(s) you're interested in, and I'll apply the filter accordingly.
