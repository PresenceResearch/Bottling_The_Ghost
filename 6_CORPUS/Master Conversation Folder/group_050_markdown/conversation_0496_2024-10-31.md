Yes, the Sonos Playbar is compatible with the Sonos One (and its predecessor, the Play:1). You can pair two Sonos Ones with the Playbar to create a surround sound system, enhancing the audio experience by adding dedicated rear channels. 

For setup, you’ll need to use the Sonos app, which will guide you through pairing the Playbar with the Sonos One speakers, allowing them to work seamlessly together.
