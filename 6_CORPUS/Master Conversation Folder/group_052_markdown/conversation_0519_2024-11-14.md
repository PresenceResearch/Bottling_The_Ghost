[Intro]  
Out in Woodridge, they play and run,  
Two sisters shining in the sun,  
Holly and Emmy, as close as can be,  
Sharing smiles and laughter so free.  

[Verse 1]  
Holly, so jolly, her laugh like a song,  
Emmy so dreamy, she goes right along,  
With brother Joey, their guide, strong and true,  
Every day’s special with this family crew.  

[Chorus]  
Holly and Emmy, two hearts so bright,  
Hand in hand from morning to night,  
With Mommy and Daddy, so proud and so near,  
And Grandma Carol and Grandpa Russ here.  

[Verse 2]  
When Holly feels folly, she’ll skip down the street,  
Emmy beside her, with steps soft and sweet,  
They play in the garden, and laugh till they’re red,  
With dreams of adventure filling their heads.  

[Chorus]  
Holly and Emmy, two hearts so bright,  
Hand in hand from morning to night,  
With Mommy and Daddy, so proud and so near,  
And Grandma Carol and Grandpa Russ here.  

[Bridge]  
Through sunny and cloudy, these two always stand,  
Together forever, just hand in hand,  
With rhymes for Emmy and Holly they sing,  
In Woodridge, their laughter makes everything ring.  

[Verse 3]  
And Joey the leader, so steady and strong,  
Guides them both gently as they skip along,  
With Grandma and Grandpa to cheer every day,  
Their family love guides them each step of the way.  

[Chorus]  
Holly and Emmy, two hearts so bright,  
Hand in hand from morning to night,  
With Mommy and Daddy, so proud and so near,  
And Grandma Carol and Grandpa Russ here.  

[Outro]  
So here’s to the Hoopers, with joy they’ll grow,  
Through all life’s seasons, together they’ll go,  
Holly and Emmy, forever they’ll play,  
In Woodridge, Illinois, come what may.
