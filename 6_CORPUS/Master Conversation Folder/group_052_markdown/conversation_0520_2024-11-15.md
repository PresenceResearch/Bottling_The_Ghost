My first option is a market rate of 7.5% amortized over 20 years.  my second option is a 15 year loan at 4.99%, 30% special payment in month 18, and a dealer fee of 19.5%.  This makes my monthly payment $7,139.  my third option is a 20 year loan at 4.99% with a 30% special payment in month 18 and a 21.5% dealer fee, this makes my monthly payment $6,100.

To evaluate which loan option is best for your $1,000,000 commercial solar project, we need to assess the total cost of each option over its term, including the impact of the dealer fees and the 30% federal tax credit. Here's a detailed breakdown of the factors to consider:

### **Option 1: Market Rate Loan**
- **Loan Amount:** $1,000,000
- **Interest Rate:** 7.5%
- **Amortization Period:** 20 years
- **Monthly Payment:** Approximately $8,060
- **Federal Tax Credit:** $300,000 (30% of $1,000,000)
- **Closing Costs:** Assumed standard but not specified.

### **Option 2: 15-Year Loan with 4.99% Interest**
- **Loan Amount:** $1,195,000 (includes 19.5% dealer fee)
- **Interest Rate:** 4.99%
- **Amortization Period:** 15 years
- **Monthly Payment:** $7,139
- **Special Payment in Month 18:** 30% of $1,195,000 = $358,500
- **Federal Tax Credit:** $358,500 (30% of $1,195,000)

### **Option 3: 20-Year Loan with 4.99% Interest**
- **Loan Amount:** $1,215,000 (includes 21.5% dealer fee)
- **Interest Rate:** 4.99%
- **Amortization Period:** 20 years
- **Monthly Payment:** $6,100
- **Special Payment in Month 18:** 30% of $1,215,000 = $364,500
- **Federal Tax Credit:** $364,500 (30% of $1,215,000)

### Key Considerations for Decision:
1. **Total Interest Paid:** Lower interest rates mean you pay less in interest over time, but dealer fees can offset this benefit.
2. **Federal Tax Credit Impact:** Dealer fees increase the loan amount and the tax credit amount, which partially offsets the higher loan costs.
3. **Dealer Fees:** High dealer fees can add significant upfront costs to the loan.
4. **Monthly Payment Affordability:** A lower monthly payment might be attractive for cash flow management.
5. **Total Cost Over the Loan Term:** This is the primary determinant of which option is most cost-effective.
