Write a song about the camp fun shine Saturday schedule for campers Carol and Russ. The first activity is breakfast. Breakfast is oatmeal with lots of weird things that Russ puts on it. The second activity is a field trip and a shopping trip. Campers will go to the Dutch market, Talbots, Baltimore, tea, and coffee, and Jeppi nuts. Campers will then have quiet time until dinner. After dinner campers will go to the big city to see the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra right about how the campers will have so much fun and drink lots of tea and decaffeinated coffee.

**Lyrics:**  

[Intro]  
It’s a Saturday sunrise, the day’s just begun,  
Carol and Russ are ready for some fun.  
The oatmeal’s steaming, with toppings galore,  
Weird and wonderful, who could ask for more?  

[Verse 1]  
Breakfast starts the day, with a creative flair,  
Russ grabs the raisins, peanut butter’s there.  
A sprinkle of cinnamon, maybe some spice,  
Oatmeal’s an adventure, oh, it tastes so nice!  

[Chorus]  
Oh, Camp Fun Shine, we’re laughing and free,  
Exploring the world with Carol and Russ, you’ll see.  
From the Dutch market to coffee and tea,  
Saturday’s a treasure, a memory to be.  

[Verse 2]  
The field trip’s on, and the bus is packed,  
To Talbots we’re heading, we’re right on track.  
Dutch Market treasures and Jeppi nuts to munch,  
Baltimore’s calling; let’s grab some lunch!  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tea’s brewing warm, coffee’s decaf delight,  
Quiet time’s waiting, till the evening’s light.  

[Chorus]  
Oh, Camp Fun Shine, we’re laughing and free,  
Exploring the world with Carol and Russ, you’ll see.  
From the Dutch market to coffee and tea,  
Saturday’s a treasure, a memory to be.  

[Bridge]  
As the sun dips low, and dinner’s been shared,  
The city’s alive; we’re all prepared.  
The Symphony Orchestra plays a grand tune,  
Under Baltimore’s stars, we’ll dance with the moon.  

[Outro]  
Camp Fun Shine magic, a day to adore,  
Carol and Russ, they’re asking for more.  
With tea in our hands and hearts full of cheer,  
Saturday at Camp Fun Shine, the best of the year.  

[End]  
Quiet moments, melodies high,  
Camp Fun Shine forever, under the sky.
