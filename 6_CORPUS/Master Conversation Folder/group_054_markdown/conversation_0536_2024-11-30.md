**Style, Genre and Type:** Playful, Children's Song  

**Lyrics:**  

[Intro]  
Bennett’s got a love that’s big and true,  
For dinosaurs, old and new!  

[Verse 1]  
Bennett loves Tyrannosaurus rex,  
Stomping through the land, what’s next?  
Bennett loves Triceratops too,  
With its three horns, it’s coming through!  

[Chorus]  
Dinosaurs, big and small,  
Bennett loves them all!  
From the ground to the sky,  
Bennett’s love will never die!  

[Verse 2]  
Bennett loves Velociraptor’s speed,  
Quick on its feet, it’s what he needs.  
Bennett loves Brachiosaurus tall,  
Reaching leaves, above them all.  

[Chorus]  
Dinosaurs, big and small,  
Bennett loves them all!  
From the ground to the sky,  
Bennett’s love will never die!  

[Bridge]  
Stegosaurus plates shining bright,  
Ankylosaurus, ready to fight.  
Spinosaurus with its mighty sail,  
Allosaurus, fierce on the trail.  

[Verse 3]  
Diplodocus swings its tail so long,  
Iguanodon hums a peaceful song.  
Parasaurolophus calls so clear,  
Pachycephalosaurus is always near.  

[Chorus]  
Dinosaurs, big and small,  
Bennett loves them all!  
From the ground to the sky,  
Bennett’s love will never die!  

[Bridge 2]  
Carnotaurus with its tiny arms,  
Ceratosaurus shows off its charms.  
Gallimimus runs in a racing spree,  
Compsognathus is as small as can be.  

[Verse 4]  
Maiasaura cares for its young,  
Therizinosaurus, its claws are long.  
Giganotosaurus, so grand and wide,  
Microraptor soars like it’s ready to glide.  

[Outro]  
Bennett’s love for dinos will always grow,  
Through ancient lands and fossils below.  
Dinosaurs, big and small,  
Bennett will always love them all!  

[End]
