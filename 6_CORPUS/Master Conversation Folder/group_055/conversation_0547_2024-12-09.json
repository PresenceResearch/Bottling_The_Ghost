            "**Speech: Empowering Communities with Renewable Energy**  \n\nGood [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone,  \n\nIt is an honor to stand before you today to discuss how the renewable energy revolution\u2014powered by solar\u2014is not just transforming the way we generate electricity, but also advancing the critical values of **diversity, equity, and inclusion**. We are building a future where clean energy is accessible to everyone, and that future is intersectional, equitable, and just.  \n\nFor too long, the benefits of clean energy have been out of reach for **historically marginalized communities**, including **Black, Indigenous, LatinX, and People of Color (BIPOC)**, as well as **LGBTQIA+ individuals** and those across the spectrum of **gender identity**\u2014from **genderqueer** to **non-binary** to **genderfluid**. But today, we\u2019re changing that narrative. Solar energy is breaking barriers, dismantling systems of exclusion, and creating **new pathways for prosperity** that leave no one behind.  \n\n### **Breaking Down Systemic Barriers**  \n\nSolar energy has the power to address the **environmental justice** issues that disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. These communities have often been left to bear the brunt of environmental harm, from pollution to climate change, while being excluded from the economic benefits of clean energy innovation.  \n- Through **low-to-moderate income (LMI) solar programs**, we\u2019re democratizing access to renewable energy, ensuring that **solar affordability** is no longer a privilege but a right.  \n- Policies like **inclusive net metering** and **community solar projects** are paving the way for equitable participation in the energy transition. These programs prioritize **frontline communities**, providing them with lower energy bills, cleaner air, and local economic opportunities.  \n\n### **A Commitment to Diversity in the Solar Workforce**  \n\nThe solar industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the economy, and we are dedicated to ensuring that this growth reflects the **diversity of the communities we serve**.  \n- Initiatives like **DEI hiring pipelines**, **training programs**, and partnerships with **historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs)**, **Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs)**, and **tribal colleges** are bringing more BIPOC individuals into the renewable energy workforce.  \n- LGBTQIA+ representation in solar is increasing through alliances with organizations like the **National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)**, ensuring that solar careers are welcoming and inclusive for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  \n\n### **Economic Empowerment through Clean Energy**  \n\nSolar is creating **economic empowerment** in communities where it is most needed.  \n- Families in under-resourced neighborhoods are saving on their utility bills, thanks to **federally funded programs** like the **Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean energy tax credits**, which prioritize LMI households.  \n- **Community solar gardens** allow renters and those without rooftop access to own a share in the solar economy, giving them **a stake in their energy future**.  \n- **Solar apprenticeships** and job creation in **construction, project management, and sales** are providing sustainable career opportunities for women, BIPOC individuals, and those with non-traditional educational backgrounds.  \n\n### **Intersectional Climate Solutions**  \n\nThe fight for renewable energy intersects with the broader fight for **social justice**. Solar is not just about reducing carbon emissions; it is about addressing the systemic inequities that have shaped our energy system for centuries.  \n- **Resilience hubs powered by solar microgrids** are being built in neighborhoods most vulnerable to extreme weather events, ensuring that no one is left behind in times of crisis.  \n- **Inclusive energy planning** ensures that policies are co-created with input from **LGBTQIA+ organizations**, **advocates for disabled individuals**, and **grassroots leaders** in the communities most affected by climate change.  \n\n### **A Call to Action**  \n\nToday, we have the opportunity to make clean energy truly transformative. By centering **diverse voices** and prioritizing equity, we can ensure that the solar industry leads with **justice, inclusion, and representation**. To my friends in the audience\u2014whether you are a solar developer, policymaker, activist, or ally\u2014your work has never been more critical.  \n\nTogether, let\u2019s commit to an energy future where:  \n- **Every rooftop, regardless of zip code, has the potential to host solar panels.**  \n- **Every community, from rural towns to urban centers, feels the benefits of lower energy costs and clean air.**  \n- **Every identity and lived experience is celebrated, valued, and empowered in this transformative industry.**  \n\nSolar is not just about kilowatts; it\u2019s about **kicking down walls**. It\u2019s about lifting communities, creating opportunities, and ensuring a just transition to a brighter, more inclusive tomorrow.  \n\nThank you. Let\u2019s light the way together.  "

            "Solar energy is not just revolutionizing how we power our homes and businesses\u2014it\u2019s also becoming a powerful driver of equity and inclusion for every individual, regardless of identity. As we build a renewable energy future, we are intentionally centering the voices and needs of **LGBTQIA+ communities**\u2014including **lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and aromantic individuals**, as well as those who are **genderqueer, non-binary, genderfluid, and two-spirit**. Solar is for everyone, and we are ensuring that no one is left behind in this clean energy transformation.  \n\nFor too long, LGBTQIA+ individuals, particularly those in **intersectional identities**, have faced systemic barriers to economic opportunity and environmental justice. The solar industry is working to break those barriers by offering inclusive policies, workforce training, and community solar programs that uplift marginalized groups. Partnerships with organizations like the **National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)** and the creation of LGBTQIA+-centered renewable energy coalitions are fostering access to solar careers, leadership positions, and economic empowerment in historically excluded communities.  \n\nSolar is also making a difference in the everyday lives of LGBTQIA+ individuals by lowering energy costs for vulnerable households, supporting **LGBTQIA+-led nonprofits** with solar installations, and building **resilience hubs** in queer-affirming community spaces. These efforts ensure that the benefits of solar\u2014clean air, economic savings, and energy security\u2014are available to those who need them most, especially in communities disproportionately affected by climate change and economic inequities.  \n\nThe renewable energy future is one where every identity is respected, uplifted, and included. Solar is more than a clean energy source\u2014it is a vehicle for justice, opportunity, and inclusion for all members of the **LGBTQIA+ spectrum**. Together, we are building a brighter, more inclusive world for everyone under the sun."
