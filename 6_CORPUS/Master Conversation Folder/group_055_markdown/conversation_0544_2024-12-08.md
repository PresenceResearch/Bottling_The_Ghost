**Title:** Warm My Wiener  

**Style of Music:** [Country, honky-tonk, male voice, upbeat and playful]  

**Lyrics:**  

[Intro, Acoustic guitar, Steel guitar twang]  
(Spoken)  
"Now listen here, y’all... It’s a cold, cold night, and I’ve got one request..."  

[Verse 1, Playful tone, Male voice]  
Well, the fire’s burnin’ low, and the wind’s blowin’ strong,  
This chill in my bones won’t let me last long.  
I got a little somethin’ that needs some heat,  
So grab that skillet, darlin’, and make my night complete.  

[Chorus, Upbeat, Steel guitar melody]  
Warm my wiener, baby, don’t let it freeze,  
Keep it toasty, keep it cozy, I’m beggin’ you, please.  
It’s too cold to handle, so light up the flame,  
Warm my wiener, darlin’, make it never the same!  

[Instrumental Break, Harmonica and Steel Guitar Solo]  

[Verse 2, Humorous tone, Male voice]  
I’ve been out workin’ hard in the frost and the snow,  
My hands are frozen, and my feet are slow.  
But the one thing I need to thaw me out,  
Is your magic touch, darlin’, without a doubt.  

[Chorus, Playful delivery, Backing vocals]  
Warm my wiener, baby, don’t let it freeze,  
Keep it toasty, keep it cozy, I’m beggin’ you, please.  
It’s too cold to handle, so light up the flame,  
Warm my wiener, darlin’, make it never the same!  

[Bridge, Slower, Emotional build-up]  
You know it’s more than a snack, it’s a love so true,  
When you’re grillin’ and thrillin’, I’m stuck on you.  
So fan those embers, let the fire burn bright,  
And warm my wiener all through the night.  

[Final Chorus, Big and Bold, Steel guitar, Fiddle accompaniment]  
Warm my wiener, baby, don’t let it freeze,  
Keep it toasty, keep it cozy, I’m beggin’ you, please.  
It’s too cold to handle, so light up the flame,  
Warm my wiener, darlin’, make it never the same!  

[Outro, Acoustic strum, Harmonica fade-out]  
(Spoken with a laugh)  
"Now that’s the kind of love I’m talkin’ about..."

Please structure this as a modern Broadway finale: [Intro][female narrator]
This is a story about a girl.

Not just any girl.

The most badass girl in the whole wide world.

That’s right, baby.

You know who I’m talking about!

[Verse 1][female vocal]
She grew up in Massapequa.
(GO CHIEFS!),
On 24 West Shore Drive.
Poofy hair, dangly earrings, and lipstick.
Depeche Mode kept her alive.
(Black celebrations with the Unicorn didn’t hurt either)

[Verse 2]
She went to Boston College.
(GO. EAGLES!).
Worked hard every day.
Fell in love with all the wrong guys.
They were both probably gay.

[Chorus]
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh.
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind.
She’s my favorite, my best friend, my other half.
She makes a mess, but I don’t mind.

[Break][Male Narrator]
OK…maybe a little (but I still love you)

[Verse 3]
She went to college, two more times. (Aaaahhh)
Went to Boston.  Went to work. (Oooh wah oooh)
Dated a few stupid loser guys. (Oooo, oooo)
Trumpet players are real jerks

[Bridge]
She worked so hard, giving it her all (oooh).
Moved to New York City, heeded its call (ooh waah ooooh).
Before long, what do you know (aaaah)
She is playing in a Broadway Show!
[Belting]
Broadway shooooooowwwww!

[Spoken Interlude][reporter]
The Woman in White.
South Pacific.
Little Women.
Amazing Grace.
Evita.
[key change][dramatic build up]
The Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder.
Honeymoon in Vegas.
Anastasia.
Mary Poppins.
The Music Man.
[Pause for effect]
FROZEN FROZEN FROZEN YAAAYYYY!!!

[Break][female narrator]
Oh my God I love Frozen so much, what the FUCK is wrong with you?

[Chorus]
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh,
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind.
She’s my favorite, my best friend, my other half,
She makes a mess, but I don’t mind.

[Verse 4]
After The Music Man was over
it was time to go (to goooo)
It was fuck this shit o’clock
she didn’t want another show (fuck this shiiiit)
So now she’s teaching,
And doing really great
All the boys and girls
Call her PROFESSOR ABATE!

[Percussion break]

[Verse 5]
Cookie calls her “Not Dad,” but that’s ok.
Because she loves her anyway (woof woof woof woof!).
She’s stylish, beautiful, short, and loud.
With long hair flowing, standing proud.

[Pre-Chorus][key change]
Standing proooouuud!

[Chorus]
She’s fun and pretty and makes me laugh.
Her spirit’s wild, but her heart is kind.
She’s my favorite, my best friend, my other half.
She makes a mess, but I don’t mind.

[Outro]
She’s my Space Jam partner.
She’s my girl
She’s my bestest buddy in the whole wide world.
She makes me happy when I’m sad.
Stomps her feet when she gets mad
She sings me songs, tells me jokes and tells me stories.
She snores like a baby gorilla.
She has a lot of cool shoes.
She has enormous jugs and a big butt.
[pause]
And she’s my wife.
[pause]
YAAAY!
[cheers and applause]

**Assistant:**

**Title:** She’s My Wife  

**Style of Music:** [Phantom of the Opera, dramatic operatic ballad, orchestral swells, haunting organ motifs, dynamic vocal interplay, intense crescendos]  

**Lyrics:**  

[Intro, Female Narrator, Haunting Organ, Ethereal Strings]  
(This is a story about a girl.  
Not just any girl.  
The most badass girl in the whole wide world.  
That’s right, baby.  
You know who I’m talking about!)  

[Verse 1, Female Solo, Brooding, Echoing Vocals]  
She grew up in Massapequa,  
Where shadows danced by the shore.  
Poofy hair and ruby lipstick,  
Dreaming always of something more.  
(Whispered ensemble echoes)  
**“Something more...”**  

[Verse 2, Male Voice, Rich Baritone, Tension Builds]  
She studied at Boston College,  
Where towers rise in twilight’s haze.  
She gave her heart to fleeting lovers,  
But they were lost in their own maze.  
(Ensemble whispers)  
**“In their maze...”**  

[Chorus, Duet, Grand Crescendo, Organ and Choir]  
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh,  
Her spirit burns with fire untamed.  
She’s my favorite, my eternal half,  
A wild force that cannot be named!  

[Break, Male Narrator, Deep and Intense, Organ Underlay]  
(Spoken)  
But even chaos has its beauty…  
And I would follow her anywhere.  

[Verse 3, Female Voice, Higher Key, Desperate Emotion]  
She moved through darkened Boston streets,  
A lone flame in a frozen storm.  
Dated fools with hollow music,  
Their notes rang false, their hearts not warm.  
(Ensemble harmonizes)  
**“Not warm...”**  

[Bridge, Duet, Surging with Passion, Full Orchestra]  
She worked so hard, her soul ablaze,  
The city’s song called her away.  
A beacon rose: the Broadway stage!  
Her destiny, her grand ballet!  

[Female Vocal, Belting in a Soaring Climax]  
Broadway shooooooowwwww!  

[Spoken Interlude, Male Narrator, Choir Swells Behind]  
(She took her place in the pantheon…)  
**The Woman in White!  
South Pacific!  
Little Women!  
Amazing Grace!  
Evita!**  

[Key Change, Full Ensemble, Orchestral Swell]  
**The Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder!  
Honeymoon in Vegas!  
Anastasia!  
Mary Poppins!  
The Music Man!**  

[Pause for Effect, Whispered Ensemble Echoes]  
**“Frozen…Frozen…Frozen…”**  

[Break, Female Voice, Dramatic and Anguished]  
OH MY GOD, I LOVE FROZEN SO MUCH—  
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!  

[Chorus, Duet, Choir Echoes, Strings Soaring]  
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh,  
Her spirit burns with fire untamed.  
She’s my favorite, my eternal half,  
A wild force that cannot be named!  

[Verse 4, Female Solo, Solemn and Reflective]  
When *The Music Man* was over,  
The curtain fell, the stage went dark.  
Her restless soul sought higher meaning,  
A guiding light, a kindled spark.  

[Percussion Break, Dramatic, Choral Whispers]  

[Verse 5, Male Solo, Passionate and Reverent]  
The students call her “Not Dad,” it’s true,  
Yet love her all the same.  
A voice of strength, a force of nature,  
They sing her timeless name!  

[Pre-Chorus, Ensemble, Dramatic Key Change, Rising Energy]  
**“Abate! Abate!”**  
Her name will echo through the ages!  

[Chorus, Full Ensemble, Thunderous Organ and Strings]  
She’s fun and pretty, makes me laugh,  
Her spirit burns with fire untamed.  
She’s my favorite, my eternal half,  
A wild force that cannot be named!  

[Outro, Spoken, Quietly Reverent, Single Note on the Organ]  
(She’s my Space Jam partner.  
She’s my girl.  
She’s my bestest buddy in the whole wide world.  
She makes me happy when I’m sad.  
Stomps her feet when she gets mad.  
She sings me songs, tells me jokes, and tells me stories.  
She snores like a baby gorilla.  
She has a lot of cool shoes.  
She has enormous jugs and a big butt.)  

[Pause, Choir Sings Softly]  
And she’s my wife.  

[Finale, Full Ensemble, Majestic Chord and Applause]  
**YAAAY!**  

[END]
