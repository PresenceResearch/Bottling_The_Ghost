   - The app will guide you through the pairing process, including connecting to your Wi-Fi network.

7. **Adjust Settings**  
   - Name your Sonos Five (e.g., "Living Room") and set up any additional preferences.
   - If you have two Sonos Fives and want to set them up as a stereo pair, go to **Settings** > **System** > Select your Sonos Five > **Create Stereo Pair**, and follow the prompts.

8. **Enjoy Your Music**  
   Once paired, you can stream music from your favorite services or directly from your device.
