Yes, you can use a separate Verizon router as a Wi-Fi extender, but it may require some configuration. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting it up:

---

### **1. Check Compatibility**
Ensure the router you want to use as an extender is compatible with your primary Verizon router. Most modern routers can function as extenders, but you may need to adjust some settings.

---

### **2. Decide on Connection Type**
You can connect the secondary router to the primary one either:
- **Wired** (Ethernet): This will provide better speed and reliability.
- **Wireless**: This is more flexible but may reduce overall network performance.

---

### **3. Configure the Secondary Router**
To use the second router as an extender:
1. **Access the Secondary Router’s Settings**:
   - Connect to the secondary router (via Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
   - Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) in the address bar.
   - Log in using the router's admin credentials (found on the router or in its manual).

2. **Change the Router’s IP Address**:
   - Set the secondary router’s IP to be in the same range as the primary router but outside its DHCP pool. For example, if your primary router is `192.168.1.1`, you might set the secondary router to `192.168.1.2`.

3. **Disable DHCP on the Secondary Router**:
   - This prevents the secondary router from assigning IP addresses, which is the primary router's job.

4. **Set Up Wireless Repeating (if using wireless)**:
   - Look for a feature like “Wireless Repeater,” “Bridge Mode,” or “Access Point” in the settings.
   - Enter the primary router’s SSID and password to connect them.

5. **Set the Same SSID and Password (Optional)**:
   - For seamless roaming, use the same SSID (network name) and password on both routers.
   - If you prefer to manage which router you connect to, use different SSIDs.

### **4. Position the Secondary Router**
- Place the secondary router in an area with good signal from the primary router if you're using a wireless connection.
- If using a wired connection, position it where you want to extend the coverage.

---

### **5. Test the Connection**
- Move around your home to ensure the Wi-Fi signal is stronger in previously weak areas.
- Use a speed test app to verify the network performance.

---

### **6. Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure the secondary router supports bridge or repeater modes.
- If wireless performance is poor, consider using a wired backhaul with Ethernet.
- Update the firmware on both routers to the latest version for compatibility.
