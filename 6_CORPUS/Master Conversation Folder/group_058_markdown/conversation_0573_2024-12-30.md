how can I use you as a to-do, project management tool?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 10:46:44*

While I’m not a dedicated project management tool, I can still help you manage tasks, projects, and deadlines in the following ways:

### 1. **Task Creation and Organization**
   - I can help you create and categorize to-do lists.
   - Assign priorities to tasks.
   - Break larger projects into smaller, actionable steps.

### 2. **Reminders**
   - Set up reminders for important deadlines or meetings (though I won’t send you notifications directly—you can copy tasks to your phone’s reminders or calendar).

### 3. **Tracking Progress**
   - Update me on the status of tasks, and I’ll help you keep track of what's done and what’s pending.

### 4. **Project Planning**
   - I can assist in outlining project timelines, including milestones and dependencies.
   - Suggest strategies to stay organized and focused.

### 5. **Accountability**
   - Let me know your goals, and I can check in with you to see how things are progressing.

### 6. **Integration with Other Tools**
   - If you’re using ClickUp or another app, I can guide you on how to set it up or provide task templates for those tools.

### 7. **Templates for Task Management**
   - I can create reusable templates for recurring tasks or projects.

### Example Workflow
1. **Define a Project:**  
   "I need to manage my commercial solar sales pipeline. Let’s set milestones."
   - I’ll help you define each stage and what’s required.

2. **Daily To-Dos:**  
   "What do I need to do today to hit my goals?"
   - I’ll list your tasks, organize by priority, and suggest next steps.

3. **Check-In:**  
   "Here’s what I did. What’s next?"
   - Update me, and I’ll adjust your tasks or priorities.

4. **Review:**  
   At the end of the week, we can recap what you’ve accomplished and plan for the next.

If this approach resonates, let me know what kind of tasks or projects you’d like to track, and I can help you get started!

**Assistant:**

You can use me as a to-do and project management tool in a few different ways to stay organized and focused. Here's how we can break it down:

### 1. **Task Management**
   - **Create Tasks:** Simply tell me what tasks you need to complete, and I can help you organize them into a list. You can assign priorities, deadlines, and categories to tasks.
   - **Track Progress:** You can check in with me about the status of tasks, and I can help you keep track of what’s done and what’s still pending.
   - **Reminder System:** I can remind you of upcoming deadlines or tasks that need to be done by a certain time. You can ask for check-ins at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, daily).
   
### 2. **Project Planning**
   - **Break Projects into Steps:** If you’re working on a larger project, I can help you break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks and milestones. 
   - **Timeline Creation:** I can help you plan your project timeline by suggesting timeframes for tasks, setting deadlines, and tracking your progress.
   - **Prioritization:** I can help you prioritize tasks based on urgency or importance, so you can focus on the most critical things first.

### 3. **Documenting and Organizing Information**
   - **Notes & Ideas:** If you have thoughts, ideas, or need to gather information, you can use me to store and organize those details in an easily accessible format.
   - **File Management:** Although I can’t store files directly, I can help you figure out where to organize them on your devices or cloud services.

### 4. **Goal Setting & Tracking**
   - **Set Long-Term and Short-Term Goals:** Share your goals with me, and I can break them down into actionable steps to keep you on track.
   - **Review Progress:** You can periodically check in on how you're progressing toward your goals, and I can help identify any roadblocks or changes you might need to make.

### 5. **Integration with Other Tools**
   - While I can’t interact with external apps directly, I can suggest ways you can integrate me with your existing tools, such as providing summaries, creating tasks you can copy into apps like ClickUp or Todoist, or giving you insights into your CRM.

If you want to create a specific system or have tasks in mind, let me know, and I can help tailor a project plan to your needs!

**You:**

*2024-12-30 10:48:13*

I need help setting up Marvin because it's so complicated.  Plus I have to use Jira at work and I hate it.  Are there some kind of integrations between Jira and Marvin>

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 10:48:38*

Mark needs help setting up Amazing Marvin and finds it complicated. He uses Jira at work and dislikes it.

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 10:48:38*

Setting up Amazing Marvin can feel overwhelming because of its customizability, but once it's tailored to your needs, it’s super effective. Let's tackle this step by step:

### Simplifying Amazing Marvin Setup
1. **Define Your Workflow:**
   - What’s your primary goal? (e.g., task management, habit tracking, project tracking, etc.)
   - Do you prefer a simple to-do list or a system with categories, due dates, and priorities?
   
2. **Start Small:**
   - Use a basic setup first, like:
     - **Daily List**: Focus on today’s tasks.
     - **Master List**: Dump all tasks and categorize later.
     - **Calendar View**: For time-blocking if you prefer visual schedules.

3. **Add Strategies Gradually:**
   - Activate one or two productivity strategies like:
     - **Time Blocking**: Schedule blocks for focused work.
     - **Weekly Review**: A place to reflect and adjust.
   - Amazing Marvin lets you toggle strategies on/off, so experiment.

4. **Organize with Tags or Folders:**
   - Use tags like “Work,” “Personal,” or “High Priority” to keep tasks organized without overcomplicating.

5. **Set Defaults for Simplicity:**
   - Set default due dates, categories, or priorities to avoid repetitive manual input.

### Integrating Jira with Amazing Marvin
Amazing Marvin doesn’t have built-in Jira integration, but here are some workarounds:

1. **Manual Sync with Copy-Paste:**
   - Export tasks from Jira as a CSV file.
   - Import them into Marvin or copy key tasks manually to keep your personal view uncluttered.

2. **Use Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat):**
   - Create a Zap (automation) that triggers updates from Jira into Marvin or vice versa. 
   - For example, when a Jira task is assigned to you, it can automatically appear in Marvin.

3. **Link Tasks Directly:**
   - Add links to Jira tasks in Marvin for quick access. Use Marvin’s task notes or URLs for this.

4. **Focus Marvin on Personal Workflow:**
   - Use Marvin as your “escape” system to plan, reflect, and track personal goals. You can manually decide what to pull in from Jira to avoid frustration.

If you’d like, I can guide you through setting up specific parts of Amazing Marvin or brainstorm ways to simplify your work with Jira!

**You:**

*2024-12-30 10:53:08*

OK - please help me set this up.  Let's start small with my personal to-do list.  What I need is the ability to segment something into a "personal" folder or category so it doesn't integrate with work.  then I'd like to add tasks, but within these tasks I want to take notes so I don't lose information by writing everything down on a piece of paper and losing it.  This is some kind of to do list with notes?  

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 10:53:25*

Got it! Let’s start with a **personal to-do list with note-taking** in Amazing Marvin, keeping it separate from work. Here's how to set it up step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Create a Personal Category**
1. Go to the **Categories/Folders** section in Amazing Marvin.
   - Find this under "Settings" > "Lists, Folders & Tags" > "Categories."
2. Create a new category called **Personal**.
   - Optionally, use a distinct color/icon to differentiate it.
3. Add subcategories if needed (e.g., "Health," "Finances," "Family," "Hobbies").

---

### **Step 2: Set Up a Master Task List**
1. Go to the **Master List** (or enable it if it’s not visible yet in "Features").
   - This is where you’ll dump all tasks initially.
2. Add your **Personal tasks** and assign them to the **Personal category**.
   - When adding a task, select the category "Personal" from the dropdown.

---

### **Step 3: Enable Notes for Tasks**
1. Enable **Notes** for each task:
   - Click on any task to open the **Task Details** popup.
   - In the popup, there’s a field for **Notes**. Use this space to write down any additional details.
2. Keep all relevant information in these notes, so you don’t lose details scribbled on paper.

---

### **Step 4: Create a "Personal View"**
1. Go to "Settings" > "Custom Views" and create a **Personal View**:
   - Filter by the **Personal category** only.
   - Save it as “Personal Dashboard” or a similar name.
2. Add this view to your sidebar or as a top-level menu item for easy access.

---

### **Step 5: Optional - Add Due Dates or Priorities**
1. When adding tasks, you can include:
   - **Due Dates**: To ensure you don’t miss deadlines.
   - **Priorities**: Mark important tasks to focus on them.
2. These settings will automatically sort your tasks in most views.

---

### **Step 6: Daily Usage**
- Open your **Personal View** daily to add or review tasks.
- For each task:
   - Write down any information you’d otherwise jot on paper directly into the notes section.
   - Check off completed tasks, or reschedule overdue ones.

---

### Example Workflow
1. **Task:** “Book appointment with vet.”
   - Assign to category: **Personal > Family > Pet Care.**
   - Notes: Add details like “Cookie needs a rabies vaccine. Call by Friday to get Saturday appointment.”

2. **Task:** “Buy new jeans.”
   - Assign to category: **Personal > Shopping.**
   - Notes: “Look for Levi’s in dark wash, size 32.”

Let me know if you’d like more specific tweaks or additional features like reminders or recurring tasks! We can expand as you get more comfortable with Marvin.

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 10:56:57*

i cant find that under the settings tab - FYI I'm using the mac version

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 10:57:16*

Thanks for the clarification! The Mac app for Amazing Marvin has a slightly different layout than the web version. Let me guide you step-by-step based on the app interface:

---

### **Step 1: Open the Categories/Folders Feature**
1. In the **Mac app**, click on the menu at the top left corner (three horizontal lines).
2. Scroll down to find **Settings** and click it.
3. In the **Settings menu**, look for "Lists, Folders & Tags" or just "Categories." 
   - If you don’t see this, it might be hidden. Use the **search bar** in the Settings panel to type "Categories."

---

### **Step 2: Add a Personal Category**
1. Once in the **Categories** section:
   - Click **Add New Category** (or the "+" icon).
   - Name the new category **Personal.**
   - Assign a color/icon to differentiate it from other categories.
2. (Optional) Create subcategories under "Personal" if needed, like:
   - **Health**
   - **Hobbies**
   - **Family**

---

### **Step 3: Create a Personal Task**
1. From your main dashboard, click the **+ Add Task** button.
2. When adding a task:
   - Look for a **Category dropdown** (usually near the task name or in the task details).
   - Select **Personal** from the dropdown.
   - Save the task.

---

### **Step 4: Add Notes to Tasks**
1. After adding a task, click on it to open the **Task Details panel**.
2. In the details panel, you’ll see a **Notes field**:
   - Type anything you need to keep track of (e.g., details, links, ideas).
3. Notes are saved automatically, so they’ll always be there when you revisit the task.

---

### **Step 5: Personal View Setup**
1. Look for the **Custom Views** tab in the app sidebar or under **Settings**.
2. Create a new view:
   - Name it **Personal Tasks.**
   - Filter tasks by the **Personal category**.
3. Save this view and pin it to your dashboard for quick access.

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips for Mac App**
- If you can’t find a feature, use the **Search bar** in the app settings to locate it.
- Amazing Marvin updates its UI frequently. If something seems missing, check their [help docs](https://help.amazingmarvin.com/) or let me know—I can guide you further.

Does this help? If you’re still stuck, we can explore together further!

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 10:59:00*

it's literally not there

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 10:59:14*

Got it! Let’s figure this out together. Amazing Marvin can be quirky, and sometimes features need to be enabled before they appear. Here’s what you can do:

---

### **Step 1: Enable the Categories Feature**
1. Open the **Mac app** and go to **Settings**:
   - On Mac, this might be under the sidebar menu or accessed via the Marvin logo in the top-left.
2. In the Settings panel, find **Features** (this is where you enable/disable modules).
3. Look for **Categories** or **Folders/Lists** in the list of features:
   - If you don’t see it immediately, use the search bar at the top of the Features list and type “Categories.”
   - Once found, toggle it **ON**.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Personal Category**
After enabling the **Categories** feature:
1. Return to your main dashboard.
2. You should now see a **Categories panel** or option to manage Categories:
   - Click on it and create a new **Personal** category.
3. Follow the earlier instructions to assign tasks to this category.

---

### **Step 3: Customize Your View**
If you still can’t find the Categories option, another workaround is to create a custom view to separate personal tasks:
1. Go to **Settings > Views & Dashboards**.
2. Create a new view:
   - Name it **Personal Tasks.**
   - Use the filter to only show tasks **tagged** with “Personal” (you can tag tasks manually).
3. Save this view and pin it to your sidebar.

---

### **Alternative Workaround: Use Tags**
If Categories are still unavailable:
1. Use **Tags** to label tasks as "Personal":
   - Add the "Personal" tag to tasks as you create them.
2. Filter tasks by the "Personal" tag in the main view.

---

If none of this works or the features aren’t appearing, let’s try syncing the app:
1. Ensure you’re running the latest version of the Amazing Marvin Mac app.
2. Log in to Marvin’s **web app** ([app.amazingmarvin.com](https://app.amazingmarvin.com)) and check if the Categories feature is visible there.

Let me know how it goes, and we can keep troubleshooting!

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:10:21*

ok I have the category.  I've put tasks in there and labeled them personal

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:10:41*

Awesome! You're off to a great start. Now let's make your **Personal category** as functional as possible by organizing tasks, adding notes, and making it easier to access.

---

### **Step 1: Add Notes to Your Tasks**
1. **Open a Task**:
   - Click on any task in the Personal category to open the **Task Details panel**.
2. **Find the Notes Field**:
   - In the Task Details panel, look for a field labeled **Notes** (it might also be called “Description” depending on your setup).
3. **Add Details**:
   - Type anything you need to keep track of: ideas, links, reminders, or progress updates.
   - Notes will stay attached to the task, so you can always reference them.

---

### **Step 2: Customize Your View for Easy Access**
1. **Pin the Personal Category to Your Sidebar**:
   - In the Categories menu, look for a way to **pin or favorite** the Personal category (usually a star or pin icon).
   - This makes it accessible directly from the sidebar.

2. **Create a Filtered View**:
   - Go to **Settings > Views & Dashboards**.
   - Create a new view:
     - **Name:** Personal Dashboard.
     - **Filter:** Set it to show tasks only in the **Personal** category.
   - Save and pin this view to your dashboard or sidebar.

---

### **Step 3: Organize Your Tasks**
1. **Set Due Dates**:
   - Add due dates for tasks where needed. This will help you prioritize.
   - Tasks will then show up in date-based views, like "Today" or "This Week."

2. **Add Subtasks**:
   - If any of your tasks have multiple steps, break them down into **subtasks**:
     - Open a task and click the option to add **Subtasks** (usually a "+" sign or a "Checklist" option).
     - Example: 
       - **Task:** Plan Cookie's vet visit.
       - **Subtasks:** 
         - Look up vet’s number.
         - Call for appointment.
         - Write down vaccination details.

---

### **Step 4: Start Using Daily**
1. **Review Tasks Daily**:
   - Check your **Personal Dashboard** or Personal category every morning.
   - Add new tasks or update existing ones.
2. **Add Notes as You Work**:
   - Use the **Notes field** for each task to jot down thoughts or progress updates as you go.
   - Example: "Called vet, waiting for a callback."

---

### **Step 5: Optional - Enhance Your Setup**
1. **Recurring Tasks**:
   - For tasks that repeat (e.g., paying bills), set them as recurring in the Task Details.
2. **Reminders**:
   - Enable reminders for time-sensitive tasks to get notifications.

---

Let me know how this is working for you! If you want to expand with more features like habit tracking or integrating goals, we can tackle those next. 😊

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:12:31*

views and dashboards are not in the settings

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:12:54*

Thanks for sticking with me! Amazing Marvin can be quirky with its terminology and interface. If **Views and Dashboards** aren’t explicitly visible in the **Settings**, it’s possible that the feature isn’t activated yet, or it might be under a different label. Here's how to work around it:

---

### **Step 1: Access or Enable Custom Views**
1. **Locate "Custom Views"**:
   - On the **Mac app dashboard**, look for a menu or section titled **Custom Views** (it may be in the sidebar or hidden under a dropdown menu).
   - If you can’t find it, go to **Settings > Features** and search for "Custom Views" to ensure it’s enabled.

2. **Enable Custom Views**:
   - In the **Features menu**, toggle on "Custom Views" if it’s available.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up a Personal View**
If "Custom Views" is available:
1. Go to the **Custom Views** menu or tab.
2. Create a new view:
   - **Name:** Personal Dashboard.
   - **Filter:** Set it to show tasks only in the **Personal** category.
3. Save this view and pin it for easy access.

---

### **Step 3: Alternative Workaround Using Sidebar or Starred Views**
If "Custom Views" still isn’t an option:
1. **Pin the Personal Category**:
   - Open the **Categories menu** (from the main dashboard or sidebar).
   - Look for an option to **star, pin, or favorite** the Personal category. This will keep it in your sidebar for quick access.

2. **Use a Tag-Based Approach**:
   - If filtering by category isn’t working well, you can create a **Personal tag**.
   - Tag all tasks under the Personal category and then filter your tasks by this tag instead.

---

### **Step 4: Save Your Workspace**
If Marvin doesn’t allow you to create or save custom views, try this:
1. Organize your dashboard manually:
   - Open only the **Personal category**.
   - Rearrange your tasks (e.g., by due date or priority).
2. Save this layout as your default workspace.

---

### Let’s Keep Tweaking!
If none of this works, let me know what you're seeing in your app. Amazing Marvin’s flexibility sometimes gets in its own way, but we’ll get it to work for you! 😊

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:22:01*

i have a personal category and then a list view of tasks

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:22:25*

Perfect! Now that you’ve got a **Personal category** and a **list view of tasks**, you’re in a great spot. Let’s optimize this so it becomes your go-to personal task manager. Here's how you can work with what you have:

---

### **Step 1: Organize Your Task List**
1. **Prioritize Your Tasks**:
   - For each task, assign a **priority level** (if the feature is enabled):
     - High Priority
     - Medium Priority
     - Low Priority
   - This will help you focus on the most important tasks first.

2. **Add Subtasks**:
   - Break large tasks into smaller, actionable steps directly in the list view:
     - Right-click or use the task options to add **subtasks** under a main task.
     - Example:
       - Main Task: "Plan Cookie's vet visit."
       - Subtasks: 
         - Call the vet.
         - Book appointment.
         - Write down the date/time.

---

### **Step 2: Use Notes to Capture Details**
1. **Open Task Notes**:
   - Click on a task to open the **details panel** (or click the pencil/edit icon if it’s there).
   - Add any details, thoughts, or links into the **Notes** section for that task.
   - Example:
     - Task: "Buy jeans."
     - Notes: "Look for Levi's 501, dark wash, size 32."

2. **Stay Organized**:
   - Keep notes concise but detailed enough to avoid needing to write things down elsewhere.

---

### **Step 3: Enable Due Dates and Reminders**
1. **Set Due Dates**:
   - For each task, assign a due date to ensure it appears in date-based views (like “Today” or “This Week”).
   - To do this, open the task details and look for the **due date** option.

2. **Turn on Reminders**:
   - If you need to be reminded of a specific task, enable reminders or notifications.

---

### **Step 4: Filter for Personal Tasks Only**
1. **Pin Your Personal Category**:
   - If you haven’t already, **pin or star the Personal category** so it’s easily accessible in your sidebar.
2. **Work from the Personal View**:
   - When you want to focus, click directly on the **Personal category** to see only those tasks.

---

### **Step 5: Optional - Use Tags for Extra Organization**
1. Add **Tags** to Tasks:
   - Tags can help you group tasks by context or type, even within the Personal category.
   - Example tags: "Errands," "Shopping," "Family."

2. Filter by Tags:
   - Use the search or filtering options in the list view to focus on tasks with a specific tag.

---

### Daily Workflow Example
1. Open Marvin.
2. Click **Personal category** to see your list of tasks.
3. Review what’s due today or what’s high priority.
4. As you work on tasks, add notes or update progress.
5. Check off tasks as you complete them.

---

### Let Me Know!
If there’s a specific feature or workflow you’re trying to use but can’t find, let me know—I’ll guide you further! 😊

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:23:26*

Can I move categories into other categories>?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:23:38*

Yes, in **Amazing Marvin**, you can nest categories to create a hierarchy (like folders within folders). This is great for organizing your tasks more granularly. Here’s how you can move categories into other categories:

---

### **Step 1: Access the Category Settings**
1. Go to your **Categories** list:
   - This is typically found in the sidebar or via the Settings menu under "Lists, Folders & Tags" or just "Categories."

---

### **Step 2: Drag and Drop (If Supported)**
1. Check if you can drag and drop categories:
   - Hover over a category in the list.
   - Try dragging it onto another category to make it a subcategory.

---

### **Step 3: Edit the Category**
1. **Right-Click or Edit**:
   - Right-click (or click the options icon, usually a three-dot menu) on the category you want to move.
   - Select **Edit Category** or an option like "Move."
2. **Set a Parent Category**:
   - In the edit menu, look for an option to assign a **Parent Category**.
   - Choose the category where you want this one nested.

---

### **Step 4: Confirm the Changes**
1. Once the category has a parent, it will appear indented or nested under the parent category.
2. Check your category list to ensure it’s organized as you intended.

---

### Example:
- **Top-Level Category**: Personal
   - **Subcategories**:
     - Health
     - Hobbies
     - Finances

---

If you don’t see the drag-and-drop or nesting options, let me know what’s happening, and I’ll help troubleshoot! 😊

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:33:37*

OK I got it

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:33:40*

Awesome! 🎉 Now you’ve got categories nested and your setup is looking more organized. Let me know if you want to tweak anything further or explore other features like recurring tasks, reminders, or project tracking. You’re on your way to mastering Amazing Marvin! 😊

---

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:34:03*

any direct way to move an email into a task?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:34:18*

Amazing Marvin doesn’t currently have a direct integration to move an email into a task, but there are a few effective workarounds to streamline the process. Here’s how you can handle it:

---

### **Option 1: Use Email-to-Task Workflow with Links**
1. **Copy the Email Link:**
   - In Gmail or Outlook, open the email you want to turn into a task.
   - Click on the "More" or "Options" menu in the email and find the **"Copy Link to Email"** option.
   - This generates a link directly to the email.

2. **Create a New Task in Marvin:**
   - Add a task in Amazing Marvin like "Follow up on client email."
   - Paste the email link in the **Notes** section of the task for easy access.

---

### **Option 2: Use Third-Party Tools (Zapier or Make)**
If you want automation:
1. **Set Up Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat):**
   - Create a Zap/Scenario that triggers when an email arrives or is labeled (e.g., "To-Do").
   - Configure it to send the email information (e.g., subject, body, link) to Amazing Marvin via a webhook.
2. **Webhook Integration:**
   - Amazing Marvin supports **webhooks**, so Zapier or Make can send the email info directly into your task list.

---

### **Option 3: Manual Email-to-Task Workflow**
1. **Copy Email Content:**
   - Open the email and copy the subject line or important details.
2. **Create a New Task:**
   - Paste the subject or key details into the **task name**.
   - Add additional content in the **Notes** section for context.
3. **Attach Files/Links:**
   - If needed, save email attachments or links and reference them in the task.

---

### **Option 4: Use a Dedicated Email-to-Task App**
1. **Install a Browser Extension or App**:
   - Tools like **Todoist**, **ClickUp**, or **Trello** offer browser extensions for one-click email-to-task creation.
   - While not directly integrated with Marvin, you could use one of these tools as a "bridge."

2. **Sync with Marvin**:
   - Manually pull tasks from the intermediary app into Marvin if needed.

---

### **Pro Tip: Forwarding Emails to Marvin**
Amazing Marvin doesn’t yet offer a custom email address for task creation, but if this feature becomes available, you could simply forward emails to it. Keep an eye on their [feature requests page](https://feedback.amazingmarvin.com).

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:50:08*

but the Gmail extension only goes to the inbox, you can't customize.  In order to do that you need to for4ward the email?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:50:19*

You're correct; the **Amazing Marvin browser extension** for Gmail adds emails as tasks directly to your inbox without customization options for assigning them to specific projects or categories. To achieve more precise task organization, consider the following methods:

### **Method 1: Forward Emails with Specific Subject Line Shortcuts**

By forwarding emails to your unique Marvin email address and including specific shortcuts in the subject line, you can direct tasks to particular projects or categories. Here's how:

1. **Find Your Unique Marvin Email Address**:
   - In Amazing Marvin, navigate to **Settings**.
   - Go to **Strategies** and select **Email to Marvin**.
   - Your unique Marvin email address will be displayed there.

2. **Forward the Email with Customized Subject Line**:
   - In your email client, forward the desired email to your Marvin email address.
   - Modify the subject line to include shortcuts that specify the project, due date, labels, etc.

   **Examples**:
   - To add a task to a project named "ClientA":
     ```
     Subject: Prepare sales report #ClientA
     ```
   - To add a task with a due date and label:
     ```
     Subject: Prepare sales report due tomorrow @work #ClientA
     ```

   *Note*: If you have multiple projects with the same name, use the unique project ID to ensure accuracy. You can find the project ID by enabling the **Deep Links** strategy in Marvin, hovering over the project, and clicking the anchor icon to copy the link. The ID is the part after `#p=` in the URL. citeturn0search3

### **Method 2: Use Zapier for Automated Task Creation**

If you prefer automation, you can use **Zapier** to create tasks in Amazing Marvin based on specific triggers in your email, such as applying a particular label in Gmail.

1. **Set Up a Zapier Account**:
   - If you don't have one, sign up at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

2. **Create a New Zap**:
   - **Trigger**: Choose Gmail and set the trigger to "New Labeled Email."
   - **Action**: Select Amazing Marvin and set the action to "Create Task."

3. **Customize the Task**:
   - Map the email subject to the task title and the email body to the task notes.
   - Use Zapier's customization options to assign the task to specific projects or categories within Marvin.

This setup allows for more tailored task creation based on your email management preferences. citeturn0search6

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:52:26*

Labeling an email as "project 123" in your email client won't automatically create a task in Amazing Marvin. However, you can achieve this integration by using tools like **Zapier** to automate the process. Here's how you can set it up:

### **Method: Automate Task Creation with Zapier**

**1. Set Up a Zapier Account:**
   - If you don't have one, sign up at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

**2. Create a New Zap:**
   - **Trigger:**
     - Choose your email client (e.g., Gmail).
     - Set the trigger to "New Labeled Email" and specify the label "project 123".
   - **Action:**
     - Select Amazing Marvin.
     - Set the action to "Create Task".

**3. Customize the Task:**
   - Map the email subject to the task title and the email body to the task notes.
   - Use Zapier's customization options to assign the task to the specific project "project 123" within Marvin.

This setup allows for automated task creation in Amazing Marvin when you label an email as "project 123" in your email client.

**You:**

*2024-12-30 11:53:26*

ok - so if I have a project labeled "Project 123" in marvin, then if i labvel the email "project 123" it will automatically send it over to marvin?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 11:53:39*

Yes, by setting up an automation using **Zapier**, you can configure your system so that when you label an email as "project 123" in Gmail, a corresponding task is automatically created in Amazing Marvin under the "Project 123" category. Here's how to set it up:

### **Step 1: Set Up a Zapier Account**

1. **Sign Up or Log In**:
   - If you don't have a Zapier account, sign up at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).
   - If you already have an account, log in.

### **Step 2: Create a New Zap**

1. **Start a New Zap**:
   - Click on **"Create Zap"** in your Zapier dashboard.

2. **Set Up the Trigger**:
   - **App**: Select **Gmail**.
   - **Trigger Event**: Choose **"New Labeled Email"**.
   - **Account**: Connect your Gmail account.
   - **Label**: Select or enter **"project 123"**.

3. **Set Up the Action**:
   - **App**: Search for and select **Amazing Marvin**.
   - **Action Event**: Choose **"Create Task"**.
   - **Account**: Connect your Amazing Marvin account.
   - **Customize Task**:
     - **Title**: Map to the email's subject line.
     - **Notes**: Map to the email's body content.
     - **Category**: Enter **"Project 123"**.

4. **Test and Activate**:
   - Test the Zap to ensure it's working correctly.
   - If successful, turn on the Zap.

### **Important Considerations**

- **Unique Project Names**: Ensure that the project name in Amazing Marvin exactly matches the label used in Gmail.

- **Multiple Projects with the Same Name**: If you have multiple projects named "Project 123" in Amazing Marvin, the task may not be assigned correctly. To avoid this, use the project's unique ID in the Zapier setup. You can find the project ID by enabling the **Deep Links** strategy in Marvin, hovering over the project, and clicking the anchor icon to copy the link. The ID is the part after `#p=` in the URL. citeturn0search4

- **Zapier Integration Limitations**: Currently, Amazing Marvin's integration with Zapier allows for creating tasks based on triggers from other apps, but it doesn't support triggers that start inside Marvin. citeturn0search2

### **Additional Resources**

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to Amazing Marvin's help articles on integrating with Zapier:

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-30 16:38:17*

Integrating **Jira** with **Amazing Marvin** can streamline your workflow by automatically creating tasks in Marvin based on activities in Jira. Here are two primary methods to achieve this integration:

### **Method 1: Using Zapier for Integration**

**Zapier** is a no-code automation platform that connects different applications, enabling you to automate tasks between them.

**Steps to Integrate Jira with Amazing Marvin via Zapier:**

1. **Create Accounts:**
   - Ensure you have active accounts on both [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/).

2. **Set Up a New Zap:**
   - In Zapier, click on **"Create Zap"**.

3. **Configure the Trigger:**
   - **App:** Select **Jira Software Cloud**.
   - **Event:** Choose a trigger event, such as **"New Issue"** or **"Updated Issue"**, depending on your needs.
   - **Account:** Connect your Jira account to Zapier.
   - **Set Up Trigger:** Specify any filters or conditions to narrow down which Jira issues should trigger the automation.

4. **Configure the Action:**
   - **App:** Select **Amazing Marvin**.
   - **Event:** Choose **"Create Task"**.
   - **Account:** Connect your Amazing Marvin account to Zapier.
   - **Set Up Action:** Map the relevant Jira issue details (e.g., title, description, due date) to the corresponding fields in Amazing Marvin.

5. **Test and Activate:**
   - Test the Zap to ensure it functions as expected.
   - Once confirmed, activate the Zap to start automating the process.

This setup ensures that whenever a specified event occurs in Jira, a corresponding task is automatically created in Amazing Marvin, keeping your task management synchronized.

**Reference:**
- Zapier Integration for Jira Software Cloud and Amazing Marvin: citeturn0search0

### **Method 2: Using a Custom Script**

For a more tailored integration, especially if you have specific requirements not covered by Zapier, you can use a custom script.

**Example: Jira to Amazing Marvin Integration Script**

A developer has created a Python script that fetches tasks (issues) from Jira and adds them into Amazing Marvin as projects.

**Key Details:**

- **Requirements:**
  - JIRA_API_KEY
  - MARVIN_API_KEY

- **Configuration:**
  - Settings are managed via a `settings.json` file.

- **Usage:**
  - The script can be customized to fit your specific needs, such as filtering certain types of issues or assigning tasks to specific categories in Amazing Marvin.

**Reference:**
- GitHub Repository: citeturn0search1

**Considerations:**

- **Technical Expertise:** Implementing a custom script requires programming knowledge, particularly in Python.

- **Maintenance:** Custom scripts may require ongoing maintenance to accommodate changes in APIs or workflow adjustments.

- **Security:** Ensure that API keys and other sensitive information are stored securely and that the script complies with your organization's security policies.

By choosing the method that best fits your technical capabilities and workflow requirements, you can effectively integrate Jira with Amazing Marvin to enhance your productivity and task management efficiency.
