"To Sell is Human" by Daniel H. Pink explores the idea that selling isn't confined to traditional sales roles; instead, it's a fundamental aspect of human interaction. Pink argues that whether we're pitching ideas, persuading colleagues, or encouraging children to do their homework, we're all in sales. He introduces the new ABCs of selling: Attunement (understanding others' perspectives), Buoyancy (staying resilient amidst rejection), and Clarity (making sense of complex situations). The book also offers practical strategies, such as various pitching techniques and the importance of improvisation and serving others, to enhance one's ability to move others effectively.

To craft a 20-minute presentation around this book, consider the following outline:

1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**
   - Open with a relatable anecdote illustrating everyday selling, such as convincing a friend to try a new restaurant.
   - Introduce the premise: everyone is involved in sales in some capacity.

2. **The Ubiquity of Selling (3 minutes):**
   - Present statistics or findings that show how a significant portion of our time is spent persuading or influencing others.
   - Emphasize that this applies across professions, not just in traditional sales roles.

3. **The New ABCs of Selling (9 minutes):**
   - **Attunement (3 minutes):**
     - Define attunement as understanding and aligning with others' perspectives.
     - Share techniques like perspective-taking and strategic mimicry to build rapport.
   - **Buoyancy (3 minutes):**
     - Explain buoyancy as maintaining resilience in the face of rejection.
     - Discuss methods such as positive self-talk and reinterpreting setbacks to stay motivated.
   - **Clarity (3 minutes):**
     - Describe clarity as the ability to identify problems and articulate solutions clearly.
     - Highlight the importance of problem-finding over problem-solving and how to frame information effectively.

4. **Practical Application: The Six Successors to the Elevator Pitch (4 minutes):**
   - Introduce the six pitching techniques:
     - **The One-Word Pitch:** Condense your message into a single, powerful word.
     - **The Question Pitch:** Pose a question that prompts reflection and engagement.
     - **The Rhyming Pitch:** Use rhymes to make your message more memorable.
     - **The Subject-Line Pitch:** Craft compelling email subject lines that entice opening.
     - **The Twitter Pitch:** Convey your message within 280 characters, focusing on brevity and clarity.
     - **The Pixar Pitch:** Structure your pitch as a story following the Pixar narrative formula.
   - Provide brief examples of each to demonstrate their effectiveness.

5. **Conclusion (2 minutes):**
   - Recap the key points discussed.
   - Reinforce the idea that embracing these principles can enhance personal and professional interactions.
   - Encourage the audience to apply these concepts in their daily lives to become more effective in their persuasive efforts.

This structure ensures a comprehensive overview of Pink's key concepts, with practical examples to engage and inform your audience.

is there a way that I can remove myself from emails that I don't want - I get so many stupid emails that I don't have any reason to read

Hey Mark,

Dealing with unwanted emails can be a real hassle, but there are several strategies you can use to declutter your inbox:

1. **Unsubscribe Directly:** Legitimate marketing emails usually include an "Unsubscribe" link, often found at the bottom of the message. Clicking this link should remove you from their mailing list. Some email services, like Gmail and Apple Mail, also offer an unsubscribe option at the top of the email for recognized newsletters.

2. **Mark as Spam or Junk:** If you receive emails without an unsubscribe option or from unknown senders, marking them as spam will train your email provider to filter similar messages into your spam folder in the future. citeturn0search5

3. **Block the Sender:** Most email platforms allow you to block specific email addresses. In Gmail, for example, you can open the email, click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, and select "Block [Sender]." This will prevent future emails from that address from reaching your inbox. citeturn0search2

4. **Set Up Email Filters:** You can create rules to automatically sort or delete incoming emails based on criteria like the sender's address, subject line, or keywords. In Gmail, go to Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses > Create a new filter. This helps manage unwanted emails without manual intervention. citeturn0search1

5. **Use Third-Party Unsubscribe Tools:** Services like Clean Email and Unroll.me can help you manage and unsubscribe from multiple email lists simultaneously. These tools scan your inbox for subscriptions and allow you to opt out with a few clicks. Keep in mind that while some of these services are free, they may monetize by analyzing your email data, so choose one that aligns with your privacy preferences. citeturn0search4

6. **Avoid Interacting with Suspicious Emails:** Be cautious with emails from unknown sources, especially those lacking an unsubscribe link. Interacting with such emails can confirm to spammers that your address is active, potentially increasing unwanted messages. Instead, mark them as spam and delete them. citeturn0search5

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the number of unwanted emails cluttering your inbox.

**Assistant:**

Hey Mark,

I get how frustrating it can be to be looped into emails that don't concern you. Here are some steps to help manage and reduce those irrelevant CCs:

1. **Communicate Your Preferences:** Have a chat with your colleagues about the types of emails you find relevant. Let them know you'd prefer not to be CC'd on projects outside your scope. This open communication can help them be more mindful when including recipients.

2. **Set Up Email Filters:** Use your email client's filtering options to automatically sort or archive emails where you're CC'd. For instance, in Outlook, you can create a rule to move emails where you're not the primary recipient to a separate folder. This keeps your main inbox focused on priority messages.

3. **Educate on CC Etiquette:** Sometimes, people overuse the CC function without realizing its impact. Sharing resources or guidelines on proper email etiquette can encourage more thoughtful communication. For example, only those who need to know should be CC'd, and responses should be limited to those directly involved. citeturn0search3

4. **Use the 'Ignore' Feature:** In some email clients like Outlook, there's an 'Ignore' option that moves the entire email thread to Deleted Items. If a conversation is completely irrelevant, this can be a quick way to declutter.

5. **Discuss with Management:** If the issue persists, consider bringing it up with your manager. They can provide support and may address the team to ensure everyone is more considerate with their email practices.

By implementing these strategies, you can reduce the influx of unnecessary emails and keep your inbox more manageable.

Hey Mark,

I understand you're looking to manage email threads in Gmail that aren't relevant to you. Gmail's **Mute** feature is perfect for this, as it allows you to archive a conversation and automatically bypass your inbox for any future replies in that thread. Here's how you can mute and unmute conversations:

**Muting a Conversation:**

1. **On Desktop:**
   - Open Gmail and locate the email thread you wish to mute.
   - Select the email by clicking the checkbox next to it.
   - Click on the "More" button (three vertical dots) at the top of the page.
   - From the dropdown menu, select "Mute." citeturn0search0

   *Alternatively, if you have keyboard shortcuts enabled, you can open the email and press the "M" key to mute the conversation.*

2. **On Mobile (Gmail App):**
   - Open the Gmail app and find the conversation you want to mute.
   - Tap and hold the email to select it.
   - Tap the three vertical dots in the top-right corner.
   - Choose "Mute" from the dropdown menu. citeturn0search2

**Unmuting a Conversation:**

1. **On Desktop:**
   - In the search bar at the top of Gmail, type `is:muted` and press Enter to display all muted conversations.
   - Open the conversation you wish to unmute.
   - Click on the "More" button (three vertical dots) and select "Unmute." citeturn0search1

2. **On Mobile (Gmail App):**
   - Use the search function to find the muted conversation by typing `is:muted`.
   - Open the desired email thread.
   - Tap the three vertical dots in the top-right corner.
   - Select "Unmute" from the menu. citeturn0search2

**Note:** Muted conversations are archived and won't appear in your inbox unless:
- A message is sent directly to you (your email address is in the "To" or "Cc" field).
- You search for the conversation manually.

This feature is particularly useful for silencing ongoing email threads that aren't pertinent to your work, helping you maintain a more organized and focused inbox.

For more detailed information, you can refer to Google's official support page on archiving or muting Gmail messages. citeturn0search3

can i send it to a muted folder?

---

**Assistant:**

*2024-12-31 09:31:59*

Hey Mark,

In Gmail, when you **mute** a conversation, it automatically skips your inbox and is archived, effectively removing it from your immediate view. Muted emails are stored in the "All Mail" section and can be retrieved by searching for them or by using the search operator `is:muted`. citeturn0search0

If you'd prefer to have these muted conversations stored in a specific folder (known as "labels" in Gmail) for better organization, you can set up a filter to achieve this. Here's how:

1. **Create a New Label:**
   - On the left sidebar of your Gmail interface, scroll down and click on "More," then select "Create new label."
   - Name the label (e.g., "Muted Conversations") and click "Create."

2. **Set Up a Filter:**
   - In the search bar at the top, click the downward-facing arrow to open the advanced search options.
   - In the "Has the words" field, enter `is:muted`.
   - Click on "Create filter" at the bottom right of the search window.

3. **Apply Actions to the Filter:**
   - In the filter creation window, check the box that says "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)."
   - Check the box for "Apply the label:" and select your newly created label ("Muted Conversations").
   - Optionally, check "Also apply filter to matching conversations" to include existing muted emails.
   - Click "Create filter" to finalize.

With this filter in place, any conversation you mute will automatically be archived and labeled accordingly, allowing you to access all muted conversations by clicking on the "Muted Conversations" label in the sidebar.

This setup helps keep your inbox uncluttered while ensuring that muted emails are organized in a designated folder for easy access.

For more detailed instructions on creating filters and labels, you can refer to this guide: citeturn0search1

I hope this helps you manage your emails more effectively!
