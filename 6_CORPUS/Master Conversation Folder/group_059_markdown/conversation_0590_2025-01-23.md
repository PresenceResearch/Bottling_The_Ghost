can you take the gross margin number and allocate some of it into an "overhead" line item, a "soft cost" line item, and then distribute the rest of the Gross margin into individual line items proportionately pro-rated.  2025

To allocate the gross margin into overhead, soft costs, and distribute the remainder proportionally across the line items, I’ll:

1. Allocate a specific portion for overhead and soft costs.
2. Distribute the remaining gross margin proportionally to the costs of each line item based on their percentages.
3. Create a table showing the updated line items with the reallocated gross margin.

Let me know the percentages or amounts you'd like to allocate for overhead and soft costs, or if you’d like me to choose default values (e.g., 10% for overhead, 10% for soft costs, and the remainder distributed proportionally).

what do you think is standard for overhead and soft costs for a construction company

**Assistant:**

For construction companies, typical **overhead** and **soft costs** percentages vary depending on the company size, project scope, and industry norms. Here’s a general breakdown:

### **Overhead**
- Overhead typically ranges between **10-15%** of total project revenue.
- This includes costs like office expenses, management salaries, insurance, and other non-project-specific expenses.

### **Soft Costs**
- Soft costs often range between **10-20%** of total project revenue.
- These include costs such as design, permitting, engineering, legal fees, and other project-specific expenses that are not directly tied to labor or materials.

### Suggestion for Allocation:
- **Overhead:** 10%
- **Soft Costs:** 15%
- **Remaining Gross Margin:** Allocate the remaining 22.11% proportionally to the line items based on their direct costs.

Would you like to proceed with these percentages, or adjust them?

I have reallocated the gross margin into overhead, soft costs, and proportionately distributed the remaining amount to individual line items. You can now review the updated table in detail. Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!
