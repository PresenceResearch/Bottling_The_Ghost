Re: Hydro-Terra – BAE Water Treatment Facility Solar Installation Update
Dear Mr. Myers,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit an updated proposal for the 41 kW DC solar photovoltaic array located at 1100 Bairs Road, York, PA 17408.

Project Description
Array Design and Location: Updated to optimize performance and ensure compliance with current regulations.
Cost: Updated to reflect current market conditions and regulatory requirements.

Scope of Work Update
Solar Modules: 100 Trina 410 Watt modules
Racking System: Pre-engineered to meet the latest safety and structural standards
Inverters: SolarEdge DC-to-AC power-optimized, ensuring efficient energy conversion and system monitoring
Compliance: Installation in full compliance with current regulations and standards

Key Updates
Permits, Interconnection, and Engineering: Redone to comply with significant changes in code interpretation and system scope. This ensures that the project meets the latest regulatory requirements, avoiding potential delays and compliance issues.
Mesh Protection: Installed on all panels to meet updated safety standards, enhancing system durability and reducing the risk of accidents.

Project Inclusions
Updated project engineering (electrical and site-specific)
Re-application for all required local building permits
Re-submittal of interconnection documents (utility approval and documentation)
Full system installation, including mesh backing on all panels
Trenching from array to interconnection point
Ground remediation after trenching
System monitoring platform
Final inspection and system commissioning
Post-install training and handoff

Project Exclusions
Costs associated with unanticipated jurisdictional or utility requirements, such as utility infrastructure upgrades or additional site preparation.
Additional expenses related to unforeseen ground cover or structural modifications.

Lumina Solar Fee
Total Cost: $195,635

Reasons for Cost Increase
Changed Racking Design:
 The racking company has revised the array design to better align with current safety and structural standards. This change requires additional materials and labor, increasing the overall project cost. However, a portion of the racking materials already purchased will be utilized in the updated design.


Increased Consumables and Electrical Costs:
 The prices of consumables and electrical components have risen due to market fluctuations and supply chain challenges. These essential materials are necessary for the installation and proper functioning of the system.


Labor Costs:
 Labor costs represent a significant portion of the project budget. Due to the updated requirements and the need for more detailed and intricate work, the number of labor hours has increased substantially. Additionally, labor rates have risen over the past four years, further impacting the total cost.


Regulatory and Compliance Requirements:
 The reapplication for permits, interconnection, and engineering is necessary due to changes in code interpretation and system scope. These processes involve additional fees and the time required to complete them, contributing to the overall cost.


Mesh Protection:
 The installation of mesh protection on the backs of all panels is a new requirement to enhance system safety and durability. This additional measure requires additional materials and labor, increasing the project cost.



Adjustments for Purchased Equipment
Hydro-Terra has already purchased inverters and a portion of the racking. These costs will be deducted from the total project cost. The remaining balance of $27,665 from the initial $51,000 will be applied to the new project costs, minus storage fees and carrying costs, plus 4% annual interest. The total project cost becomes $167,980.

Summary
The updated cost stack for 2025 ensures the project meets all current codes, leverages the latest engineering optimizations, and reflects market-driven changes. These adjustments prioritize safety, durability, and long-term performance.

Allocation of Funds Received
To date, Lumina Solar has received $51,000 from Hydro-Terra. $17,822 has been spent on non-reusable services. The remaining balance of $27,665 will be applied to new project costs, minus storage fees and carrying costs, plus 4% annual interest. The total project cost becomes $167,980.

Sincerely,
 [Your Name]
