The Opportunity
11 Million Acres, a solar developer based in Chicago, expressed interest in partnering with us. Their Project Delivery Manager, Mike Nakayama, contacted me late last year to inquire about our capacity to install solar arrays on all Dollar General stores within our operational area.
There are over 60 locations in our Maryland region alone, many of which are located within a half-hour drive of our office.
Dollar General Locations - Metro DC and Baltimore

However, not all locations are candidates for solar installations.  Only freestanding stores are being considered at this point, which decreases the amount of viable locations.  I have calculated roughly 30 viable locations within the Baltimore Metro area.  
11 Million Acres has analyzed each location, which allows for easy identification of viable sites.
Sample Site Analysis: Note building type “Freestanding”


The Partner

11 Million Acres, a sustainability consulting firm, assists businesses in enhancing their environmental responsibility and operational efficiency. The firm offers a comprehensive suite of services, encompassing energy conservation, distributive energy solutions, microgrids, energy infrastructure, and renewable energy systems. Furthermore, 11 Million Acres provides flexible financing options, including operating and capital leases, tax equity investments, and power purchase agreements. Through these offerings, 11 Million Acres supports businesses in achieving their sustainability objectives while concurrently realizing their financial goals.

The Project

11 Million Acres requires a local partner who can manage the entire process, excluding the procurement of modules, inverters, and racking. Lumina will be responsible for site selection, evaluation, and recommendation of any necessary work that must be completed prior to installation, such as a roof replacement. After sites are evaluated, Lumina will begin the projects as we would any full EPC; site review, structural, permit, interconnection, etc.

Each site will host a 60 kW system. These systems are uniform throughout the portfolio. Actual design and module placement will be determined by Lumina.

Below, please find examples of potential sites in Baltimore:

717 Washington Blvd



5815 York Road



Timing:

Per Mike Nakayama:

 “We will start with IX applications in February and installs starting mid Q2 or early Q3.”

Proposed install timeline below:



Scope of Work

11 Million Acres will rely upon their local partner to visit and evaluate sites, determine suitability, and suggest any remedial work to be completed.  Any roofing replacements or repairs will be handled by Dollar General.

After suitability has been determined, installations will commence.

Scope of Work as outlined in RFP


Benefits:
A pipeline of multiple, smaller projects creates a backlog of opportunities that can be integrated into gaps in the installation schedule, regardless of the size of the gap.
Project sizes are such that residential crews can be utilized to supplement efforts should commercial installation teams be unavailable.
No capital outlay on equipment
Minimal initial use of internal resources.
Predictable cash flow
Large brand addition to Lumina Portfolio
Risk Exposure::
Solvency of Developer
Developer competency
Intermediary position between developer and site host
Delays caused by site unsuitability
Opportunity cost of committing resources to fixed profit projects
Pressure from Developer to lower prices for bulk orders
Preconstruction process may be more extensive than expected
Lumina's inability to deliver
Change order acceptance
Recommended Next Steps:
Reach an agreement on preliminary pricing
Compile a list of Lumina's terms and requirements:
Payment terms
Contract structure
Installation flexibility and timing
Provide to 11 Million Acres and schedule a meeting with their team next week.
