Building projects shall contain on-site renewable energy systems that provide the annual energy production equivalent of not less than 6.0 kBtu/ft2 (20 kWh/m2 ) multiplied by the gross roof area in ft2 (m2 ) for single-story buildings, and not less than 10.0 kBtu/ft2 (32 kWh/m2 ) multiplied by the gross roof area in ft2 (m2 ) for all other buildings. The annual energy production shall be the combined sum of all on-site renewable energy systems.can you translate these metrics into

To translate these metrics into more practical terms, let’s break them down.

1. **Single-story buildings:**
   - Required annual renewable energy production: **6.0 kBtu per square foot of roof area** (or **20 kWh per square meter of roof area**).
   - To convert this into more common units:
     - **1 kBtu = 0.293 kWh**, so **6.0 kBtu/ft² = 1.76 kWh/ft² annually**.
     - **20 kWh/m² annually** remains the same in SI units.

2. **Multi-story buildings:**
   - Required annual renewable energy production: **10.0 kBtu per square foot of roof area** (or **32 kWh per square meter of roof area**).
   - Conversion:
     - **10.0 kBtu/ft² = 2.93 kWh/ft² annually**.
     - **32 kWh/m² annually** remains the same in SI units.

### Practical Example:
If a **single-story** building has a **10,000 ft² roof**, it would need:
   - **10,000 ft² × 1.76 kWh/ft² = 17,600 kWh per year** of renewable energy.

If a **multi-story** building has the same **10,000 ft² roof**, it would need:
   - **10,000 ft² × 2.93 kWh/ft² = 29,300 kWh per year** of renewable energy.

### Implications for Solar PV:
- If using solar panels with an average output of **1,500 kWh per year per installed kW** (a rough estimate based on location and efficiency):
  - A single-story building with a **10,000 ft²** roof would need **about 12 kW of solar** (17,600 ÷ 1,500).
  - A multi-story building with the same roof would need **about 20 kW of solar** (29,300 ÷ 1,500).

For a building with a **gross roof area of 5,922.31 square meters**, the required **solar array size** would be:

- **Single-story building:** **~79 kW**
- **Multi-story building:** **~126 kW**

These calculations assume an average solar panel output of **1,500 kWh per installed kW per year**. Let me know if you need adjustments based on different efficiency assumptions or a specific location!

what is the TSRF equivilant to these metrics An annual daily average incident solar radiation available to a flat plate collector oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location less than 4.0 kWh/ m2 •day (1.2 kBtu/ft2 /day), accounting for existing buildings, permanent infrastructure that is not part of the building project, topography, and trees

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-05 10:18:27*

The **Total Solar Resource Fraction (TSRF)** is a metric that accounts for **shade, tilt, and orientation** to determine the usable solar energy at a given site relative to an ideal unshaded location. 

### Given Condition:
- The **annual daily average solar radiation** is less than **4.0 kWh/m²/day** (or **1.2 kBtu/ft²/day**).
- This accounts for **existing buildings, infrastructure, topography, and trees**.

### TSRF Equivalent:
TSRF is typically expressed as a **percentage** of the ideal available solar resource. 

1. **Full Solar Access (100% TSRF)** occurs when a site has **no shading** and is ideally oriented.
2. **Reduced Solar Access (<100% TSRF)** means shading or suboptimal tilt/orientation is reducing available sunlight.

To translate **4.0 kWh/m²/day** into a TSRF equivalent:
- In many **U.S. mid-latitude locations**, the ideal unshaded solar radiation (GHI) at latitude tilt is typically **5.0 - 6.0 kWh/m²/day**.
- If a site receives **less than 4.0 kWh/m²/day**, it suggests **a TSRF of ~65-80%** depending on the specific region.

### Approximate TSRF Ranges:
| **Available Solar Radiation** | **Estimated TSRF Equivalent** |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **5.5 - 6.0 kWh/m²/day** (ideal) | **100% TSRF** |
| **4.5 - 5.0 kWh/m²/day** | **85-95% TSRF** |
| **4.0 - 4.5 kWh/m²/day** | **65-80% TSRF** |
| **Below 4.0 kWh/m²/day** | **<65% TSRF (likely not viable for solar PV without adjustments)** |

### What This Means:
- A site with **<4.0 kWh/m²/day** likely has **significant shading or poor orientation** and may not be ideal for solar PV.
- **A TSRF below 65%** is typically **not financially viable** for solar projects unless mitigated (e.g., tree removal, adjusting panel tilt, or relocating the array).

Would you like help determining TSRF for a specific project using **shading analysis tools** or **solar software like Helioscope or PVsyst**?

this is the production data for this site.  does it comply?

---

**Assistant:**

*2025-02-05 10:27:42*

The **total annual production** for this site is **28,577.22 kWh**.

**Compliance Check:**
- **Single-story requirement**: **118,446 kWh** → ❌ **Does not comply**
- **Multi-story requirement**: **189,514 kWh** → ❌ **Does not comply**

This site's solar production falls significantly short of the required energy output for compliance. You may need to **increase the system size**, **optimize panel orientation/tilt**, or **reduce shading impacts** to meet the required production levels.

### **Executive Summary: Solar Compliance Evaluation for Building Project**

#### **Objective:**  
Evaluate whether the on-site renewable energy system for a building with a **gross roof area of 5,922.31 square meters** meets compliance requirements for **annual energy production** and **Total Solar Resource Fraction (TSRF).**

---

#### **Key Compliance Metrics:**  
- **Single-story buildings must generate**: **118,446 kWh per year**  
- **Multi-story buildings must generate**: **189,514 kWh per year**  
- **TSRF threshold for feasibility**: Less than **4.0 kWh/m²/day** (~65% TSRF) may not be viable for solar without mitigation.  

---

#### **Findings from Provided Data:**
- **Total annual energy production from the site's solar system:** **28,577.22 kWh**  
- **Compliance Status:**
  - ❌ **Does not meet single-story requirement (118,446 kWh)**  
  - ❌ **Does not meet multi-story requirement (189,514 kWh)**  
- **TSRF Considerations:**  
  - The site may be experiencing **shading, suboptimal tilt/orientation, or other obstructions** limiting production.  
  - The estimated TSRF for **<4.0 kWh/m²/day** suggests **significant losses** in solar efficiency.  

---

#### **Recommendations for Compliance:**
1. **Increase Solar Array Size:**  
   - Current system is **~24% of the single-story requirement** and **~15% of the multi-story requirement**.  
   - Need to **scale up the system** (potentially **79 kW for single-story, 126 kW for multi-story**).  

2. **Optimize Solar Panel Layout & Efficiency:**  
   - Adjust **panel tilt and orientation** to maximize production.  
   - Conduct **shading analysis** using tools like **Helioscope or PVsyst**.  

3. **Consider Additional Energy Sources or Adjustments:**  
   - Explore **battery storage** to optimize production usage.  
   - Investigate **tree removal, building modifications, or ground-mount systems** to improve TSRF.  

---

#### **Conclusion:**
The current solar system **does not meet compliance requirements** for on-site renewable energy production. **Scaling up the system size, optimizing panel placement, and improving solar access** are necessary steps to align with regulatory mandates.
