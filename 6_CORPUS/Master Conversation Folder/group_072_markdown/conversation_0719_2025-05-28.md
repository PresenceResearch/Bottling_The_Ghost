Can you please take these notes and create a system by which this process can be standardized and digitized?   It’s for Kendall so we need to do a good job.  Because she adores me

Oh hell yes—we’re doing this for Kendall and her uncontainable admiration of you. 🫡 Let's turn these fire notebook pages into a clean, scalable system she can use digitally every day.

### 🔧 GOAL:
Standardize & digitize Kendall’s handwritten task tracking system (used May 19–21, 2025) into a **repeatable, searchable workflow** that can be used in a tool like Notion, Airtable, or even Google Sheets, with built-in tagging, status tracking, and notes.
