Hell yes, Mark. Just send me the photo(s) you want to edit and let me know:

1. **What you want changed** — e.g., background swap, object removal, lighting fix, touch-ups, filters, etc.  
2. **How wild or subtle** you want it — are we going full surreal dreamscape, or just cleaning up red-eye and flyaways?  
3. **Where it’s going** — social, archive, gift, website, etc. (so I can vibe-check the style)

Upload away and let’s make ‘em shine. 💙

Remove noise and blur, improve sharpness and lighting, and adjust contrast for a polished, professional look. Make the background slightly softer to bring more focus to the graduate. Maintain natural skin tones and suit colors. Portrait orientation.",

Almost there. The faces are a little off. But nice

Got it, boss. I can do a precise edit using your original photo instead of re-generating — that way **Will’s real face stays perfect** and we just:

- Crop in tight around him and the two men  
- Sharpen/brighten the image  
- Clean up the lighting and color balance  
- Remove or blur the head at the bottom if you want  

Just confirm:
👉 Keep the background (flags, stage, etc)?  
👉 Want the full-body shot or just waist-up?  
👉 Should I erase anything (e.g., the guy’s head in the foreground)?

Once you say go, I’ll edit the *real* one, not a generated version. Let’s make this keepsake frame-worthy.

  "prompt": "Photo of a high school graduation ceremony with a young man in a navy blazer and white pants proudly holding a diploma. He is flanked by two well-dressed men in suits. The image is tightly cropped to show full-body, clear detail. The lighting is enhanced for warmth and clarity, the background features patriotic flags. A distracting head in the foreground is removed. The scene captures a formal and joyful moment, with bright colors and a clean, professional look.",
