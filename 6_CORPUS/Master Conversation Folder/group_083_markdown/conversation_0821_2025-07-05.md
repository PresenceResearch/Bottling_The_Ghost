That Dropbox link isn’t working on my end—it might’ve expired or had restricted permissions. Want to try one of the following?

1. **Re-upload the file(s)** directly here.
2. **Double-check the link** sharing settings (make sure it's set to “Anyone with the link can view”).
3. **Send a new link** from Dropbox, Google Drive, or another source if it’s part of a bigger archive.

I’ve got you either way—just say the word.
