            "Of course. Here\u2019s a New York Times\u2013style version of your introduction to Mark Manthy. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of framing it with a tone of quiet authority and understated respect\u2014clear, compelling, and just a little weepy around the edges.\n\n---\n\n**A Decade in Solar, and Still Charging Forward**\n\nMark Manthy has spent more than a decade quietly shaping the trajectory of solar energy on the East Coast, guiding projects through some of the country\u2019s most complex regulatory and urban landscapes.\n\nFrom Washington, D.C. to New York City, Mr. Manthy has developed and managed large-scale solar installations that defy logistical odds\u2014including the first commercial Community Renewable Energy Facility (CREF) ever built in the District. Today, he leads commercial development and sales at Lumina Solar, where his work spans affordable housing, nonprofit institutions, small businesses, and government entities at every level.\n\nBut Mr. Manthy\u2019s role goes far beyond the front end of development. He remains engaged from contract signing through final interconnection and system activation, anchoring Lumina\u2019s expansion into new markets through careful analysis of incentives, utilities, and evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nHis career began at Maryland-based Astrum Solar, a then-fledgling startup that grew into one of the East Coast\u2019s largest installers before its acquisition by Centrica. He holds an MBA from the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Marketing from Boston College.\n\nIn an industry known for volatility, Mr. Manthy\u2019s approach\u2014measured, collaborative, and deeply informed\u2014has proved both rare and enduring.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a second version that\u2019s more personal or more branded, perhaps for use on your website or LinkedIn?"
