Here are some key changes and trends:\n\n1. **Increased Government Support and Incentives**: Since 2009, there has been a substantial increase in government support for solar energy. This includes financial incentives such as tax credits, grants, and rebates, which have made solar investments more attractive to both individuals and businesses. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC), for example, has been a major driver in the growth of solar installations across the United States.\n\n2"

            "Since 2009, the solar market in the United States has been notably influenced by changes in presidential administrations, each bringing its own energy policies and priorities. Under the Obama administration (2009-2017), there was a strong push towards renewable energy, leading to substantial growth in the solar sector. This era saw the implementation of policies like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included significant investments in solar power. The shift to the Trump administration (2017-2021) brought some uncertainty to the sector, with a greater focus on fossil fuels and tariffs on imported solar panels, which initially raised concerns about the industry's growth. However, the resilience of the solar market and state-level commitments to renewable energy continued to drive expansion. With the Biden administration from 2021, there was a renewed federal focus on climate change and clean energy, propelling the solar industry forward with ambitious targets and supportive policies, like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the rejoining of the Paris Agreement. This changing political landscape has made the solar industry in the U.S. adaptable, resilient, and increasingly innovative."
