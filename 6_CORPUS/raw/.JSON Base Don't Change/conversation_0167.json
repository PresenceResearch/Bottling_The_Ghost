While some people complain about monotony and the lack of expressiveness in how these modern nibs write, there is one key advantage to this uniformity: interchangeability. Many, if not most, pens that accept standard JoWo or Bock nibs use a default nib unit (i.e., a nib and feed seated in a threaded housing) that can easily be unscrewed and used in another compatible pen. Once you start custom-grinding these nib units or gather the range of nib sizes, it becomes a very versatile platform that can allow you to thoroughly enjoy your pen collection. \n\n[Image 3: The process for swapping out a JoWo or Bock compatible nib unit is mostly the same between brands. Gently grasp the nib and feed and turn counter-clockwise to unscrew the unit.] \n\nThe process for swapping out a JoWo or Bock compatible nib unit is mostly the same between brands. Gently grasp the nib and feed and turn counter-clockwise to unscrew the unit. \n\nThe process itself is simple. First, if the pen you are working on is a cartridge-converter model, remove the converter. Then, gently grasp the nib and feed and turn the nib unit counter-clockwise to remove it. Select your new nib unit, insert it into the section, and rotate clockwise until secure. Do not overtighten, as this can misalign the tines of the nib, at best, and cause stress damage to the nib housing, at worst, in which case you will need a replacement. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 4: Opus 88 pens, which are Japanese-style eyedroppers, add one slight wrinkle to the process. There is a small o-ring attached to the bottom of the nib unit housing. If replacing with a non-Opus nib unit, don\u2019t forget to transfer the o-ring as well. It sits on the plastic \u201cstem\u201d and is easily removable.] \n\nOpus 88 pens, which are Japanese-style eyedroppers, add one slight wrinkle to the process. There is a small o-ring attached to the bottom of the nib unit housing. If replacing with a non-Opus nib unit, don\u2019t forget to transfer the o-ring as well. It sits on the plastic \u201cstem\u201d and is easily removable. \n\nTWSBI nib units are slightly different, though still simple. On the \u30109\u2020TWSBI Diamond 580\u3011, you simply unscrew the front section of the pen and slide the nib unit out of the plastic cover (shown here in red but clear on most current 580 models). Insert your new nib unit and reassemble. \u301010\u2020Because TWSBI sells spare nib units\u3011 for the express purpose of allowing you to easily switch nibs between pens, you don\u2019t have to worry about voiding your manufacturer\u2019s warranty or otherwise causing unintended damage. I own several spare TWSBI nibs, some of which have been custom ground to specialty nibs such as architects. \n\n\u301011\u2020 View fullsize \u2020images.squarespace-cdn.com\u3011 \n\n\u301012\u2020 View fullsize \u2020images.squarespace-cdn.com\u3011 \n\nEditor\u2019s Note: There has been a lot of press recently about a manufacturing defect that has caused cracks in JoWo nib housings. While I\u2019ve been lucky and have not yet found the issue in any of my personal pens, JoWo has released a series of announcements discussing how they plan to fix the problem. If you have been inspecting your JoWo nib units and discover cracks, \u301013\u2020please reach out to Meister Nibs, the U.S. JoWo distributor\u2020meisternibs.com\u3011. \n\n### Intermediate: Pulling and Setting Friction-Fit Nibs \n\nBut what about pens that don\u2019t use interchangeable nib units? Well, the nibs on those pens are, for the most part, equally \u201cswappable\u201d and the process is no more mechanically complex than taking a small square of rubber or other grippy material, grasping the nib and feed, and pulling both out of the front end of the pen\u2019s section using a steady motion. You replace a nib the same way, though you need to be pay attention when reinserting the nib and feed as some pens have grooves or \u201cguides\u201d that determine exactly how the nib is supposed to fit. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 5: The nibs on some pens, especially those with proprietary in-house nibs like this Platinum 3776, do not come in a housing, meaning that the nib and feed sit directly inside the custom section.] \n\nThe nibs on some pens, especially those with proprietary in-house nibs like this Platinum 3776, do not come in a housing, meaning that the nib and feed sit directly inside the custom section. \n\nSo why do I have this categorized as requiring an \u201cintermediate\u201d skill level? Honestly, it\u2019s more about confidence than skill. Sometimes, things don\u2019t go 100% as expected. Old ink residue may cause the nib and feed to get stuck in the section, and you may find yourself having to pull fairly hard or jiggle the nib a bit (gently!) to dislodge it from the pen. Any time you apply force, you run some risk of misaligning the nib tines or cracking the feed. Changing friction-fit nibs properly requires some patience, a willingness to engage in a bit of trial-and-error, and an \u201cintermediate\u201d understanding of how fountain pens work. Finally, keep in mind that if your pen breaks and you can\u2019t fix it on your own, the manufacturer might consider removing or swapping the nib on a pen without an interchangeable nib unit to be a \u201cmodification\u201d that voids your warranty. That\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t be able to find someone who can fix the pen, but you will likely have to pay for it. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 6: From the top: Platinum 3776 UEF in Schon Black Ultem, via Flexible Nib Factory JoWo housing; Pilot PO Nib in Newton Shinobi, via same housing; Platinum 3776 in an Opus 88 Jazz, via same housing.] \n\nFrom the top: \u301014\u2020Platinum 3776 UEF\u3011 in \u301015\u2020Schon Black Ultem\u2020www.schondsgn.com\u3011, via Flexible Nib Factory JoWo housing; \u301016\u2020Pilot PO Nib\u3011 in \u301017\u2020Newton Shinobi\u3011, via same housing; Platinum 3776 in an \u301018\u2020Opus 88 Jazz\u2020vanness1938.com\u3011, via same housing. \n\n### Expert: Custom Nib Housings for Maximum Pen Hacking \n\nThe last topic I plan to discuss combines the two techniques discussed above in a manner that allows you to create your own custom nib units. \u301019\u2020Flexible Nib Factory\u2020www.flexiblenib.com\u3011 sells \u301020\u2020custom nib housings\u2020flexiblenib.com\u3011 designed to pair proprietary nibs and feeds (i.e. Platinum, Pilot, Pelikan, Sailor, etc.) with JoWo and Bock-compatible pens.

While some people complain about monotony and the lack of expressiveness in how these modern nibs write, there is one key advantage to this uniformity: interchangeability. Many, if not most, pens that accept standard JoWo or Bock nibs use a default nib unit (i.e., a nib and feed seated in a threaded housing) that can easily be unscrewed and used in another compatible pen. Once you start custom-grinding these nib units or gather the range of nib sizes, it becomes a very versatile platform that can allow you to thoroughly enjoy your pen collection. \n\n[Image 3: The process for swapping out a JoWo or Bock compatible nib unit is mostly the same between brands. Gently grasp the nib and feed and turn counter-clockwise to unscrew the unit.] \n\nThe process for swapping out a JoWo or Bock compatible nib unit is mostly the same between brands. Gently grasp the nib and feed and turn counter-clockwise to unscrew the unit. \n\nThe process itself is simple. First, if the pen you are working on is a cartridge-converter model, remove the converter. Then, gently grasp the nib and feed and turn the nib unit counter-clockwise to remove it. Select your new nib unit, insert it into the section, and rotate clockwise until secure. Do not overtighten, as this can misalign the tines of the nib, at best, and cause stress damage to the nib housing, at worst, in which case you will need a replacement. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 4: Opus 88 pens, which are Japanese-style eyedroppers, add one slight wrinkle to the process. There is a small o-ring attached to the bottom of the nib unit housing. If replacing with a non-Opus nib unit, don\u2019t forget to transfer the o-ring as well.

It sits on the plastic \u201cstem\u201d and is easily removable. \n\nTWSBI nib units are slightly different, though still simple. On the \u30109\u2020TWSBI Diamond 580\u3011, you simply unscrew the front section of the pen and slide the nib unit out of the plastic cover (shown here in red but clear on most current 580 models). Insert your new nib unit and reassemble. \u301010\u2020Because TWSBI sells spare nib units\u3011 for the express purpose of allowing you to easily switch nibs between pens, you don\u2019t have to worry about voiding your manufacturer\u2019s warranty or otherwise causing unintended damage. I own several spare TWSBI nibs, some of which have been custom ground to specialty nibs such as architects. \n\n\u301011\u2020 View fullsize \u2020images.squarespace-cdn.com\u3011 \n\n\u301012\u2020 View fullsize \u2020images.squarespace-cdn.com\u3011 \n\nEditor\u2019s Note: There has been a lot of press recently about a manufacturing defect that has caused cracks in JoWo nib housings. While I\u2019ve been lucky and have not yet found the issue in any of my personal pens, JoWo has released a series of announcements discussing how they plan to fix the problem. If you have been inspecting your JoWo nib units and discover cracks, \u301013\u2020please reach out to Meister Nibs, the U.S. JoWo distributor\u2020meisternibs.com\u3011. \n\n### Intermediate: Pulling and Setting Friction-Fit Nibs \n\nBut what about pens that don\u2019t use interchangeable nib units? Well, the nibs on those pens are, for the most part, equally \u201cswappable\u201d and the process is no more mechanically complex than taking a small square of rubber or other grippy material, grasping the nib and feed, and pulling both out of the front end of the pen\u2019s section using a steady motion. You replace a nib the same way, though you need to be pay attention when reinserting the nib and feed as some pens have grooves or \u201cguides\u201d that determine exactly how the nib is supposed to fit. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 5: The nibs on some pens, especially those with proprietary in-house nibs like this Platinum 3776, do not come in a housing, meaning that the nib and feed sit directly inside the custom section.] \n\nThe nibs on some pens, especially those with proprietary in-house nibs like this Platinum 3776, do not come in a housing, meaning that the nib and feed sit directly inside the custom section. \n\nSo why do I have this categorized as requiring an \u201cintermediate\u201d skill level? Honestly, it\u2019s more about confidence than skill. Sometimes, things don\u2019t go 100% as expected. Old ink residue may cause the nib and feed to get stuck in the section, and you may find yourself having to pull fairly hard or jiggle the nib a bit (gently!) to dislodge it from the pen. Any time you apply force, you run some risk of misaligning the nib tines or cracking the feed. Changing friction-fit nibs properly requires some patience, a willingness to engage in a bit of trial-and-error, and an \u201cintermediate\u201d understanding of how fountain pens work. Finally, keep in mind that if your pen breaks and you can\u2019t fix it on your own, the manufacturer might consider removing or swapping the nib on a pen without an interchangeable nib unit to be a \u201cmodification\u201d that voids your warranty. That\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t be able to find someone who can fix the pen, but you will likely have to pay for it. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 6: From the top: Platinum 3776 UEF in Schon Black Ultem, via Flexible Nib Factory JoWo housing; Pilot PO Nib in Newton Shinobi, via same housing; Platinum 3776 in an Opus 88 Jazz, via same housing.] \n\nFrom the top: \u301014\u2020Platinum 3776 UEF\u3011 in \u301015\u2020Schon Black Ultem\u2020www.schondsgn.com\u3011, via Flexible Nib Factory JoWo housing; \u301016\u2020Pilot PO Nib\u3011 in \u301017\u2020Newton Shinobi\u3011, via same housing; Platinum 3776 in an \u301018\u2020Opus 88 Jazz\u2020vanness1938.com\u3011, via same housing. \n\n### Expert: Custom Nib Housings for Maximum Pen Hacking \n\nThe last topic I plan to discuss combines the two techniques discussed above in a manner that allows you to create your own custom nib units. \u301019\u2020Flexible Nib Factory\u2020www.flexiblenib.com\u3011 sells \u301020\u2020custom nib housings\u2020flexiblenib.com\u3011 designed to pair proprietary nibs and feeds (i.e. Platinum, Pilot, Pelikan, Sailor, etc.) with JoWo and Bock-compatible pens. For example, I pulled a friction-fit medium 14k Platinum nib from a standard Platinum 3776 fountain pen, and inserted both the nib and feed into a JoWo-compatible Flexible Nib Factory housing, which I then seated in an Opus 88 Jazz. The one drawback is that these custom housings won\u2019t accept a converter, so you will need to use a piston filler, eyedropper, or bulkfiller-style (i.e. Conid) pen. Opus 88 pens work great for these types of modifications, though with certain brands like Platinum you may have to trim the plastic end on the back of the feed in order to allow the Japanese-style eyedropper system to close. \n\nView fullsize\n\n[Image 7: A nib unit disassembled.
