Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 This webpage provides information for each project that has been provided solar capacity in the Pilot Program.\u00a0 This information has been provided by the Subscriber Organizations and is updated at least quarterly.\u00a0Items in\u00a0red\u00a0are updates from the last quarterly report.\n\nPublicly available data is provided by Excel spreadsheet.  \n\n\u00a0List of Community Solar Projects in MD with Project Details:\u00a0\u301040\u2020Public Information 2024.02.04\u3011  \n\nDescription of Data:  \n\nElectric Utility Name:\u00a0 A utility must have an approved Community Solar tariff approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission to participate in the Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 The spreadsheet has been presorted by Electric Utility Name.\n\nThe next six columns provide information concerning the solar array \n\nProject Name:\u00a0 This is the solar project name that will be used when describing the project to the public.\u00a0 It may or may not be the legal name of the project, for example \u201cSolarSun Community Solar Development Project, LLC\" may simply go by the name of \u201cSolarSun\".\n\nCommunity Solar Capacity Category:\u00a0 This column designates which category of the Community Solar Pilot Program the project has received capacity under.\u00a0 There are four official categories: Open, Small/Brownfield/Other, LMI, and Very Small.\u00a0 For ease of understanding, the Small/Brownfield/Other category may also include information designating whether the project is associated with a brownfield or with a Low and Moderate Income condition.\u00a0\n\nCommunity Solar Array Location:\u00a0 This is the location of the solar array by address or latitude/longitude as some locations do not have an address assigned yet).\n\nProject Development Status:\u00a0 This allows the viewer to determine where the project is in the development process.\u00a0 Normal responses would be Design and Development, Under Construction, In Service, Cancelled, On-hold/ Waitlist, but other status designations are also possible.\n\nProject Size:\u00a0 This column provides the project size in kilowatts of AC (alternating current) power.\u00a0 The size of the project in direct current (DC) kilowatts is likely to be 20% to 45% larger and is based on many physical and economic factors.\n\nExpected In-Service Date:\u00a0 This column provides an estimate of when the array will start producing power.\u00a0 It is not an exact date and many factors outside the control of the developer go into determining the exact date.\n\nThe next two columns provide information concerning the Subscriber Organization.\n\nSubscriber Organization Number:\u00a0 In order to develop a project in the Community Solar Pilot Program, a subscriber organization must apply for and receive a subscriber organization number from the Maryland Public Service Commission.\u00a0 As such, the number is associated with the project developer and not with the individual project itself.\n\nSubscriber Organization Name and Address:\u00a0 This column provides the public with the name and mailing address of the subscriber organization responsible for the project.\n\nThe next four columns provide information concerning subscriptions for the project.\n\nSubscriber Management Organization:\u00a0 This is the organization or organizations authorized by the Subscriber Organization to market subscriptions for the community solar project.\u00a0 Contact information is provided for each organization.\n\nSubscription Management Status:\u00a0 This informs the public if subscriptions are currently being sold.\u00a0 Normal status statements include:\u00a0 Not soliciting subscriptions at this time; Subscriptions are available; Fully subscribed, not accepting new subscriptions; and Fully subscribed, but wait-listing new requests, however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nTypes of Subscriptions Available:\u00a0 This column indicates the subscripts available to the public.\u00a0 Normal descriptors would be:\u00a0 Private Placement only, not available to the public; Available to residential subscribers only; Available to commercial subscribers only; and Available to residential or commercial subscribers; however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nSpecial LMI Discounts:\u00a0 Some projects offer special terms, conditions, or discounts to Low, or Low-and-Moderate Income subscribers.\u00a0 This column indicates if special discounts are available and may provide some details of the offer.\u00a0 Interested persons should review the entire subscription offer to understand full details of the discounts available.  \n\nThe final column indicates the date the data was last updated.\n\nFor more information concerning the Community Solar Pilot Program, please review the\u00a0\u301041\u2020Public Service Commission Community Solar

Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 This webpage provides information for each project that has been provided solar capacity in the Pilot Program.\u00a0 This information has been provided by the Subscriber Organizations and is updated at least quarterly.\u00a0Items in\u00a0red\u00a0are updates from the last quarterly report.\n\nPublicly available data is provided by Excel spreadsheet.  \n\n\u00a0List of Community Solar Projects in MD with Project Details:\u00a0\u301040\u2020Public Information 2024.02.04\u3011  \n\nDescription of Data:  \n\nElectric Utility Name:\u00a0 A utility must have an approved Community Solar tariff approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission to participate in the Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 The spreadsheet has been presorted by Electric Utility Name.\n\nThe next six columns provide information concerning the solar array \n\nProject Name:\u00a0 This is the solar project name that will be used when describing the project to the public.\u00a0 It may or may not be the legal name of the project, for example \u201cSolarSun Community Solar Development Project, LLC\" may simply go by the name of \u201cSolarSun\".\n\nCommunity Solar Capacity Category:\u00a0 This column designates which category of the Community Solar Pilot Program the project has received capacity under.\u00a0 There are four official categories: Open, Small/Brownfield/Other, LMI, and Very Small.\u00a0 For ease of understanding, the Small/Brownfield/Other category may also include information designating whether the project is associated with a brownfield or with a Low and Moderate Income condition.\u00a0\n\nCommunity Solar Array Location:\u00a0 This is the location of the solar array by address or latitude/longitude as some locations do not have an address assigned yet).\n\nProject Development Status:\u00a0 This allows the viewer to determine where the project is in the development process.\u00a0 Normal responses would be Design and Development, Under Construction, In Service, Cancelled, On-hold/ Waitlist, but other status designations are also possible.\n\nProject Size:\u00a0 This column provides the project size in kilowatts of AC (alternating current) power.\u00a0 The size of the project in direct current (DC) kilowatts is likely to be 20% to 45% larger and is based on many physical and economic factors.\n\nExpected In-Service Date:\u00a0 This column provides an estimate of when the array will start producing power.\u00a0 It is not an exact date and many factors outside the control of the developer go into determining the exact date.\n\nThe next two columns provide information concerning the Subscriber Organization.\n\nSubscriber Organization Number:\u00a0 In order to develop a project in the Community Solar Pilot Program, a subscriber organization must apply for and receive a subscriber organization number from the Maryland Public Service Commission.\u00a0 As such, the number is associated with the project developer and not with the individual project itself.\n\nSubscriber Organization Name and Address:\u00a0 This column provides the public with the name and mailing address of the subscriber organization responsible for the project.\n\nThe next four columns provide information concerning subscriptions for the project.\n\nSubscriber Management Organization:\u00a0 This is the organization or organizations authorized by the Subscriber Organization to market subscriptions for the community solar project.\u00a0 Contact information is provided for each organization.\n\nSubscription Management Status:\u00a0 This informs the public if subscriptions are currently being sold.\u00a0 Normal status statements include:\u00a0 Not soliciting subscriptions at this time; Subscriptions are available; Fully subscribed, not accepting new subscriptions; and Fully subscribed, but wait-listing new requests, however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nTypes of Subscriptions Available:\u00a0 This column indicates the subscripts available to the public.\u00a0 Normal descriptors would be:\u00a0 Private Placement only, not available to the public; Available to residential subscribers only; Available to commercial subscribers only; and Available to residential or commercial subscribers; however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nSpecial LMI Discounts:\u00a0 Some projects offer special terms, conditions, or discounts to Low, or Low-and-Moderate Income subscribers.\u00a0 This column indicates if special discounts are available and may provide some details of

In Maryland, the community solar pilot project will allow customers to buy a share of the electrical output of the community solar energy generating system. See also: \u3010148\u2020How Community Solar works\u2020energy.gov\u3011. (Source: U.S. Department of Energy)\n\nHow do I participate in a community solar pilot project?  \nYou may subscribe to a community solar project (or even more than one) that is located in the same service territory as your electric utility\u2013whether you get your electricity from the utility or a retail supplier. See your utility\u2019s website for details, or visit \u3010149\u2020EnergySage\u2020www.energysage.com\u3011 to see if there are projects near you.\n\nWhat is a subscriber organization?  \nA subscriber organization is a person or entity that owns or operates a community solar energy generating system; or the collective group of subscribers of a community solar energy generating system. We expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations. Individual subscribers are customers who buy a share of the electricity generated by a community solar energy generating system and get a credit on the bill from their utility.\n\nHow can low or moderate income customers benefit from the community solar pilot program?  \nOne category of the program is restricted for projects that must serve a significant percentage of low and moderate income customers. When you sign up for community solar, notify your subscriber organization that you are a low or moderate income customer and the subscriber organization will verify your eligibility.\n\nI am a renter \u2013 can I still take part in a community solar program?  \nYes. Participating in the program does not require you to install solar panels on your residence. You can subscribe to get your energy from a community solar project in your utility\u2019s service territory.\n\nWhat if already have rooftop solar \u2013 can I still participate?  \nYes. You can apply to a subscriber organization as long as all of your subscriptions (community solar and rooftop) do not exceed 200% of your baseline annual energy usage. Subscribed energy in excess of annual use will be paid out to customers at a rate that may be less than the subscribed cost. Customers should choose subscription levels that correspond to annual use in order to avoid loss of subscription value.\n\nHow close to the solar panels do I need to live? What happens if I move?  \nYou only need to live in the service territory served by a community solar project. If you move within that same territory you can transfer your subscription to your new residence. Subject to the terms and conditions of your contract, you may be able to transfer your subscription to another eligible customer.\n\nHow do bill credits work for the community solar program?  \nBill credits will vary depending on your subscription contract (refer to your contract for specific terms and conditions). You will get a bill credit based on the amount of electricity produced by your share of the project. A utility may choose to apply the kilowatt-hour credit to each subscriber\u2019s bill as either a reduction in kilowatt-hour use OR a dollar credit to the subscriber\u2019s billed amount.\n\nDoes this program have consumer protection policies?  \nAs with any business deal, READ YOUR CONTRACT CAREFULLY and make sure you understand and agree with the terms and conditions before you sign. There are a number of consumer protections:\n\n  * Subscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive.\n  * Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities.\n  * In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed. The PSC does not regulate community solar rates.\n\nThe pilot program period is for seven years\u2014what happens after that?  \nWhile no new projects will be accepted into the program after the end of the seven-year period, a subscriber organization can continue to operate a community solar project that was established during the program until September 30, 2044 or 25 years after the organization has been authorized to operate \u2014 whichever comes later.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions for Developers/Subscriber Organizations\n\nWhat are the program categories and capacity limits?  \nSee the charts below for the program categories and capacity limits\u2013both in total and by utility service territory.  \n[Image 9]  \nWho can participate as a subscriber organization?  \nWe expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations.\n\nHow do subscriber organizations apply to participate?  \nA subscriber organization (which can be a utility, retail electricity supplier, solar developer, etc.) must first be granted admission to the program by the Commission\u2013the application form can be found \u3010151\u2020here\u3011. After receiving an ID number, the subscriber organization must then apply to the electric company serving the location of the project. The capacity of each project must not exceed 2 MW.\n\nLinks to utility community solar programs and interconnection applications:\n\n  * \u3010152\u2020BGE Community Solar Pilot Program\u2020www.bge.com\u3011\n  * \u3010153\u2020Delmarva Power & Light Green Power Connection\u2020www.delmarva.com\u3011\n  * \u3010154\u2020Potomac Edison Company (MD) Community Solar\u2020www.firstenergycorp.com\u3011\n  * \u3010155\u2020Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) Green Power Connection\u2020www.pepco.com\u3011\n\nCan existing solar generating systems be part of the pilot program?  \nA subscriber organization may apply to convert all or a portion of an existing solar generating system of 500 kw or less to the community solar program\u2014if that system began operating before May 15, 2016. After the end of the first year of the community solar pilot program, if a service territory has less than 5 MW of program capacity, existing projects up to 2 MW may apply to the community solar program.\n\nAre there restrictions on where community solar projects can be located?  \nUnder this pilot program, multiple community solar projects owned by the same entity or affiliate cannot be located on the same or adjacent properties unless they are:\n\n  * On the rooftops of buildings\n  * In areas zoned for industrial use\n  * On a brownfield (but with a combined capacity not exceeding 6 MW)\n  * Over parking lots of roadways, or\n  * On a multi-level parking structure.\n\nWhat are the consumer protection policies that subscriber organizations must follow?  \nSubscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive. Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities. In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed.

In Maryland, the community solar pilot project will allow customers to buy a share of the electrical output of the community solar energy generating system. See also: \u3010148\u2020How Community Solar works\u2020energy.gov\u3011. (Source: U.S. Department of Energy)\n\nHow do I participate in a community solar pilot project?  \nYou may subscribe to a community solar project (or even more than one) that is located in the same service territory as your electric utility\u2013whether you get your electricity from the utility or a retail supplier. See your utility\u2019s website for details, or visit \u3010149\u2020EnergySage\u2020www.energysage.com\u3011 to see if there are projects near you.\n\nWhat is a subscriber organization?  \nA subscriber organization is a person or entity that owns or operates a community solar energy generating system; or the collective group of subscribers of a community solar energy generating system. We expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations. Individual subscribers are customers who buy a share of the electricity generated by a community solar energy generating system and get a credit on the bill from their utility.\n\nHow can low or moderate income customers benefit from the community solar pilot program?  \nOne category of the program is restricted for projects that must serve a significant percentage of low and moderate income customers. When you sign up for community solar, notify your subscriber organization that you are a low or moderate income customer and the subscriber organization will verify your eligibility.\n\nI am a renter \u2013 can I still take part in a community solar program?  \nYes. Participating in the program does not require you to install solar panels on your residence. You can subscribe to get your energy from a community solar project in your utility\u2019s service territory.\n\nWhat if already have rooftop solar \u2013 can I still participate?  \nYes. You can apply to a subscriber organization as long as all of your subscriptions (community solar and rooftop) do not exceed 200% of your baseline annual energy usage. Subscribed energy in excess of annual use will be paid out to customers at a rate that may be less than the subscribed cost. Customers should choose subscription levels that correspond to annual use in order to avoid loss of subscription value.\n\nHow close to the solar panels do I need to live? What happens if I move?  \nYou only need to live in the service territory served by a community solar project. If you move within that same territory you can transfer your subscription to your new residence. Subject to the terms and conditions of your contract, you may be able to transfer your subscription to another eligible customer.\n\nHow do bill credits work for the community solar program?  \nBill credits will vary depending on your subscription contract (refer to your contract for specific terms and conditions). You will get a bill credit based on the amount of electricity produced by your share of the project. A utility may choose to apply the kilowatt-hour credit to each subscriber\u2019s bill as either a reduction in kilowatt-hour use OR a dollar credit to the subscriber\u2019s billed amount.\n\nDoes this program have consumer protection policies?  \nAs with any business deal, READ YOUR CONTRACT CAREFULLY and make sure you understand and agree with the terms and conditions before you sign. There are a number of consumer protections:\n\n  * Subscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive.\n  * Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities.\n  * In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed. The PSC does not regulate community solar rates.\n\nThe pilot program period is for seven years\u2014what happens after that?  \nWhile no new projects will be accepted into the program after the end of the seven-year period, a subscriber organization can continue to operate a community solar project that was established during the program until September 30, 2044 or 25 years after the organization has been authorized to operate \u2014 whichever comes later.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions for Developers/Subscriber Organizations\n\nWhat are the program categories and capacity limits?  \nSee the charts below for the program categories and capacity limits\u2013both in total and by utility service territory.  \n[Image 9]  \nWho can participate as a subscriber organization?  \nWe expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations.\n\nHow do subscriber organizations apply to participate?  \nA subscriber organization (which can be a utility, retail electricity supplier, solar developer, etc.) must first be granted admission to the program by the Commission\u2013the application form can be found \u3010151\u2020here\u3011.

Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 This webpage provides information for each project that has been provided solar capacity in the Pilot Program.\u00a0 This information has been provided by the Subscriber Organizations and is updated at least quarterly.\u00a0Items in\u00a0red\u00a0are updates from the last quarterly report.\n\nPublicly available data is provided by Excel spreadsheet.  \n\n\u00a0List of Community Solar Projects in MD with Project Details:\u00a0\u301040\u2020Public Information 2024.02.04\u3011  \n\nDescription of Data:  \n\nElectric Utility Name:\u00a0 A utility must have an approved Community Solar tariff approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission to participate in the Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 The spreadsheet has been presorted by Electric Utility Name.\n\nThe next six columns provide information concerning the solar array \n\nProject Name:\u00a0 This is the solar project name that will be used when describing the project to the public.\u00a0 It may or may not be the legal name of the project, for example \u201cSolarSun Community Solar Development Project, LLC\" may simply go by the name of \u201cSolarSun\".\n\nCommunity Solar Capacity Category:\u00a0 This column designates which category of the Community Solar Pilot Program the project has received capacity under.\u00a0 There are four official categories: Open, Small/Brownfield/Other, LMI, and Very Small.\u00a0 For ease of understanding, the Small/Brownfield/Other category may also include information designating whether the project is associated with a brownfield or with a Low and Moderate Income condition.\u00a0\n\nCommunity Solar Array Location:\u00a0 This is the location of the solar array by address or latitude/longitude as some locations do not have an address assigned yet).\n\nProject Development Status:\u00a0 This allows the viewer to determine where the project is in the development process.\u00a0 Normal responses would be Design and Development, Under Construction, In Service, Cancelled, On-hold/ Waitlist, but other status designations are also possible.\n\nProject Size:\u00a0 This column provides the project size in kilowatts of AC (alternating current) power.\u00a0 The size of the project in direct current (DC) kilowatts is likely to be 20% to 45% larger and is based on many physical and economic factors.\n\nExpected In-Service Date:\u00a0 This column provides an estimate of when the array will start producing power.\u00a0 It is not an exact date and many factors outside the control of the developer go into determining the exact date.\n\nThe next two columns provide information concerning the Subscriber Organization.\n\nSubscriber Organization Number:\u00a0 In order to develop a project in the Community Solar Pilot Program, a subscriber organization must apply for and receive a subscriber organization number from the Maryland Public Service Commission.\u00a0 As such, the number is associated with the project developer and not with the individual project itself.\n\nSubscriber Organization Name and Address:\u00a0 This column provides the public with the name and mailing address of the subscriber organization responsible for the project.\n\nThe next four columns provide information concerning subscriptions for the project.\n\nSubscriber Management Organization:\u00a0 This is the organization or organizations authorized by the Subscriber Organization to market subscriptions for the community solar project.\u00a0 Contact information is provided for each organization.\n\nSubscription Management Status:\u00a0 This informs the public if subscriptions are currently being sold.\u00a0 Normal status statements include:\u00a0 Not soliciting subscriptions at this time; Subscriptions are available; Fully subscribed, not accepting new subscriptions; and Fully subscribed, but wait-listing new requests, however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nTypes of Subscriptions Available:\u00a0 This column indicates the subscripts available to the public.\u00a0 Normal descriptors would be:\u00a0 Private Placement only, not available to the public; Available to residential subscribers only; Available to commercial subscribers only; and Available to residential or commercial subscribers; however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nSpecial LMI Discounts:\u00a0 Some projects offer special terms, conditions, or discounts to Low, or Low-and-Moderate Income subscribers.\u00a0 This column indicates if special discounts are available and may provide some details of the offer.\u00a0 Interested persons should review the entire subscription offer to understand full details of the discounts available.  \n\nThe final column indicates the date the data was last updated.\n\nFor more information concerning the Community Solar Pilot Program, please review the\u00a0\u301041\u2020Public Service Commission Community Solar

In Maryland, the community solar pilot project will allow customers to buy a share of the electrical output of the community solar energy generating system. See also: \u3010148\u2020How Community Solar works\u2020energy.gov\u3011. (Source: U.S. Department of Energy)\n\nHow do I participate in a community solar pilot project?  \nYou may subscribe to a community solar project (or even more than one) that is located in the same service territory as your electric utility\u2013whether you get your electricity from the utility or a retail supplier. See your utility\u2019s website for details, or visit \u3010149\u2020EnergySage\u2020www.energysage.com\u3011 to see if there are projects near you.\n\nWhat is a subscriber organization?  \nA subscriber organization is a person or entity that owns or operates a community solar energy generating system; or the collective group of subscribers of a community solar energy generating system. We expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations. Individual subscribers are customers who buy a share of the electricity generated by a community solar energy generating system and get a credit on the bill from their utility.\n\nHow can low or moderate income customers benefit from the community solar pilot program?  \nOne category of the program is restricted for projects that must serve a significant percentage of low and moderate income customers. When you sign up for community solar, notify your subscriber organization that you are a low or moderate income customer and the subscriber organization will verify your eligibility.\n\nI am a renter \u2013 can I still take part in a community solar program?  \nYes. Participating in the program does not require you to install solar panels on your residence. You can subscribe to get your energy from a community solar project in your utility\u2019s service territory.\n\nWhat if already have rooftop solar \u2013 can I still participate?  \nYes. You can apply to a subscriber organization as long as all of your subscriptions (community solar and rooftop) do not exceed 200% of your baseline annual energy usage. Subscribed energy in excess of annual use will be paid out to customers at a rate that may be less than the subscribed cost. Customers should choose subscription levels that correspond to annual use in order to avoid loss of subscription value.\n\nHow close to the solar panels do I need to live? What happens if I move?  \nYou only need to live in the service territory served by a community solar project. If you move within that same territory you can transfer your subscription to your new residence. Subject to the terms and conditions of your contract, you may be able to transfer your subscription to another eligible customer.\n\nHow do bill credits work for the community solar program?  \nBill credits will vary depending on your subscription contract (refer to your contract for specific terms and conditions). You will get a bill credit based on the amount of electricity produced by your share of the project. A utility may choose to apply the kilowatt-hour credit to each subscriber\u2019s bill as either a reduction in kilowatt-hour use OR a dollar credit to the subscriber\u2019s billed amount.\n\nDoes this program have consumer protection policies?  \nAs with any business deal, READ YOUR CONTRACT CAREFULLY and make sure you understand and agree with the terms and conditions before you sign. There are a number of consumer protections:\n\n  * Subscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive.\n  * Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities.\n  * In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed. The PSC does not regulate community solar rates.\n\nThe pilot program period is for seven years\u2014what happens after that?  \nWhile no new projects will be accepted into the program after the end of the seven-year period, a subscriber organization can continue to operate a community solar project that was established during the program until September 30, 2044 or 25 years after the organization has been authorized to operate \u2014 whichever comes later.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions for Developers/Subscriber Organizations\n\nWhat are the program categories and capacity limits?  \nSee the charts below for the program categories and capacity limits\u2013both in total and by utility service territory.  \n[Image 9]  \nWho can participate as a subscriber organization?  \nWe expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations.\n\nHow do subscriber organizations apply to participate?  \nA subscriber organization (which can be a utility, retail electricity supplier, solar developer, etc.) must first be granted admission to the program by the Commission\u2013the application form can be found \u3010151\u2020here\u3011. After receiving an ID number, the subscriber organization must then apply to the electric company serving the location of the project. The capacity of each project must not exceed 2 MW.\n\nLinks to utility community solar programs and interconnection applications:\n\n  * \u3010152\u2020BGE Community Solar Pilot Program\u2020www.bge.com\u3011\n  * \u3010153\u2020Delmarva Power & Light Green Power Connection\u2020www.delmarva.com\u3011\n  * \u3010154\u2020Potomac Edison Company (MD) Community Solar\u2020www.firstenergycorp.com\u3011\n  * \u3010155\u2020Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) Green Power Connection\u2020www.pepco.com\u3011\n\nCan existing solar generating systems be part of the pilot program?  \nA subscriber organization may apply to convert all or a portion of an existing solar generating system of 500 kw or less to the community solar program\u2014if that system began operating before May 15, 2016. After the end of the first year of the community solar pilot program, if a service territory has less than 5 MW of program capacity, existing projects up to 2 MW may apply to the community solar program.\n\nAre there restrictions on where community solar projects can be located?  \nUnder this pilot program, multiple community solar projects owned by the same entity or affiliate cannot be located on the same or adjacent properties unless they are:\n\n  * On the rooftops of buildings\n  * In areas zoned for industrial use\n  * On a brownfield (but with a combined capacity not exceeding 6 MW)\n  * Over parking lots of roadways, or\n  * On a multi-level parking structure.\n\nWhat are the consumer protection policies that subscriber organizations must follow?  \nSubscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive. Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities. In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed. The PSC does not regulate community solar rates.\n\nThe pilot program period is for seven years\u2014what happens after that?  \nWhile no new projects will be accepted into the program after the end of the seven-year period, a subscriber organization can continue to operate a community solar project that was established during the program until September 30, 2044 or 25 years after organization has been authorized to operate \u2013 whichever comes later.\n\n  * \u30104\u2020Electricity\u3011 \n    * \u30105\u2020The Electricity Division\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020CPCN Information\u3011 \n      * \u30107\u2020CPCN Exemption Application Form\u3011\n      * \u30108\u2020CPCN Exemptions\u3011\n    * \u30109\u2020Electric Choice\u3011 \n      * \u301010\u2020Electricity Supplier List\u2020www.mdelectricchoice.com\u3011\n      * \u301011\u2020Electric Choice: Monthly Enrollment Reports\u3011\n      * \u301012\u2020Electric Supplier Application\u3011\n      * \u301013\u2020Shop for Electricity\u2020www.mdelectricchoice.com\u3011\n    * \u301014\u2020Working-Groups\u3011\n    * \u301015\u2020Energy Efficiency & EmPOWER Maryland\u3011\n    * \u301016\u2020EN-6: Utility Accident Notification & Investigation Form\u3011\n    * \u301017\u2020Electric Utility Tariffs\u3011\n    * \u301018\u2020Meter and Submeter Shops\u3011 \n      * \u301019\u2020Approved Electric Meter Shops\u3011",

Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 This webpage provides information for each project that has been provided solar capacity in the Pilot Program.\u00a0 This information has been provided by the Subscriber Organizations and is updated at least quarterly.\u00a0Items in\u00a0red\u00a0are updates from the last quarterly report.\n\nPublicly available data is provided by Excel spreadsheet.  \n\n\u00a0List of Community Solar Projects in MD with Project Details:\u00a0\u301040\u2020Public Information 2024.02.04\u3011  \n\nDescription of Data:  \n\nElectric Utility Name:\u00a0 A utility must have an approved Community Solar tariff approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission to participate in the Community Solar Pilot Program.\u00a0 The spreadsheet has been presorted by Electric Utility Name.\n\nThe next six columns provide information concerning the solar array \n\nProject Name:\u00a0 This is the solar project name that will be used when describing the project to the public.\u00a0 It may or may not be the legal name of the project, for example \u201cSolarSun Community Solar Development Project, LLC\" may simply go by the name of \u201cSolarSun\".\n\nCommunity Solar Capacity Category:\u00a0 This column designates which category of the Community Solar Pilot Program the project has received capacity under.\u00a0 There are four official categories: Open, Small/Brownfield/Other, LMI, and Very Small.\u00a0 For ease of understanding, the Small/Brownfield/Other category may also include information designating whether the project is associated with a brownfield or with a Low and Moderate Income condition.\u00a0\n\nCommunity Solar Array Location:\u00a0 This is the location of the solar array by address or latitude/longitude as some locations do not have an address assigned yet).\n\nProject Development Status:\u00a0 This allows the viewer to determine where the project is in the development process.\u00a0 Normal responses would be Design and Development, Under Construction, In Service, Cancelled, On-hold/ Waitlist, but other status designations are also possible.\n\nProject Size:\u00a0 This column provides the project size in kilowatts of AC (alternating current) power.\u00a0 The size of the project in direct current (DC) kilowatts is likely to be 20% to 45% larger and is based on many physical and economic factors.\n\nExpected In-Service Date:\u00a0 This column provides an estimate of when the array will start producing power.\u00a0 It is not an exact date and many factors outside the control of the developer go into determining the exact date.\n\nThe next two columns provide information concerning the Subscriber Organization.\n\nSubscriber Organization Number:\u00a0 In order to develop a project in the Community Solar Pilot Program, a subscriber organization must apply for and receive a subscriber organization number from the Maryland Public Service Commission.\u00a0 As such, the number is associated with the project developer and not with the individual project itself.\n\nSubscriber Organization Name and Address:\u00a0 This column provides the public with the name and mailing address of the subscriber organization responsible for the project.\n\nThe next four columns provide information concerning subscriptions for the project.\n\nSubscriber Management Organization:\u00a0 This is the organization or organizations authorized by the Subscriber Organization to market subscriptions for the community solar project.\u00a0 Contact information is provided for each organization.\n\nSubscription Management Status:\u00a0 This informs the public if subscriptions are currently being sold.\u00a0 Normal status statements include:\u00a0 Not soliciting subscriptions at this time; Subscriptions are available; Fully subscribed, not accepting new subscriptions; and Fully subscribed, but wait-listing new requests, however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nTypes of Subscriptions Available:\u00a0 This column indicates the subscripts available to the public.\u00a0 Normal descriptors would be:\u00a0 Private Placement only, not available to the public; Available to residential subscribers only; Available to commercial subscribers only; and Available to residential or commercial subscribers; however other descriptors are also possible.\n\nSpecial LMI Discounts:\u00a0 Some projects offer special terms, conditions, or discounts to Low, or Low-and-Moderate Income subscribers.\u00a0 This column indicates if special discounts are available and may provide some details of the offer.\u00a0 Interested persons should review the entire subscription offer to understand full details of the discounts available.  \n\nThe final column indicates the date the data was last updated.\n\nFor more information concerning the Community Solar Pilot Program, please review the\u00a0\u301041\u2020Public Service Commission Community Solar

In Maryland, the community solar pilot project will allow customers to buy a share of the electrical output of the community solar energy generating system. See also: \u3010148\u2020How Community Solar works\u2020energy.gov\u3011. (Source: U.S. Department of Energy)\n\nHow do I participate in a community solar pilot project?  \nYou may subscribe to a community solar project (or even more than one) that is located in the same service territory as your electric utility\u2013whether you get your electricity from the utility or a retail supplier. See your utility\u2019s website for details, or visit \u3010149\u2020EnergySage\u2020www.energysage.com\u3011 to see if there are projects near you.\n\nWhat is a subscriber organization?  \nA subscriber organization is a person or entity that owns or operates a community solar energy generating system; or the collective group of subscribers of a community solar energy generating system. We expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations. Individual subscribers are customers who buy a share of the electricity generated by a community solar energy generating system and get a credit on the bill from their utility.\n\nHow can low or moderate income customers benefit from the community solar pilot program?  \nOne category of the program is restricted for projects that must serve a significant percentage of low and moderate income customers. When you sign up for community solar, notify your subscriber organization that you are a low or moderate income customer and the subscriber organization will verify your eligibility.\n\nI am a renter \u2013 can I still take part in a community solar program?  \nYes. Participating in the program does not require you to install solar panels on your residence. You can subscribe to get your energy from a community solar project in your utility\u2019s service territory.\n\nWhat if already have rooftop solar \u2013 can I still participate?  \nYes. You can apply to a subscriber organization as long as all of your subscriptions (community solar and rooftop) do not exceed 200% of your baseline annual energy usage. Subscribed energy in excess of annual use will be paid out to customers at a rate that may be less than the subscribed cost. Customers should choose subscription levels that correspond to annual use in order to avoid loss of subscription value.\n\nHow close to the solar panels do I need to live? What happens if I move?  \nYou only need to live in the service territory served by a community solar project. If you move within that same territory you can transfer your subscription to your new residence. Subject to the terms and conditions of your contract, you may be able to transfer your subscription to another eligible customer.\n\nHow do bill credits work for the community solar program?  \nBill credits will vary depending on your subscription contract (refer to your contract for specific terms and conditions). You will get a bill credit based on the amount of electricity produced by your share of the project. A utility may choose to apply the kilowatt-hour credit to each subscriber\u2019s bill as either a reduction in kilowatt-hour use OR a dollar credit to the subscriber\u2019s billed amount.\n\nDoes this program have consumer protection policies?  \nAs with any business deal, READ YOUR CONTRACT CAREFULLY and make sure you understand and agree with the terms and conditions before you sign. There are a number of consumer protections:\n\n  * Subscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive.\n  * Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities.\n  * In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed. The PSC does not regulate community solar rates.\n\nThe pilot program period is for seven years\u2014what happens after that?  \nWhile no new projects will be accepted into the program after the end of the seven-year period, a subscriber organization can continue to operate a community solar project that was established during the program until September 30, 2044 or 25 years after the organization has been authorized to operate \u2014 whichever comes later.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions for Developers/Subscriber Organizations\n\nWhat are the program categories and capacity limits?  \nSee the charts below for the program categories and capacity limits\u2013both in total and by utility service territory.  \n[Image 9]  \nWho can participate as a subscriber organization?  \nWe expect solar developers, non-profit energy assistance groups, homeowners associations, community organizations, commercial businesses, utilities, retail electricity suppliers, etc., to consider applying to participate in the community solar program as subscriber organizations.\n\nHow do subscriber organizations apply to participate?  \nA subscriber organization (which can be a utility, retail electricity supplier, solar developer, etc.) must first be granted admission to the program by the Commission\u2013the application form can be found \u3010151\u2020here\u3011. After receiving an ID number, the subscriber organization must then apply to the electric company serving the location of the project. The capacity of each project must not exceed 2 MW.\n\nLinks to utility community solar programs and interconnection applications:\n\n  * \u3010152\u2020BGE Community Solar Pilot Program\u2020www.bge.com\u3011\n  * \u3010153\u2020Delmarva Power & Light Green Power Connection\u2020www.delmarva.com\u3011\n  * \u3010154\u2020Potomac Edison Company (MD) Community Solar\u2020www.firstenergycorp.com\u3011\n  * \u3010155\u2020Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) Green Power Connection\u2020www.pepco.com\u3011\n\nCan existing solar generating systems be part of the pilot program?  \nA subscriber organization may apply to convert all or a portion of an existing solar generating system of 500 kw or less to the community solar program\u2014if that system began operating before May 15, 2016. After the end of the first year of the community solar pilot program, if a service territory has less than 5 MW of program capacity, existing projects up to 2 MW may apply to the community solar program.\n\nAre there restrictions on where community solar projects can be located?  \nUnder this pilot program, multiple community solar projects owned by the same entity or affiliate cannot be located on the same or adjacent properties unless they are:\n\n  * On the rooftops of buildings\n  * In areas zoned for industrial use\n  * On a brownfield (but with a combined capacity not exceeding 6 MW)\n  * Over parking lots of roadways, or\n  * On a multi-level parking structure.\n\nWhat are the consumer protection policies that subscriber organizations must follow?  \nSubscriber organizations are not allowed to use marketing tactics that are unfair, false, misleading or deceptive. Agents may not market door-to-door unless they have had a criminal background check and have been properly trained in local, state and federal laws governing marketing activities. In addition, there are minimum requirements for a subscription contract as well as a \u3010150\u2020contract disclosure form\u3011 that must be presented to every subscriber before a contract is signed. The PSC does not regulate community solar rates.\n\nThe pilot program period is for seven years\u2014what happens after that?  \nWhile no new projects will be accepted into the program after the end of the seven-year period, a subscriber organization can continue to operate a community solar project that was established during the program until September 30, 2044 or 25 years after organization has been authorized to operate \u2013 whichever comes later.\n\n  * \u30104\u2020Electricity\u3011 \n    * \u30105\u2020The Electricity Division\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020CPCN Information\u3011 \n      * \u30107\u2020CPCN Exemption Application Form\u3011\n      * \u30108\u2020CPCN Exemptions\u3011\n    * \u30109\u2020Electric Choice\u3011 \n      * \u301010\u2020Electricity Supplier List\u2020www.mdelectricchoice.com\u3011\n      * \u301011\u2020Electric Choice: Monthly Enrollment Reports\u3011\n      * \u301012\u2020Electric Supplier Application\u3011\n      * \u301013\u2020Shop for Electricity\u2020www.mdelectricchoice.com\u3011\n    * \u301014\u2020Working-Groups\u3011\n    * \u301015\u2020Energy Efficiency & EmPOWER Maryland\u3011\n    * \u301016\u2020EN-6: Utility Accident Notification & Investigation Form\u3011\n    * \u301017\u2020Electric Utility Tariffs\u3011\n    * \u301018\u2020Meter and Submeter Shops\u3011 \n      * \u301019\u2020Approved Electric Meter Shops\u3011",
