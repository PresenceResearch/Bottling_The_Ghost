These developments are exciting and beneficial to homeowners, installers, and developers throughout Maryland.\n\nTo compare all the RPS and SACP changes in Maryland, please refer to the table below.\n\nYear Old Solar Carve-Out New Solar Carve-Out Old Tier I Requirement New Tier I Requirement Old SACP  New SACP Tier I ACP (Unchanged)  \n2021 7.5% n/a 30.8% n/a $80.00 n/a $30.00  \n2022 8.5% 5.5% 33.1% 30.1% $60.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2023 9.5% 6.0% 35.4% 31.9% $45.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2024 10.5% 6.5% 37.7% 33.7% $40.00 $60.00 $27.50  \n2025 11.5% 7.0% 40.0% 35.5% $35.00 $55.00 $25.00  \n2026 12.5% 8.0% 42.5% 38.0% $30.00 $45.00 $24.75  \n2027 13.5% 9.5% 45.5% 41.5% $25.00 $35.00 $24.50  \n2028 14.5% 11.0% 47.5% 43.0% $22.50 $32.50 $22.50  \n2029 14.5% 12.5% 49.5% 47.5% $22.50 $25.00 $22.50  \n2030+ 14.5% 14.5% 50% 50.0% $22.50 $22.25 $22.35  \n\n* * *\n\n### Recent Articles...\n\nInsights | 20 May 2024 \n\n\u301021\u2020Good Intentions, Bad Policy, and the Threat to the Clean Energy Transition\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 20 Mar 2024 \n\n\u301022\u2020From Vision to Impact: Sol Systems\u2019 Journey Towards a Community-Focused Clean Energy Economy\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 28 Nov 2023 \n\n\u301023\u2020DC Greens: Building Impact Through a Sustainable and Resilient Food System\u3011 \n\n### Explore sustainable energy solutions with Sol Systems\n\n\u30103\u2020WHO WE SERVE\u3011\n\n\u30102\u2020WHAT WE DO\u3011\n\nLooking for something else?  \nEmail: info@solsystems.com \n\nSol Systems \n\nSol Systems is a leading, national solar energy firm with an established reputation for integrity and reliability across its distinct and complementary businesses.

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

Currently, homeowners with systems installed after 07/01/24 will begin generating Certified SRECs on 01/01/2025, which are expected to be worth around 1.5x the current Legacy MD SRECs. Homeowners in Maryland who are interested in the possibility of installing solar will benefit massively from these higher priced SRECs, and can enjoy the benefit of incentives like the Federal Investment Tax Credit and the MD FY2025 Solar Access Program, which is designed to provide grant money for low to moderate income residents.\u00a0\n\nFlett Exchange has also released a free to use solar installation financial model. We suggest using this model to fully realize the advantages and long term cash flows of a solar investment before having a conversation with a solar installer. Flett Exchange is a neutral third party that does not profit off of the installation of a solar array; we simply broker SRECs produced by homeowners. This affords us the unique position to offer unbiased, informative, and realistic forecasts and consulting on solar investments. If you are interested in potentially going solar, contact Flett Exchange for a zero cost consultation service and we can help match you with a solar installation company. The goal of Flett Exchange, ultimately, is to broker more SREC deals; we are not involved in any capacity with the process of installing solar arrays. It is our hope that this complementary service will steer you in our direction to sell your SRECs post installation.\u00a0\n\n\u301032\u2020MD Solar PV Installation Cash Flow Model\u2020www.flettexchange.com\u3011\n\nListed below are some key assumptions of the model:\u00a0\n\n  * The Maryland Energy Administration will provide grants of $750/kW\u00a0 with a $7,500 cap to low to middle income homeowners for installation of a residential solar system\n\n  * The Maryland utility bill inflation rate is 2.83% annually. This number is derived from the average utility bill from 2014-2023 for five major state power companies: Delmarva Power, PEPCO, SMECO, BGE, and Potomac Edison.\u00a0\n\n  * A residential solar installation will yield positive cash flow from SREC income, as well as an implied positive cash flow from avoided utility costs\n\n  * The SACP set by the Maryland RPS will decrease incrementally as expected, and this benchmark will serve as a proxy for yearly SREC prices throughout the life of the system\u00a0\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\u301035\u2020SREC\u3011\u301036\u2020Research\u3011\u301037\u2020Maryland Certified\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301022\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30102\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Calculators\n\n  * \u30101\u2020Maryland Solar Installation Financial Model\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301011\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301029\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Maryland Certified SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Maryland GREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30103\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u301010\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30108\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301026\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301040\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301041\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u301046\u2020Disclaimer\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020User Agreement\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Auction Rules\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Fee Schedule",

Currently, homeowners with systems installed after 07/01/24 will begin generating Certified SRECs on 01/01/2025, which are expected to be worth around 1.5x the current Legacy MD SRECs. Homeowners in Maryland who are interested in the possibility of installing solar will benefit massively from these higher priced SRECs, and can enjoy the benefit of incentives like the Federal Investment Tax Credit and the MD FY2025 Solar Access Program, which is designed to provide grant money for low to moderate income residents.\u00a0\n\nFlett Exchange has also released a free to use solar installation financial model. We suggest using this model to fully realize the advantages and long term cash flows of a solar investment before having a conversation with a solar installer. Flett Exchange is a neutral third party that does not profit off of the installation of a solar array; we simply broker SRECs produced by homeowners. This affords us the unique position to offer unbiased, informative, and realistic forecasts and consulting on solar investments. If you are interested in potentially going solar, contact Flett Exchange for a zero cost consultation service and we can help match you with a solar installation company. The goal of Flett Exchange, ultimately, is to broker more SREC deals; we are not involved in any capacity with the process of installing solar arrays. It is our hope that this complementary service will steer you in our direction to sell your SRECs post installation.\u00a0\n\n\u301032\u2020MD Solar PV Installation Cash Flow Model\u2020www.flettexchange.com\u3011\n\nListed below are some key assumptions of the model:\u00a0\n\n  * The Maryland Energy Administration will provide grants of $750/kW\u00a0 with a $7,500 cap to low to middle income homeowners for installation of a residential solar system\n\n  * The Maryland utility bill inflation rate is 2.83% annually. This number is derived from the average utility bill from 2014-2023 for five major state power companies: Delmarva Power, PEPCO, SMECO, BGE, and Potomac Edison.\u00a0\n\n  * A residential solar installation will yield positive cash flow from SREC income, as well as an implied positive cash flow from avoided utility costs\n\n  * The SACP set by the Maryland RPS will decrease incrementally as expected, and this benchmark will serve as a proxy for yearly SREC prices throughout the life of the system\u00a0\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\u301035\u2020SREC\u3011\u301036\u2020Research\u3011\u301037\u2020Maryland Certified\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301022\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30102\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Calculators\n\n  * \u30101\u2020Maryland Solar Installation Financial Model\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301011\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301029\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Maryland Certified SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Maryland GREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30103\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u301010\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30108\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301026\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301040\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301041\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u301046\u2020Disclaimer\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020User Agreement\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Auction Rules\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Fee Schedule",

            "As of July 1, 2024, the adjusted value for Maryland Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) reflects significant legislative changes. Systems installed after this date will generate what are termed \"Certified SRECs,\" which can satisfy 150% of a utility's compliance requirement. This implies a premium value compared to legacy SRECs.\n\n### Key Details:\n1. **Maryland Certified SREC Market Launch**: Systems installed after July 1, 2024, will begin producing Certified SRECs starting January 1, 2025. These SRECs will initially be priced at approximately 1.5 times the legacy SREC value\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n   \n2. **SREC Prices and Premiums**: \n   - For 2025, Certified SRECs are expected to have an implied SACP (Solar Alternative Compliance Payment) of $82.50, with an estimated premium of $27.50 above the regular SACP of $55\u301011\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n   - This premium reflects the increased value utilities derive from using Certified SRECs to meet a larger portion of their compliance obligations.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: \n   - The Maryland Solar Bill (HB1435/SB0737) introduced these changes to boost solar adoption by providing more incentives through higher SREC values and extended SREC lifespan from three to five years\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n   - New installations on rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites are particularly incentivized\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can review the sources from Sol Systems and Flett Exchange, which provide insights into these legislative updates and their implications for SREC markets\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011."

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

Currently, homeowners with systems installed after 07/01/24 will begin generating Certified SRECs on 01/01/2025, which are expected to be worth around 1.5x the current Legacy MD SRECs. Homeowners in Maryland who are interested in the possibility of installing solar will benefit massively from these higher priced SRECs, and can enjoy the benefit of incentives like the Federal Investment Tax Credit and the MD FY2025 Solar Access Program, which is designed to provide grant money for low to moderate income residents.\u00a0\n\nFlett Exchange has also released a free to use solar installation financial model. We suggest using this model to fully realize the advantages and long term cash flows of a solar investment before having a conversation with a solar installer. Flett Exchange is a neutral third party that does not profit off of the installation of a solar array; we simply broker SRECs produced by homeowners. This affords us the unique position to offer unbiased, informative, and realistic forecasts and consulting on solar investments. If you are interested in potentially going solar, contact Flett Exchange for a zero cost consultation service and we can help match you with a solar installation company. The goal of Flett Exchange, ultimately, is to broker more SREC deals; we are not involved in any capacity with the process of installing solar arrays. It is our hope that this complementary service will steer you in our direction to sell your SRECs post installation.\u00a0\n\n\u301032\u2020MD Solar PV Installation Cash Flow Model\u2020www.flettexchange.com\u3011\n\nListed below are some key assumptions of the model:\u00a0\n\n  * The Maryland Energy Administration will provide grants of $750/kW\u00a0 with a $7,500 cap to low to middle income homeowners for installation of a residential solar system\n\n  * The Maryland utility bill inflation rate is 2.83% annually. This number is derived from the average utility bill from 2014-2023 for five major state power companies: Delmarva Power, PEPCO, SMECO, BGE, and Potomac Edison.\u00a0\n\n  * A residential solar installation will yield positive cash flow from SREC income, as well as an implied positive cash flow from avoided utility costs\n\n  * The SACP set by the Maryland RPS will decrease incrementally as expected, and this benchmark will serve as a proxy for yearly SREC prices throughout the life of the system\u00a0\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\u301035\u2020SREC\u3011\u301036\u2020Research\u3011\u301037\u2020Maryland Certified\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301022\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30102\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Calculators\n\n  * \u30101\u2020Maryland Solar Installation Financial Model\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301011\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301029\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Maryland Certified SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Maryland GREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30103\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u301010\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30108\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301026\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301040\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301041\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u301046\u2020Disclaimer\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020User Agreement\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Auction Rules\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Fee Schedule",

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

                "text": "\nBy increasing the SACP, the law effectively increased the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs), and therefore the likely price at which SRECs will sell. Currently, the SACP is $80 per SREC for 2021 and $60 per SREC for 2022. Before SB 65, the SACP was set to drop to $45 per SREC in 2023, then $40 in 2024 and $35 in 2025. SB 65 increased these price ceilings to $60 per SREC in 2023 and 2024, and $55 in 2025.\n\nWhile the Tier I and solar carve-out requirement decreases may seem negative, the amended requirements paired with the SACP increase may positively impact Maryland SREC prices and Maryland solar build. The new requirements should help Maryland solar supply and demand move closer together. To date, Maryland\u2019s actual solar supply has lagged behind the demand for solar. By decreasing utility demand and increasing supply incentives (SREC prices), solar project origination and generation should increase accordingly.\n\nWe are already seeing Maryland SREC pricing rise and expect solar project origination to increase as well. These developments are exciting and beneficial to homeowners, installers, and developers throughout Maryland.\n\nTo compare all the RPS and SACP changes in Maryland, please refer to the table below.\n\nYear Old Solar Carve-Out New Solar Carve-Out Old Tier I Requirement New Tier I Requirement Old SACP  New SACP Tier I ACP (Unchanged)  \n2021 7.5% n/a 30.8% n/a $80.00 n/a $30.00  \n2022 8.5% 5.5% 33.1% 30.1% $60.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2023 9.5% 6.0% 35.4% 31.9% $45.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2024 10.5% 6.5% 37.7% 33.7% $40.00 $60.00 $27.50  \n2025 11.5% 7.0% 40.0% 35.5% $35.00 $55.00 $25.00  \n2026 12.5% 8.0% 42.5% 38.0% $30.00 $45.00 $24.75  \n2027 13.5% 9.5% 45.5% 41.5% $25.00 $35.00 $24.50  \n2028 14.5% 11.0% 47.5% 43.0% $22.50 $32.50 $22.50  \n2029 14.5% 12.5% 49.5% 47.5% $22.50 $25.00 $22.50  \n2030+ 14.5% 14.5% 50% 50.0% $22.50 $22.25 $22.35  \n\n* * *\n\n### Recent Articles...\n\nInsights | 20 May 2024 \n\n\u301021\u2020Good Intentions, Bad Policy, and the Threat to the Clean Energy Transition\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 20 Mar 2024 \n\n\u301022\u2020From Vision to Impact: Sol Systems\u2019 Journey Towards a Community-Focused Clean Energy Economy\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 28 Nov 2023 \n\n\u301023\u2020DC Greens: Building Impact Through a Sustainable and Resilient Food System\u3011 \n\n### Explore sustainable energy solutions with Sol Systems\n\n\u30103\u2020WHO WE SERVE\u3011\n\n\u30102\u2020WHAT WE DO\u3011\n\nLooking for something else?  \nEmail: info@solsystems.com \n\nSol Systems \n\nSol Systems is a leading, national solar energy firm with an established reputation for integrity and reliability across its distinct and complementary businesses.

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

                "text": "\nBy increasing the SACP, the law effectively increased the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs), and therefore the likely price at which SRECs will sell. Currently, the SACP is $80 per SREC for 2021 and $60 per SREC for 2022. Before SB 65, the SACP was set to drop to $45 per SREC in 2023, then $40 in 2024 and $35 in 2025. SB 65 increased these price ceilings to $60 per SREC in 2023 and 2024, and $55 in 2025.\n\nWhile the Tier I and solar carve-out requirement decreases may seem negative, the amended requirements paired with the SACP increase may positively impact Maryland SREC prices and Maryland solar build. The new requirements should help Maryland solar supply and demand move closer together. To date, Maryland\u2019s actual solar supply has lagged behind the demand for solar. By decreasing utility demand and increasing supply incentives (SREC prices), solar project origination and generation should increase accordingly.\n\nWe are already seeing Maryland SREC pricing rise and expect solar project origination to increase as well. These developments are exciting and beneficial to homeowners, installers, and developers throughout Maryland.\n\nTo compare all the RPS and SACP changes in Maryland, please refer to the table below.\n\nYear Old Solar Carve-Out New Solar Carve-Out Old Tier I Requirement New Tier I Requirement Old SACP  New SACP Tier I ACP (Unchanged)  \n2021 7.5% n/a 30.8% n/a $80.00 n/a $30.00  \n2022 8.5% 5.5% 33.1% 30.1% $60.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2023 9.5% 6.0% 35.4% 31.9% $45.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2024 10.5% 6.5% 37.7% 33.7% $40.00 $60.00 $27.50  \n2025 11.5% 7.0% 40.0% 35.5% $35.00 $55.00 $25.00  \n2026 12.5% 8.0% 42.5% 38.0% $30.00 $45.00 $24.75  \n2027 13.5% 9.5% 45.5% 41.5% $25.00 $35.00 $24.50  \n2028 14.5% 11.0% 47.5% 43.0% $22.50 $32.50 $22.50  \n2029 14.5% 12.5% 49.5% 47.5% $22.50 $25.00 $22.50  \n2030+ 14.5% 14.5% 50% 50.0% $22.50 $22.25 $22.35  \n\n* * *\n\n### Recent Articles...\n\nInsights | 20 May 2024 \n\n\u301021\u2020Good Intentions, Bad Policy, and the Threat to the Clean Energy Transition\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 20 Mar 2024 \n\n\u301022\u2020From Vision to Impact: Sol Systems\u2019 Journey Towards a Community-Focused Clean Energy Economy\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 28 Nov 2023 \n\n\u301023\u2020DC Greens: Building Impact Through a Sustainable and Resilient Food System\u3011 \n\n### Explore sustainable energy solutions with Sol Systems\n\n\u30103\u2020WHO WE SERVE\u3011\n\n\u30102\u2020WHAT WE DO\u3011\n\nLooking for something else?  \nEmail: info@solsystems.com \n\nSol Systems \n\nSol Systems is a leading, national solar energy firm with an established reputation for integrity and reliability across its distinct and complementary businesses.

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

Currently, homeowners with systems installed after 07/01/24 will begin generating Certified SRECs on 01/01/2025, which are expected to be worth around 1.5x the current Legacy MD SRECs. Homeowners in Maryland who are interested in the possibility of installing solar will benefit massively from these higher priced SRECs, and can enjoy the benefit of incentives like the Federal Investment Tax Credit and the MD FY2025 Solar Access Program, which is designed to provide grant money for low to moderate income residents.\u00a0\n\nFlett Exchange has also released a free to use solar installation financial model. We suggest using this model to fully realize the advantages and long term cash flows of a solar investment before having a conversation with a solar installer. Flett Exchange is a neutral third party that does not profit off of the installation of a solar array; we simply broker SRECs produced by homeowners. This affords us the unique position to offer unbiased, informative, and realistic forecasts and consulting on solar investments. If you are interested in potentially going solar, contact Flett Exchange for a zero cost consultation service and we can help match you with a solar installation company. The goal of Flett Exchange, ultimately, is to broker more SREC deals; we are not involved in any capacity with the process of installing solar arrays. It is our hope that this complementary service will steer you in our direction to sell your SRECs post installation.\u00a0\n\n\u301032\u2020MD Solar PV Installation Cash Flow Model\u2020www.flettexchange.com\u3011\n\nListed below are some key assumptions of the model:\u00a0\n\n  * The Maryland Energy Administration will provide grants of $750/kW\u00a0 with a $7,500 cap to low to middle income homeowners for installation of a residential solar system\n\n  * The Maryland utility bill inflation rate is 2.83% annually. This number is derived from the average utility bill from 2014-2023 for five major state power companies: Delmarva Power, PEPCO, SMECO, BGE, and Potomac Edison.\u00a0\n\n  * A residential solar installation will yield positive cash flow from SREC income, as well as an implied positive cash flow from avoided utility costs\n\n  * The SACP set by the Maryland RPS will decrease incrementally as expected, and this benchmark will serve as a proxy for yearly SREC prices throughout the life of the system\u00a0\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\u301035\u2020SREC\u3011\u301036\u2020Research\u3011\u301037\u2020Maryland Certified\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301022\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30102\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Calculators\n\n  * \u30101\u2020Maryland Solar Installation Financial Model\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301011\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301029\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Maryland Certified SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Maryland GREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30103\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u301010\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30108\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301026\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301040\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301041\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301034\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u301046\u2020Disclaimer\u3011\n  * \u301047\u2020User Agreement\u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020Auction Rules\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020Fee Schedule",

See Maryland's post here: \u301030\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nThe Governor of Maryland currently has bill HB1435/SB0737 on his desk for signature. Named \u201cThe Brighter Tomorrow Act\u201d, we have listed some of the changes that will take place if it is signed into law:\n\n  1. Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

              "snippet": "\nBy increasing the SACP, the law effectively increased the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs), and therefore the likely price at which SRECs will sell. Currently, the SACP is $80 per SREC for 2021 and $60 per SREC for 2022. Before SB 65, the SACP was set to drop to $45 per SREC in 2023, then $40 in 2024 and $35 in 2025. SB 65 increased these price ceilings to $60 per SREC in 2023 and 2024, and $55 in 2025.\n\nWhile the Tier I and solar carve-out requirement decreases may seem negative, the amended requirements paired with the SACP increase may positively impact Maryland SREC prices and Maryland solar build. The new requirements should help Maryland solar supply and demand move closer together. To date, Maryland\u2019s actual solar supply has lagged behind the demand for solar. By decreasing utility demand and increasing supply incentives (SREC prices), solar project origination and generation should increase accordingly.\n\nWe are already seeing Maryland SREC pricing rise and expect solar project origination to increase as well. These developments are exciting and beneficial to homeowners, installers, and developers throughout Maryland.\n\nTo compare all the RPS and SACP changes in Maryland, please refer to the table below.\n\nYear Old Solar Carve-Out New Solar Carve-Out Old Tier I Requirement New Tier I Requirement Old SACP  New SACP Tier I ACP (Unchanged)  \n2021 7.5% n/a 30.8% n/a $80.00 n/a $30.00  \n2022 8.5% 5.5% 33.1% 30.1% $60.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2023 9.5% 6.0% 35.4% 31.9% $45.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2024 10.5% 6.5% 37.7% 33.7% $40.00 $60.00 $27.50  \n2025 11.5% 7.0% 40.0% 35.5% $35.00 $55.00 $25.00  \n2026 12.5% 8.0% 42.5% 38.0% $30.00 $45.00 $24.75  \n2027 13.5% 9.5% 45.5% 41.5% $25.00 $35.00 $24.50  \n2028 14.5% 11.0% 47.5% 43.0% $22.50 $32.50 $22.50  \n2029 14.5% 12.5% 49.5% 47.5% $22.50 $25.00 $22.50  \n2030+ 14.5% 14.5% 50% 50.0% $22.50 $22.25 $22.35  \n\n* * *\n\n### Recent Articles...\n\nInsights | 20 May 2024 \n\n\u301021\u2020Good Intentions, Bad Policy, and the Threat to the Clean Energy Transition\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 20 Mar 2024 \n\n\u301022\u2020From Vision to Impact: Sol Systems\u2019 Journey Towards a Community-Focused Clean Energy Economy\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 28 Nov 2023 \n\n\u301023\u2020DC Greens: Building Impact Through a Sustainable and Resilient Food System\u3011 \n\n### Explore sustainable energy solutions with Sol Systems\n\n\u30103\u2020WHO WE SERVE\u3011\n\n\u30102\u2020WHAT WE DO\u3011\n\nLooking for something else?  \nEmail: info@solsystems.com \n\nSol Systems \n\nSol Systems is a leading, national solar energy firm with an established reputation for integrity and reliability across its distinct and complementary businesses.

Only NEW solar installed from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2028, before hitting total installed megawatt limits per category, will be classified as \u201cCertified SRECs\u201d and compliance buyers will be able to use them to satisfy 150% of their compliance obligation per Certified SREC.\u00a0\n\n  2. All RECs will have a 5 year life. Currently, the life is 3 years.\n\n  3. The first 300MW AC of solar 20kW and less qualify.\n\n  4. The first 270 MW AC of solar 20kW to 5MW qualify.\n\n    1. The size limit can only be above 2 MW for rooftops, parking canopies, or brownfield sites.\u00a0\n\n  5. The 150% multiplier for Certified RECs goes into effect after January 1, 2025\u00a0\n\n  6. New solar installed after July 1, 2024, will earn legacy MD SRECS until December 31, 2024, and then produce Certified SRECS thereafter for 15 years.\n\n  7. For systems larger than 1MW in size workers must be paid the prevailing wage.\n\n  8. Low Moderate Income (LMI) households at or below 150% of the average median income for the State of Maryland can apply for a grant of $750 per kW with a maximum grant of $7,500 per system.\n\nWe expect to hear by early May 2024 if the Governor signs the bill into law.\n\nCertified MD SRECs can be used for 150% of the compliance value by electricity suppliers toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard. These SRECs will command a premium to regular MD SREC. Based on this 150% multiplier we calculate the implied SACP and premium to regular MD SRECs per year:\n\nEnergy Year\n\nSACP\n\nCertified \u201cimplied\u201d SACP\n\nCertified MD SREC premium estimate  \n\n2025\n\n$55\n\n$82.50\n\n$27.50  \n\n2026\n\n$45\n\n$67.50\n\n$22.50  \n\n2027\n\n$35\n\n$52.50\n\n$17.50  \n\n2028\n\n$32.50\n\n$48.75\n\n$16.25  \n\n2029\n\n$25\n\n$37.50\n\n$12.50  \n\n2030 and later\n\n$22.50\n\n$33.75\n\n$11.25  \n\nYou can find a copy of the Maryland Solar Bill \u2013 HB1435 / SB0737 here:\n\n\u301031\u2020https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/bills/sb/sb0783E.pdf\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011\n\nTAGS:  \n\u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\u301033\u2020SREC\u3011\u301034\u2020Solar\u3011\n\n* * *\n\n##### Exchange Info\n\n  * \u301020\u2020How Flett Exchange Works\u3011 \n  * \u30101\u2020Apply for an Account\u3011\n  * \u301035\u2020Exchange Benefits\u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020What is an SREC\u3011\n\n##### Markets\n\n  * \u301010\u2020New Jersey SREC\u3011 \n  * \u301027\u2020New Jersey TREC\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Pennsylvania SREC\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Maryland SREC\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Washington DC SREC\u3011\n  * \u301016\u2020Ohio SREC\u3011\n  * \u301017\u2020Virginia REC\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020NJ Class 1\u3011 \n\n##### Services\n\n  * \u30102\u2020Public Auctions\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Long-Term SREC Contracts\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Spot Markets\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020PSE&G Solar Loan\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020JCP&L\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Atlantic City Electric\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Rockland Electric\u3011\n  * \u301036\u2020Solar Installers\u3011\n\n##### Press Releases\n\n  * \u301024\u2020New Jersey\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Pennsylvania\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Maryland\u3011\n  * \u301038\u2020Washington, DC\u3011\n  * \u301039\u2020Ohio\u3011\n  * \u301040\u2020Virginia\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Press Releases\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020RGGI\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Federal Grants\u3011\n\n##### Legal\n\n  * \u3010",

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.

              "snippet": "\nBy increasing the SACP, the law effectively increased the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs), and therefore the likely price at which SRECs will sell. Currently, the SACP is $80 per SREC for 2021 and $60 per SREC for 2022. Before SB 65, the SACP was set to drop to $45 per SREC in 2023, then $40 in 2024 and $35 in 2025. SB 65 increased these price ceilings to $60 per SREC in 2023 and 2024, and $55 in 2025.\n\nWhile the Tier I and solar carve-out requirement decreases may seem negative, the amended requirements paired with the SACP increase may positively impact Maryland SREC prices and Maryland solar build. The new requirements should help Maryland solar supply and demand move closer together. To date, Maryland\u2019s actual solar supply has lagged behind the demand for solar. By decreasing utility demand and increasing supply incentives (SREC prices), solar project origination and generation should increase accordingly.\n\nWe are already seeing Maryland SREC pricing rise and expect solar project origination to increase as well. These developments are exciting and beneficial to homeowners, installers, and developers throughout Maryland.\n\nTo compare all the RPS and SACP changes in Maryland, please refer to the table below.\n\nYear Old Solar Carve-Out New Solar Carve-Out Old Tier I Requirement New Tier I Requirement Old SACP  New SACP Tier I ACP (Unchanged)  \n2021 7.5% n/a 30.8% n/a $80.00 n/a $30.00  \n2022 8.5% 5.5% 33.1% 30.1% $60.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2023 9.5% 6.0% 35.4% 31.9% $45.00 $60.00 $30.00  \n2024 10.5% 6.5% 37.7% 33.7% $40.00 $60.00 $27.50  \n2025 11.5% 7.0% 40.0% 35.5% $35.00 $55.00 $25.00  \n2026 12.5% 8.0% 42.5% 38.0% $30.00 $45.00 $24.75  \n2027 13.5% 9.5% 45.5% 41.5% $25.00 $35.00 $24.50  \n2028 14.5% 11.0% 47.5% 43.0% $22.50 $32.50 $22.50  \n2029 14.5% 12.5% 49.5% 47.5% $22.50 $25.00 $22.50  \n2030+ 14.5% 14.5% 50% 50.0% $22.50 $22.25 $22.35  \n\n* * *\n\n### Recent Articles...\n\nInsights | 20 May 2024 \n\n\u301021\u2020Good Intentions, Bad Policy, and the Threat to the Clean Energy Transition\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 20 Mar 2024 \n\n\u301022\u2020From Vision to Impact: Sol Systems\u2019 Journey Towards a Community-Focused Clean Energy Economy\u3011 \n\nCommunity Impact | 28 Nov 2023 \n\n\u301023\u2020DC Greens: Building Impact Through a Sustainable and Resilient Food System\u3011 \n\n### Explore sustainable energy solutions with Sol Systems\n\n\u30103\u2020WHO WE SERVE\u3011\n\n\u30102\u2020WHAT WE DO\u3011\n\nLooking for something else?  \nEmail: info@solsystems.com \n\nSol Systems \n\nSol Systems is a leading, national solar energy firm with an established reputation for integrity and reliability across its distinct and complementary businesses.

These RECs are available to Maryland residential solar PV systems installed after 07/01/2024, as per the \u301032\u2020The Maryland Solar Bill\u3011.\n\nThese RECs prices will be closely correlated with Maryland\u2019s legacy market, which is what all systems installed prior to this July produce. Maryland utility companies, who are required by the state of Maryland to make an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $55.00 in 2025, can satisfy this requirement easily with the purchase of new Certified SRECs, which satisfy 150% of the ACP.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity to homeowners who sell their credits to Flett Exchange. Since energy companies are able to get a discount by buying these RECs, homeowners can sell them for more. Currently, the bid for Maryland Certified SRECs is $75.50. To learn more about the state incentives in Maryland available for FY25, review the early blog post about \u301033\u2020Maryland Certified SRECs and Cost Effective Solar Array Installation\u3011.
