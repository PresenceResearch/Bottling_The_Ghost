            "In Maryland, virtual net metering (VNM) is allowed under the state\u2019s community solar program, which enables multiple customers to benefit from a shared solar energy system. Virtual net metering is especially relevant for customers who cannot install solar panels on their property but still want to participate in solar energy programs.\n\n### Key Aspects of Virtual Net Metering in Maryland (BGE Service Area):\n\n1. **Eligibility**: In the Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) service area, eligible participants for virtual net metering include residential, commercial, industrial, non-profit, and government customers. Participants do not need to be located at the same site as the solar generation system but must be within the same utility service area.\n\n2. **Community Solar Pilot Program**: Maryland has a Community Solar Pilot Program that allows multiple customers to share the benefits of a single solar array. This program is designed to promote renewable energy growth and expand access to solar power, especially for those who cannot install solar panels on their property.\n\n3. **Credit Allocation**: Under virtual net metering, participants receive credits on their electricity bills for their share of the electricity generated by the shared solar facility. The utility (BGE in this case) applies these credits to reduce the electricity costs for each participant based on their allocated share of the total energy production.\n\n4. **Billing and Credits**: BGE calculates the credits for VNM based on the retail rate for the energy produced by the shared solar system. These credits are then applied to the participants' monthly electric bills, and any excess credits can be rolled over to future billing periods.\n\n5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) oversees the implementation and rules of the VNM and Community Solar Pilot Program. Participants and community solar providers must comply with the rules and regulations established by the PSC, including project size limits and reporting requirements.\n\n6. **Project Size and Capacity Limits**: In Maryland, virtual net metering projects are typically capped at a certain size. For community solar, the project size cannot exceed 2 MW, and there are annual limits on the total capacity available for community solar projects within each utility service area.\n\n7. **Program Duration**: The Community Solar Pilot Program in Maryland was initially set to run for a certain period, but it has been extended multiple times. The program continues to evolve based on feedback and performance, so it\u2019s important to check with the Maryland PSC or BGE for the latest updates.\n\n8. **Special Considerations for Low and Moderate-Income Customers**: The program includes specific provisions to ensure that a portion of the capacity is reserved for low and moderate-income customers, aiming to make solar energy more accessible to all.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, you should consult the Maryland Public Service Commission or the BGE website, as policies and regulations may change over time."

            "The number of subscribers that can participate in a virtual net metering (VNM) or community solar project in Maryland, particularly within the Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) service area, is not strictly capped by a specific number of subscribers. Instead, it is governed by several key factors:\n\n### Key Factors Affecting the Number of Subscribers:\n\n1. **Project Size**: The size of the community solar project is a critical factor. In Maryland, a community solar project cannot exceed 2 megawatts (MW) in capacity. The number of subscribers that a project can accommodate will depend on the total capacity of the project and the amount of electricity that each subscriber is allocated.\n\n2. **Minimum and Maximum Allocation**: Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program rules specify that a subscriber must receive at least 1 kilowatt (kW) of the project\u2019s capacity but cannot receive more than 200 kW. This range determines how many subscribers a project can have. For example, a 2 MW project could theoretically support up to 2,000 subscribers if each subscriber is allocated the minimum 1 kW of capacity. However, if subscribers receive larger allocations (e.g., 5 kW or more), the number of subscribers will be fewer.\n\n3. **Subscription Size and Energy Usage**: The actual number of subscribers may also depend on the subscribers' energy usage patterns and the share of the project's output they are subscribed to. Larger users (such as businesses) may take up a larger share of the project's capacity compared to smaller users (such as individual households).\n\n4. **Low and Moderate-Income Requirements**: Maryland\u2019s community solar regulations require that a certain percentage of each project's capacity (currently 30%) be reserved for low and moderate-income customers. This reservation may influence the total number of subscribers a project can have, depending on the size and allocation of the reserved capacity.\n\n5. **Utility Limits and Program Rules**: The Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) sets program limits and rules for each utility service area, including BGE. While there is no direct cap on the number of subscribers, the total capacity of the projects and how that capacity is allocated to different customer types (residential, commercial, low-income, etc.) will ultimately dictate the number of subscribers that can participate in any given project.\n\n6. **Host Organization Rules**: Some community solar projects may have additional rules or limitations set by the host organization (the entity managing the community solar array). These rules might include minimum subscription periods, administrative fees, or other factors that could influence the number of subscribers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile there is no specific numerical cap on the number of subscribers for virtual net metering or community solar projects in Maryland, the project's capacity, the allocation of capacity among subscribers, and regulatory requirements collectively determine the maximum number of participants. Each project's unique circumstances and the specific needs and usage of its subscribers will ultimately define how many people or entities can subscribe.\n\nFor precise details about a specific project, it's best to consult directly with the community solar provider or check with the Maryland Public Service Commission for the latest program guidelines."

            "To distribute the output of a 750 kW solar system across 168 separately metered units in your apartment community using virtual net metering (VNM), you will need to allocate the generated electricity among all the units. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of how you could distribute the output:\n\n### 1. **Determine Total Output of the Solar System:**\nA 750 kW solar system will produce a certain amount of electricity each month, depending on factors such as location, system efficiency, and sunlight hours. For example, in Maryland, a 750 kW system might produce roughly between 85,000 to 100,000 kWh per month, depending on the season and weather conditions.\n\n### 2. **Calculate Average Allocation Per Unit:**\nTo distribute the system\u2019s output among 168 units, you\u2019ll need to decide how to allocate the total production. One straightforward approach is to divide the total monthly output by the number of units:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Allocation per Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Total Monthly Output (kWh)}}{\\text{Number of Units}}\n\\]\n\nFor example, if your system produces 90,000 kWh in a given month:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Allocation per Unit} = \\frac{90,000 \\text{ kWh}}{168} \\approx 535 \\text{ kWh per unit}\n\\]\n\n### 3. **Set Up Allocation Rules:**\nYou have a few options on how to distribute the generated electricity:\n\n- **Equal Allocation:** You can distribute the solar output equally among all 168 units, meaning each unit receives an equal share of the total energy produced (e.g., 535 kWh per month). This is the simplest approach and ensures each unit benefits equally.\n\n- **Proportional to Usage:** Alternatively, you could allocate the energy based on each unit's historical electricity usage. Units with higher energy consumption would receive a larger share of the solar output. This approach requires an analysis of each unit's past consumption patterns to determine their fair share of the solar energy.\n\n- **Fixed Tiered Allocation:** You could set different allocation tiers based on unit size or type (e.g., one-bedroom vs. two-bedroom apartments). Larger units or units with more occupants could receive a higher allocation compared to smaller units.\n\n### 4. **Billing and Credit Distribution:**\nOnce the allocation is determined, the output credits can be applied to each unit\u2019s monthly electricity bill:\n\n- **Virtual Net Metering Credits:** Under Maryland\u2019s VNM rules, the utility (BGE in this case) would issue credits on each participating unit\u2019s electricity bill for their share of the solar output. For instance, if a unit is allocated 535 kWh for the month, that unit's bill would be reduced by the retail rate for 535 kWh of electricity.\n\n- **Adjustments for Overproduction or Underproduction:** If the solar system produces more electricity than the total consumption of the units, the excess credits can typically roll over to the following month. Conversely, if the system underproduces relative to the total consumption, each unit may receive a smaller credit.\n\n### 5. **Administrative and Compliance Considerations:**\n- **Utility Coordination:** You\u2019ll need to coordinate with BGE and comply with Maryland's VNM rules. Each unit's share of the solar energy must be registered with the utility, and proper agreements must be in place.\n\n- **Community Solar Agreement:** You may need to establish a community solar agreement with the tenants to define how the benefits will be distributed, any associated fees, and the duration of the agreement. \n\n- **Metering and Monitoring:** Proper metering equipment must be in place to track the solar output and its distribution. The utility will often provide the virtual net metering credits based on the allocations you set up.\n\n### 6. **Addressing Potential Challenges:**\n- **Low and Moderate-Income Requirements:** If you are using a shared community solar program, ensure compliance with any specific requirements for low and moderate-income residents.\n\n- **Communication with Residents:** Ensure all residents understand the benefits and implications of the solar system, including how their bills might change and any ongoing responsibilities.\n\n### Summary:\nBy installing a 750 kW solar system, you can use virtual net metering to distribute the energy output to all 168 units. The allocation can be equal, proportional to usage, or tiered based on unit size. You will need to coordinate with BGE and the residents to ensure proper distribution and billing of the generated electricity credits.\n\nWould you like more details on a specific aspect of the process or further guidance on any step?"

            "If all 168 units in your apartment community are low-income households, there are specific provisions and benefits available under Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program and virtual net metering (VNM) regulations that can help optimize the distribution of the solar energy generated by your 750 kW system.\n\n### Key Considerations for Low-Income Households:\n\n1. **Eligibility for Low-Income Designation**:\n   - **Definition**: Low-income households in Maryland typically qualify if their income is at or below 80% of the area median income (AMI) or based on other qualifying criteria established by the state.\n   - **Verification**: Each household may need to provide proof of eligibility to qualify for the low-income designation under Maryland's community solar program.\n\n2. **Program Benefits for Low-Income Households**:\n   Maryland\u2019s Community Solar Pilot Program has specific provisions to promote access for low-income households:\n   \n   - **No Upfront Costs**: Generally, low-income subscribers should not be required to pay any upfront costs to participate in the community solar program.\n   - **Guaranteed Savings**: The program often mandates that low-income households receive guaranteed savings on their electricity bills compared to what they would have paid without participating in the community solar program. This can translate to receiving a percentage discount on the retail rate for the allocated solar energy.\n\n3. **Allocation of Solar Credits**:\n   You can distribute the output of your 750 kW system among the 168 low-income households in a way that maximizes their benefit:\n\n   - **Equal Allocation**: You may choose to distribute the total solar output equally among all 168 units. Each household would receive an equal share of the electricity credits generated by the solar system. For example, if your 750 kW system generates 90,000 kWh in a month, each unit would receive approximately 535 kWh of credits.\n   \n   - **Custom Allocation for Greater Savings**: Consider allocating more solar energy credits to households with higher energy consumption or greater need to ensure they benefit more from the savings. This can be especially beneficial if some units use more electricity due to size or occupant needs.\n\n4. **Billing and Virtual Net Metering Credits**:\n   - **Application of Credits**: The credits will appear on each household's utility bill (from BGE) according to the allocation you have set up. If all the households are low-income, they may receive credits at a favorable rate, further reducing their electricity costs.\n   - **Excess Generation**: If the solar system generates more electricity than the community uses, the excess credits can be carried forward to the next month. Any rollover should benefit the low-income subscribers, helping to maximize their savings over time.\n\n5. **Increased Program Flexibility for Low-Income Participants**:\n   - **Increased Subscription Capacity**: The program rules may allow for a larger percentage of a project\u2019s capacity to be allocated to low-income participants. This means your entire 750 kW system can be designated to serve low-income households, which can help streamline participation and maximize benefits.\n\n6. **Potential Incentives and Support**:\n   - **Incentives for Developers**: There are often additional incentives or support available to developers who dedicate a larger portion (or all) of their project to low-income subscribers. This could include grants, tax credits, or other financial benefits.\n   - **Grants and Rebates**: You may be eligible for state or federal grants, rebates, or financing options specifically designed for solar projects that benefit low-income communities. These incentives can help offset the costs of building and maintaining the solar system.\n\n7. **Compliance and Reporting**:\n   - **Regulatory Requirements**: Ensure you comply with all Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) rules regarding low-income participation, including proper reporting, verification of income eligibility, and adherence to the program's specific rules and conditions.\n\n8. **Community Engagement and Education**:\n   - **Educate Residents**: Communicate clearly with the residents about how the solar program works, what their benefits will be, and how they will see savings on their electricity bills. Provide information in accessible formats and languages as needed.\n\n### Summary:\nBy designating your 750 kW solar system to serve all low-income households in your apartment community, you can leverage specific benefits under Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program to maximize savings for the residents. You can distribute the output equally or based on household need while ensuring compliance with state regulations and possibly accessing additional incentives for supporting low-income participants.\n\nWould you like to know more about the application process for the Community Solar Program, potential incentives, or another aspect of implementing this project?"

The borrower owes a balance of $51.7 million on the loan, according to a note shared with bondholders.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland originated the loan in 2014, quickly offloading it to a commercial mortgage-backed security trust. In mid-July, the loan was transferred to special servicing, two weeks before it matured on Aug. 1. As of two weeks ago, the special servicer was CWCapital, according to servicer notes.\n\nThe loan had been no stranger to servicer watchlists over the years, making appearances since 2017. A myriad of issues have dogged the portfolio, which mostly consists of buildings in Washington, D.C. and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAll of the buildings affected are either office or retail buildings, or a combination of the two. The largest of the buildings backing the loan is a 40,000-square-foot office property in D.C.\u2019s Brentwood neighborhood. The portfolio\u2019s retail tenants include Lululemon and Sherwin Williams.\n\n### Sign Up for the undefined Newsletter \n\nSIGN UP \n\nThe D.C.-based landlord did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe office market in the nation\u2019s capital is particularly troublesome. The district\u2019s market recently recorded \u301058\u2020its highest vacancy rate\u3011 ever as remote work and high interest rates drag down property values.\u00a0\n\nWashington office loans have the seventh-highest rate of default in the country, according to recent data from credit-research firm KBRA Analytics. In the first quarter, roughly 39 percent of securitized Washington office loans were either in default or at risk, according to the firm.\n\nIn June, the $243 million loan backing Beacon Capital Partners\u2019 Lafayette Centre office complex in the district was sent to \u301059\u2020special servicing\u3011.\n\n\u2014 \u301060\u2020Holden Walter-Warner\u3011\n\n#### Read more\n\n\u301058\u2020 Commercial Washington D.C.

(Douglas Development, Google Maps)\n\nAug 28, 2024, 4:00 PM \n\nBy \n\n  * \u301056\u2020TRD Staff\u3011\n\nSave article \n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \n\nFONT SIZE \n\nA A A \n\nDouglas Development ran into a bit of trouble regarding a Washington, D.C.-area portfolio of more than a dozen buildings.\n\nThe developer defaulted on a loan tied to 15 properties, the Washington Business Journal \u301057\u2020reported\u2020www.bizjournals.com\u3011. The borrower owes a balance of $51.7 million on the loan, according to a note shared with bondholders.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland originated the loan in 2014, quickly offloading it to a commercial mortgage-backed security trust. In mid-July, the loan was transferred to special servicing, two weeks before it matured on Aug. 1. As of two weeks ago, the special servicer was CWCapital, according to servicer notes.\n\nThe loan had been no stranger to servicer watchlists over the years, making appearances since 2017. A myriad of issues have dogged the portfolio, which mostly consists of buildings in Washington, D.C. and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAll of the buildings affected are either office or retail buildings, or a combination of the two. The largest of the buildings backing the loan is a 40,000-square-foot office property in D.C.\u2019s Brentwood neighborhood. The portfolio\u2019s retail tenants include Lululemon and Sherwin Williams.\n\n### Sign Up for the undefined Newsletter \n\nSIGN UP \n\nThe D.C.-based landlord did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe office market in the nation\u2019s capital is particularly troublesome. The district\u2019s market recently recorded \u301058\u2020its highest vacancy rate\u3011 ever as remote work and high interest rates drag down property values.\u00a0\n\nWashington office loans have the seventh-highest rate of default in the country, according to recent data from credit-research firm KBRA Analytics. In the first quarter, roughly 39 percent of securitized Washington office loans were either in default or at risk, according to the firm.\n\nIn June, the $243 million loan backing Beacon Capital Partners\u2019 Lafayette Centre office complex in the district was sent to \u301059\u2020special servicing\u3011.\n\n\u2014 \u301060\u2020Holden Walter-Warner\u3011\n\n#### Read more\n\n\u301058\u2020 Commercial Washington D.C.

The borrower owes a balance of $51.7 million on the loan, according to a note shared with bondholders.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland originated the loan in 2014, quickly offloading it to a commercial mortgage-backed security trust. In mid-July, the loan was transferred to special servicing, two weeks before it matured on Aug. 1. As of two weeks ago, the special servicer was CWCapital, according to servicer notes.\n\nThe loan had been no stranger to servicer watchlists over the years, making appearances since 2017. A myriad of issues have dogged the portfolio, which mostly consists of buildings in Washington, D.C. and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAll of the buildings affected are either office or retail buildings, or a combination of the two. The largest of the buildings backing the loan is a 40,000-square-foot office property in D.C.\u2019s Brentwood neighborhood. The portfolio\u2019s retail tenants include Lululemon and Sherwin Williams.\n\n### Sign Up for the undefined Newsletter \n\nSIGN UP \n\nThe D.C.-based landlord did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe office market in the nation\u2019s capital is particularly troublesome. The district\u2019s market recently recorded \u301058\u2020its highest vacancy rate\u3011 ever as remote work and high interest rates drag down property values.\u00a0\n\nWashington office loans have the seventh-highest rate of default in the country, according to recent data from credit-research firm KBRA Analytics. In the first quarter, roughly 39 percent of securitized Washington office loans were either in default or at risk, according to the firm.\n\nIn June, the $243 million loan backing Beacon Capital Partners\u2019 Lafayette Centre office complex in the district was sent to \u301059\u2020special servicing\u3011.\n\n\u2014 \u301060\u2020Holden Walter-Warner\u3011\n\n#### Read more\n\n\u301058\u2020 Commercial Washington D.C.

The borrower owes a balance of $51.7 million on the loan, according to a note shared with bondholders.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland originated the loan in 2014, quickly offloading it to a commercial mortgage-backed security trust. In mid-July, the loan was transferred to special servicing, two weeks before it matured on Aug. 1. As of two weeks ago, the special servicer was CWCapital, according to servicer notes.\n\nThe loan had been no stranger to servicer watchlists over the years, making appearances since 2017. A myriad of issues have dogged the portfolio, which mostly consists of buildings in Washington, D.C. and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAll of the buildings affected are either office or retail buildings, or a combination of the two. The largest of the buildings backing the loan is a 40,000-square-foot office property in D.C.\u2019s Brentwood neighborhood. The portfolio\u2019s retail tenants include Lululemon and Sherwin Williams.\n\n### Sign Up for the undefined Newsletter \n\nSIGN UP \n\nThe D.C.-based landlord did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe office market in the nation\u2019s capital is particularly troublesome. The district\u2019s market recently recorded \u301058\u2020its highest vacancy rate\u3011 ever as remote work and high interest rates drag down property values.\u00a0\n\nWashington office loans have the seventh-highest rate of default in the country, according to recent data from credit-research firm KBRA Analytics. In the first quarter, roughly 39 percent of securitized Washington office loans were either in default or at risk, according to the firm.\n\nIn June, the $243 million loan backing Beacon Capital Partners\u2019 Lafayette Centre office complex in the district was sent to \u301059\u2020special servicing\u3011.\n\n\u2014 \u301060\u2020Holden Walter-Warner\u3011\n\n#### Read more\n\n\u301058\u2020 Commercial Washington D.C.

It totaled $63.5M when it was originated in 2014.\u00a0\n\nDouglas didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe\u00a0portfolio is\u00a0spread across D.C., Maryland and Virginia, with 10 properties in the District, three\u00a0in Old Town\u00a0\u301049\u2020Alexandria\u3011\u00a0and one in\u00a0\u301050\u2020Rockville\u3011.\u00a0\n\nThe properties range between 3K SF and 41K SF,\u00a0with the vast majority smaller than 8K SF. Tenants range from yoga studios and medical practices to a paint store to one of D.C.\u2019s most beloved ramen spots, Daikaya.\n\nA few doors down from Daikaya, 717 Sixth St. NW, which\u00a0housed\u00a0Bar Deco\u00a0\u301051\u2020until last winter\u2020www.wusa9.com\u3011, is also part of the loan portfolio. Douglas has put that 7,500 SF vacant property\u00a0\u301052\u2020up for sale\u2020www.ten-x.com\u3011.\u00a0\n\nThe D.C. government\u00a0occupies the portfolio's\u00a0largest property at 920-928 Rhode Island Ave. NE, which houses the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center and D.C. Superior Court offices.\n\nOccupancy across the\u00a014 properties was at 83% as of March,\u00a0according to Morningstar. Douglas had remained current on the loan until it failed to pay the balance on its Aug. 1 maturity date.\u00a0\n\nThe financials of the portfolio\u00a0have remained stable, but it wasn\u2019t performing well enough to refinance in today's difficult\u00a0capital markets environment, Morningstar Credit Senior Vice President\u00a0\u301053\u2020David Putro\u3011\u00a0said in an email to\u00a0Bisnow.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNet cash flow in 2023 was roughly the same as at underwriting back in 2014 and portfolio occupancy has stayed above 80%, down a bit from issuance but not terrible by any means,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with higher rates and tighter underwriting these days, it wasn\u2019t able to re-fi.\u201d\n\nThe original loan was for 15 properties, but Douglas\u00a0\u301054\u2020sold one of the assets\u2020www.alxnow.com\u3011, a 7K SF retail building at 100 King St. in\u00a0Alexandria, in 2022.\u00a0\n\nThe portfolio is a small portion of Douglas\u2019 overall footprint. The D.C.-based, family-owned development firm owns\u00a014M SF across the mid-Atlantic. In the District, it\u00a0owns office, hotel, multifamily and retail developments like 655 New York Ave. NW, Chinatown Row, the Woodies Building, the\u00a0\u301055\u2020Hecht Warehouse\u3011\u00a0and a site in Northeast where it\u00a0\u301056\u2020filed plans this year\u3011\u00a0for a 186K SF\u00a0warehouse.\n\nContact Emily Wishingrad at emily.wishingrad@bisnow.com\n\nRelated Topics:  \u301047\u2020Douglas Development\u3011,  \u301057\u2020CMBS\u3011,  \u301053\u2020David Putro\u3011,  \u301058\u2020Morningstar Credit Information & Analytics\u3011\n\nSign up for more articles like this\n\nSubscribe to Bisnow's Washington, D.C.

Douglas had remained current on the loan until it failed to pay the balance on its Aug. 1 maturity date.\u00a0\n\nThe financials of the portfolio\u00a0have remained stable, but it wasn\u2019t performing well enough to refinance in today's difficult\u00a0capital markets environment, Morningstar Credit Senior Vice President\u00a0\u301053\u2020David Putro\u3011\u00a0said in an email to\u00a0Bisnow.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNet cash flow in 2023 was roughly the same as at underwriting back in 2014 and portfolio occupancy has stayed above 80%, down a bit from issuance but not terrible by any means,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with higher rates and tighter underwriting these days, it wasn\u2019t able to re-fi.\u201d\n\nThe original loan was for 15 properties, but Douglas\u00a0\u301054\u2020sold one of the assets\u2020www.alxnow.com\u3011, a 7K SF retail building at 100 King St. in\u00a0Alexandria, in 2022.\u00a0\n\nThe portfolio is a small portion of Douglas\u2019 overall footprint. The D.C.-based, family-owned development firm owns\u00a014M SF across the mid-Atlantic. In the District, it\u00a0owns office, hotel, multifamily and retail developments like 655 New York Ave. NW, Chinatown Row, the Woodies Building, the\u00a0\u301055\u2020Hecht Warehouse\u3011\u00a0and a site in Northeast where it\u00a0\u301056\u2020filed plans this year\u3011\u00a0for a 186K SF\u00a0warehouse.\n\nContact Emily Wishingrad at emily.wishingrad@bisnow.com\n\nRelated Topics:  \u301047\u2020Douglas Development\u3011,  \u301057\u2020CMBS\u3011,  \u301053\u2020David Putro\u3011,  \u301058\u2020Morningstar Credit Information & Analytics\u3011\n\nSign up for more articles like this\n\nSubscribe to Bisnow's Washington, D.C.

            "Douglas Development defaulted on a loan tied to a portfolio of 15 properties in the Washington, D.C., area. The properties primarily consist of office and retail buildings, or a combination of the two. Among these properties are:\n\n- **10 buildings in Washington, D.C.**: This includes a 40,000-square-foot office property in the Brentwood neighborhood, as well as other buildings with tenants such as Lululemon and Sherwin Williams. One of the properties, located at 920-928 Rhode Island Avenue NE, houses the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center and D.C. Superior Court offices.\n  \n- **3 properties in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia**: These properties vary in size, with tenants ranging from yoga studios to medical practices.\n\n- **1 property in Rockville, Maryland**: This building is part of the diverse portfolio spread across the region.\n\nThe loan, originally worth around $63.5 million when it was originated in 2014, had a remaining balance of $51.7 million at the time of default. The loan was transferred to special servicing shortly before its maturity on August 1, 2024, due to difficulties in refinancing in the current capital markets environment, which included higher interest rates and tighter lending standards.\n\nFor further details, you can check the full report on [The Real Deal](https://therealdeal.com/national/washington-dc/2024/08/28/douglas-development-defaults-on-debt-tied-to-d-c-buildings/)\u301016\u2020source\u3011."

It totaled $63.5M when it was originated in 2014.\u00a0\n\nDouglas didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe\u00a0portfolio is\u00a0spread across D.C., Maryland and Virginia, with 10 properties in the District, three\u00a0in Old Town\u00a0\u301049\u2020Alexandria\u3011\u00a0and one in\u00a0\u301050\u2020Rockville\u3011.\u00a0\n\nThe properties range between 3K SF and 41K SF,\u00a0with the vast majority smaller than 8K SF.

Portfolio \n\n\u301018\u2020Washington, D.C.\u3011 \u301044\u2020Capital Markets\u3011 View count: \n\n\u301018\u2020Washington, D.C.\u3011 \u301044\u2020Capital Markets\u3011 \n\nAugust 26, 2024 \u301045\u2020 Emily Wishingrad, Washington, D.C. \u3011 \n\nOne of the District\u2019s largest property owners has defaulted on a loan backed by\u00a014 mixed-use buildings\u00a0in the D.C. area.\u00a0\n\n[Image 0: Placeholder] \n\n\u301046\u2020 Google Maps \u2020maps.app.goo.gl\u3011 \n\n700 King St. in Old Town Alexandria is part of the Douglas portfolio.\n\n\u301047\u2020Douglas Development\u3011\u00a0went into default\u00a0on the $51.6M CMBS loan\u00a0when it matured on Aug. 1, according to\u00a0\u301048\u2020Morningstar Credit\u3011.\n\nThe loan was transferred to\u00a0special servicing in July ahead of the maturity. It totaled $63.5M when it was originated in 2014.\u00a0\n\nDouglas didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe\u00a0portfolio is\u00a0spread across D.C., Maryland and Virginia, with 10 properties in the District, three\u00a0in Old Town\u00a0\u301049\u2020Alexandria\u3011\u00a0and one in\u00a0\u301050\u2020Rockville\u3011.\u00a0\n\nThe properties range between 3K SF and 41K SF,\u00a0with the vast majority smaller than 8K SF. Tenants range from yoga studios and medical practices to a paint store to one of D.C.\u2019s most beloved ramen spots, Daikaya.\n\nA few doors down from Daikaya, 717 Sixth St. NW, which\u00a0housed\u00a0Bar Deco\u00a0\u301051\u2020until last winter\u2020www.wusa9.com\u3011, is also part of the loan portfolio. Douglas has put that 7,500 SF vacant property\u00a0\u301052\u2020up for sale\u2020www.ten-x.com\u3011.\u00a0\n\nThe D.C. government\u00a0occupies the portfolio's\u00a0largest property at 920-928 Rhode Island Ave. NE, which houses the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center and D.C. Superior Court offices.\n\nOccupancy across the\u00a014 properties was at 83% as of March,\u00a0according to Morningstar. Douglas had remained current on the loan until it failed to pay the balance on its Aug. 1 maturity date.\u00a0\n\nThe financials of the portfolio\u00a0have remained stable, but it wasn\u2019t performing well enough to refinance in today's difficult\u00a0capital markets environment, Morningstar Credit Senior Vice President\u00a0\u301053\u2020David Putro\u3011\u00a0said in an email to\u00a0Bisnow.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNet cash flow in 2023 was roughly the same as at underwriting back in 2014 and portfolio occupancy has stayed above 80%, down a bit from issuance but not terrible by any means,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with higher rates and tighter underwriting these days, it wasn\u2019t able to re-fi.\u201d\n\nThe original loan was for 15 properties, but Douglas\u00a0\u301054\u2020sold one of the assets\u2020www.alxnow.com\u3011, a 7K SF retail building at 100 King St. in\u00a0Alexandria, in 2022.\u00a0\n\nThe portfolio is a small portion of Douglas\u2019 overall footprint. The D.C.-based, family-owned development firm owns\u00a014M SF across the mid-Atlantic. In the District, it\u00a0owns office, hotel, multifamily and retail developments like 655 New York Ave. NW, Chinatown Row, the Woodies Building, the\u00a0\u301055\u2020Hecht Warehouse\u3011\u00a0and a site in Northeast where it\u00a0\u301056\u2020filed plans this year\u3011\u00a0for a 186K SF\u00a0warehouse.\n\nContact Emily Wishingrad at emily.wishingrad@bisnow.com\n\nRelated Topics:  \u301047\u2020Douglas Development\u3011,  \u301057\u2020CMBS\u3011,  \u301053\u2020David Putro\u3011,  \u301058\u2020Morningstar Credit Information & Analytics\u3011\n\nSign up for more articles like this\n\nSubscribe to Bisnow's Washington, D.C.
