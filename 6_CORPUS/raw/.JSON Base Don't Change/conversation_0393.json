Here is some context below.  Alright so my mom, Lori Yates, and Paul went to Bowie Senior High School together. She started working for the Susan G. Komen organization after her bout with breast cancer and was finally in remission. Paul's wife had breast cancer as well but she can't remember her name. My mom worked on a charity event called Concert for the Cure that ran 3 years in a row. Paul and his band performed and he also donated guitars each year. She worked and communicated with him direct as well as his personal assistant but she doesn't know if his assistant would be the same person she has in her emails. \r\n\r\nI didn't know they went to high school together so that's a BIG plus!!!"

My name is [Your Name], and I\u2019m Lori Yates' daughter. I recently learned that you and my mom went to Bowie Senior High together, which was such a pleasant surprise! She speaks very fondly of the time you worked together on the Concert for the Cure events and remembers how generous you were with both your time and donations.\n\nI work in the solar industry, and I wanted to introduce you to my daughter, [Your Daughter\u2019s Name], who is also in the solar field. She is passionate about helping businesses go solar, and I was wondering if you might be open to a quick 10-minute call with her to discuss the possibility of installing solar panels at your factory in Maryland.\n\nIf this is something you\u2019d be interested in exploring, please let me know, and I can coordinate the introduction.\n\nThank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make any adjustments!"

This introduction builds on the SE Series already versatile offering with an elevated Custom 24, the CE\u2019s first appearance in the SE Series, and the Swamp Ash Special returning to the PRS catalog.\n\n\u201cWe have so much inspiration and energy behind product development for the SE Series because it is a range of instruments that we know is supporting everyone from beginning players to professional musicians. We draw from our Maryland innovations, our history, and our own curiosities as players and builders,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, PRS Guitars COO. \u201cI think these new models will continue the SE Series promise to deliver quality tools for musicians.\u201d\n\nSE CE 24 & SE Swamp Ash Special\n\n[Image 4]\n\nThe PRS SE CE 24 brings the CE model to the SE Series for the first time. PRS fans will recognize this model, as it was first introduced back in 1988 \u2013 the company\u2019s third year in business. The CE 24 pairs PRS\u2019s traditional Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a 25\u201d scale length bolt-on maple neck. Additional features include a pair of PRS 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers and the patented PRS tremolo bridge. For 2024, the PRS SE CE 24 comes in four colors: Black Cherry, Blood Orange, Turquoise, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nWith a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and a versatile voice for the PRS SE Series. This guitar features neck and bridge 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers with a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil \u201cS\u201d pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 single coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which add mass to the pickup helping to create a more powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, the configuration gives players an array of tones. The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special comes in Charcoal, Iri Blue, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\nBoth of these bolt-on guitars (the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special) feature a new, ergonomic heel design, which is contoured for a comfortable playing experience higher up on the neck. \u201cWhen we were designing these guitars, I took an early prototype home and carved the heel by hand. The Engineering team here made some improvements and programed that shape for our partners at PT Cort. We think players will appreciate the ease of access this design brings,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, COO.\n\nSE Custom 24 Quilt\n\n[Image 6]\n\nAlso joining the SE Series is the elevated SE Custom 24 Quilt. Featuring a quilted maple veneer and matching stained quilted maple headstock veneer, the SE Custom 24 Quilt is an elegant version of PRS\u2019s most popular model. This guitar also boasts an ebony fretboard with abalone bird inlays to complete the package. The color palette for the SE Custom 24 Quilt is: Black Gold Burst, Turquoise, and Violet.\n\nNew Colors\n\nFinally, PRS is known for its striking color options, and the SE Series is no exception. For 2024, Turquoise is making its way through the SE Series and will now be available on the following models: PRS SE Custom 24, SE Custom 24-08, SE Custom 24 \u201cLefty,\u201d SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and the SE Paul\u2019s Guitar. The Custom 24-08 is also adding Blood Orange to its assortment.

          "text": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory.\u00a0\n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price.\u00a0These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes.\u00a0\n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of PRS guitars - and well\u2026 the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers.\u00a0\n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his \u301078\u2020electric guitars\u3011, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny \u2013 design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding \u301079\u2020acoustic guitars\u3011 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith.\u00a0\n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power.\u00a0\n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul\u2019s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS\u2019 custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul\u2019s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It\u2019s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that\u2019s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It\u2019s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS\u2019 Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they\u2019re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand\u2019s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you\u2019d expect.\n\nRead more on \u301080\u2020how we test gear and service at Guitar Player\u3011.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.

                "text": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory.\u00a0\n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price.\u00a0These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes.\u00a0\n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of PRS guitars - and well\u2026 the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers.\u00a0\n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his \u301078\u2020electric guitars\u3011, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny \u2013 design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding \u301079\u2020acoustic guitars\u3011 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith.\u00a0\n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power.\u00a0\n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul\u2019s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS\u2019 custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul\u2019s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It\u2019s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that\u2019s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It\u2019s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS\u2019 Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they\u2019re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand\u2019s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you\u2019d expect.\n\nRead more on \u301080\u2020how we test gear and service at Guitar Player\u3011.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.

Paul Reed Smith offers a checklist of considerations, including the invisible ones, for guitar hunters.\n\nLet me start with a story.\u301094\u2020 I \u2020www.youtube.com\u3011once had a \u301095\u20201969 Telecaster\u3011 neck covered in \u301096\u2020polyester\u3011 finish that was really thick. We stripped the finish off the neck, and the neck literally started to come apart. The skunk stripe in the back started to shrink and come loose. Basically, the neck was built with really wet wood, and it had been encased in polyester for decades\u2014like a swimming pool..\n\nThis was not something that could be seen at the point of purchase. But at some point, that company wasn\u2019t drying the wood, because my experience with instruments built around 1964 is that they didn\u2019t have this problem. I\u2019ve never seen a vintage Fender built before 1964 where the frets were sticking out the side of the neck because they hadn\u2019t dried the fretboard well enough, and it shrank.\n\nFor the most part, there\u2019s an extraordinary amount of trust when you\u2019re buying an instrument. For example, customers trust that the frets are installed in the correct positions without checking each fret position with a tuner. This trust is mostly deserved, as most frets are generally installed in the right places. What\u2019s sometimes not installed in the correct place is the nut. This controls how open chords play in tune down in the first position. I\u2019m going to make a list of the things I believe you can see when you buy a guitar, and the things you can\u2019t.

It\u2019s been a long time since we worked together on the Concert for the Cure events, and I wanted to express my gratitude again for all of your support. Your performances and generous guitar donations were instrumental in making those events successful. I often think back on those years with fondness and appreciation.\n\nI also wanted to introduce you to my daughter, [Your Daughter\u2019s Name], who works in the solar industry here in Maryland. She\u2019s passionate about helping businesses like PRS Guitars transition to renewable energy. I know your Maryland factory is the heart of your operations, and with PRS\u2019s constant innovations, like the new models in the 2024 SE Series lineup, it seems like a perfect fit to explore solar energy options for the factory.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to the idea, would you be willing to take a quick 10-minute call with her to discuss the possibility of installing solar panels at your facility?\n\nThank you for considering this, and I hope we can reconnect soon!\n\nWarmly,  \nLori Yates  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nThis version mentions the recent release of the 2024 SE Series, which aligns with PRS Guitars' innovative approach to both products and operations\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011.

This introduction builds on the SE Series already versatile offering with an elevated Custom 24, the CE\u2019s first appearance in the SE Series, and the Swamp Ash Special returning to the PRS catalog.\n\n\u201cWe have so much inspiration and energy behind product development for the SE Series because it is a range of instruments that we know is supporting everyone from beginning players to professional musicians. We draw from our Maryland innovations, our history, and our own curiosities as players and builders,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, PRS Guitars COO. \u201cI think these new models will continue the SE Series promise to deliver quality tools for musicians.\u201d\n\nSE CE 24 & SE Swamp Ash Special\n\n[Image 4]\n\nThe PRS SE CE 24 brings the CE model to the SE Series for the first time. PRS fans will recognize this model, as it was first introduced back in 1988 \u2013 the company\u2019s third year in business. The CE 24 pairs PRS\u2019s traditional Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a 25\u201d scale length bolt-on maple neck. Additional features include a pair of PRS 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers and the patented PRS tremolo bridge. For 2024, the PRS SE CE 24 comes in four colors: Black Cherry, Blood Orange, Turquoise, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nWith a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and a versatile voice for the PRS SE Series. This guitar features neck and bridge 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers with a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil \u201cS\u201d pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 single coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which add mass to the pickup helping to create a more powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, the configuration gives players an array of tones. The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special comes in Charcoal, Iri Blue, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\nBoth of these bolt-on guitars (the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special) feature a new, ergonomic heel design, which is contoured for a comfortable playing experience higher up on the neck. \u201cWhen we were designing these guitars, I took an early prototype home and carved the heel by hand. The Engineering team here made some improvements and programed that shape for our partners at PT Cort. We think players will appreciate the ease of access this design brings,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, COO.\n\nSE Custom 24 Quilt\n\n[Image 6]\n\nAlso joining the SE Series is the elevated SE Custom 24 Quilt. Featuring a quilted maple veneer and matching stained quilted maple headstock veneer, the SE Custom 24 Quilt is an elegant version of PRS\u2019s most popular model. This guitar also boasts an ebony fretboard with abalone bird inlays to complete the package. The color palette for the SE Custom 24 Quilt is: Black Gold Burst, Turquoise, and Violet.\n\nNew Colors\n\nFinally, PRS is known for its striking color options, and the SE Series is no exception. For 2024, Turquoise is making its way through the SE Series and will now be available on the following models: PRS SE Custom 24, SE Custom 24-08, SE Custom 24 \u201cLefty,\u201d SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and the SE Paul\u2019s Guitar. The Custom 24-08 is also adding Blood Orange to its assortment. And, finally, Charcoal will be offered on the SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and SE Paul\u2019s Guitar.\n\nFor the complete lineup, model specifications, and videos, please visit\u00a0\u301056\u2020www.p",

                "url": "https://www.guitarplayer.com/gear/best-prs-guitars",
                "text": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory.\u00a0\n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price.\u00a0These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes.\u00a0\n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of PRS guitars - and well\u2026 the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers.\u00a0\n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his \u301078\u2020electric guitars\u3011, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny \u2013 design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding \u301079\u2020acoustic guitars\u3011 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith.\u00a0\n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power.\u00a0\n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul\u2019s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS\u2019 custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul\u2019s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It\u2019s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that\u2019s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It\u2019s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS\u2019 Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they\u2019re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand\u2019s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you\u2019d expect.\n\nRead more on \u301080\u2020how we test gear and service at Guitar Player\u3011.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.

This introduction builds on the SE Series already versatile offering with an elevated Custom 24, the CE\u2019s first appearance in the SE Series, and the Swamp Ash Special returning to the PRS catalog.\n\n\u201cWe have so much inspiration and energy behind product development for the SE Series because it is a range of instruments that we know is supporting everyone from beginning players to professional musicians. We draw from our Maryland innovations, our history, and our own curiosities as players and builders,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, PRS Guitars COO. \u201cI think these new models will continue the SE Series promise to deliver quality tools for musicians.\u201d\n\nSE CE 24 & SE Swamp Ash Special\n\n[Image 4]\n\nThe PRS SE CE 24 brings the CE model to the SE Series for the first time. PRS fans will recognize this model, as it was first introduced back in 1988 \u2013 the company\u2019s third year in business. The CE 24 pairs PRS\u2019s traditional Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a 25\u201d scale length bolt-on maple neck. Additional features include a pair of PRS 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers and the patented PRS tremolo bridge. For 2024, the PRS SE CE 24 comes in four colors: Black Cherry, Blood Orange, Turquoise, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nWith a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and a versatile voice for the PRS SE Series. This guitar features neck and bridge 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers with a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil \u201cS\u201d pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 single coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which add mass to the pickup helping to create a more powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, the configuration gives players an array of tones. The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special comes in Charcoal, Iri Blue, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\nBoth of these bolt-on guitars (the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special) feature a new, ergonomic heel design, which is contoured for a comfortable playing experience higher up on the neck. \u201cWhen we were designing these guitars, I took an early prototype home and carved the heel by hand. The Engineering team here made some improvements and programed that shape for our partners at PT Cort. We think players will appreciate the ease of access this design brings,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, COO.\n\nSE Custom 24 Quilt\n\n[Image 6]\n\nAlso joining the SE Series is the elevated SE Custom 24 Quilt. Featuring a quilted maple veneer and matching stained quilted maple headstock veneer, the SE Custom 24 Quilt is an elegant version of PRS\u2019s most popular model. This guitar also boasts an ebony fretboard with abalone bird inlays to complete the package. The color palette for the SE Custom 24 Quilt is: Black Gold Burst, Turquoise, and Violet.\n\nNew Colors\n\nFinally, PRS is known for its striking color options, and the SE Series is no exception. For 2024, Turquoise is making its way through the SE Series and will now be available on the following models: PRS SE Custom 24, SE Custom 24-08, SE Custom 24 \u201cLefty,\u201d SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and the SE Paul\u2019s Guitar. The Custom 24-08 is also adding Blood Orange to its assortment. And, finally, Charcoal will be offered on the SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and SE Paul\u2019s Guitar.\n\nFor the complete lineup, model specifications, and videos, please visit\u00a0\u301056\u2020www.p"

              "snippet": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory.\u00a0\n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price.\u00a0These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes.\u00a0\n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of PRS guitars - and well\u2026 the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers.\u00a0\n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his \u301078\u2020electric guitars\u3011, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny \u2013 design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding \u301079\u2020acoustic guitars\u3011 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith.\u00a0\n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power.\u00a0\n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul\u2019s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS\u2019 custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul\u2019s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It\u2019s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that\u2019s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It\u2019s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS\u2019 Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they\u2019re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand\u2019s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you\u2019d expect.\n\nRead more on \u301080\u2020how we test gear and service at Guitar Player\u3011.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.

            "The new 2024 PRS SE Series models, particularly the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special, have been well-received by the guitar community. These models build on PRS's reputation for combining quality craftsmanship with innovative design. For example, the SE CE 24 marks the first time the CE model is available in the SE line, and the Swamp Ash Special returns with fresh features, both of which showcase PRS's continued focus on versatility and player-friendly design\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe reception in terms of sales and reviews suggests that these models are successful. They offer players an affordable yet high-quality option, with attention to details like the ergonomic heel design and improved tonal versatility, which have been highlighted in reviews\u301014\u2020source\u3011. Additionally, the inclusion of signature PRS elements, like the 85/15 pickups and innovative tremolo systems, further reinforces their popularity, especially among both professional musicians and hobbyists\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 models appear to be doing well in the market, appreciated for their balance of quality, affordability, and PRS\u2019s characteristic attention to innovation."

This introduction builds on the SE Series already versatile offering with an elevated Custom 24, the CE\u2019s first appearance in the SE Series, and the Swamp Ash Special returning to the PRS catalog.\n\n\u201cWe have so much inspiration and energy behind product development for the SE Series because it is a range of instruments that we know is supporting everyone from beginning players to professional musicians. We draw from our Maryland innovations, our history, and our own curiosities as players and builders,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, PRS Guitars COO. \u201cI think these new models will continue the SE Series promise to deliver quality tools for musicians.\u201d\n\nSE CE 24 & SE Swamp Ash Special\n\n[Image 4]\n\nThe PRS SE CE 24 brings the CE model to the SE Series for the first time. PRS fans will recognize this model, as it was first introduced back in 1988 \u2013 the company\u2019s third year in business. The CE 24 pairs PRS\u2019s traditional Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a 25\u201d scale length bolt-on maple neck. Additional features include a pair of PRS 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers and the patented PRS tremolo bridge. For 2024, the PRS SE CE 24 comes in four colors: Black Cherry, Blood Orange, Turquoise, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nWith a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and a versatile voice for the PRS SE Series. This guitar features neck and bridge 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers with a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil \u201cS\u201d pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 single coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which add mass to the pickup helping to create a more powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, the configuration gives players an array of tones. The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special comes in Charcoal, Iri Blue, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\nBoth of these bolt-on guitars (the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special) feature a new, ergonomic heel design, which is contoured for a comfortable playing experience higher up on the neck. \u201cWhen we were designing these guitars, I took an early prototype home and carved the heel by hand. The Engineering team here made some improvements and programed that shape for our partners at PT Cort. We think players will appreciate the ease of access this design brings,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, COO.\n\nSE Custom 24 Quilt\n\n[Image 6]\n\nAlso joining the SE Series is the elevated SE Custom 24 Quilt. Featuring a quilted maple veneer and matching stained quilted maple headstock veneer, the SE Custom 24 Quilt is an elegant version of PRS\u2019s most popular model. This guitar also boasts an ebony fretboard with abalone bird inlays to complete the package. The color palette for the SE Custom 24 Quilt is: Black Gold Burst, Turquoise, and Violet.\n\nNew Colors\n\nFinally, PRS is known for its striking color options, and the SE Series is no exception. For 2024, Turquoise is making its way through the SE Series and will now be available on the following models: PRS SE Custom 24, SE Custom 24-08, SE Custom 24 \u201cLefty,\u201d SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and the SE Paul\u2019s Guitar. The Custom 24-08 is also adding Blood Orange to its assortment. And, finally, Charcoal will be offered on the SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and SE Paul\u2019s Guitar.\n\nFor the complete lineup, model specifications, and videos, please visit\u00a0\u301056\u2020www.p",

                "text": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory.\u00a0\n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price.\u00a0These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes.\u00a0\n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of PRS guitars - and well\u2026 the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers.\u00a0\n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his \u301078\u2020electric guitars\u3011, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny \u2013 design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding \u301079\u2020acoustic guitars\u3011 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith.\u00a0\n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power.\u00a0\n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul\u2019s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS\u2019 custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul\u2019s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It\u2019s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that\u2019s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It\u2019s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS\u2019 Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they\u2019re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand\u2019s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you\u2019d expect.\n\nRead more on \u301080\u2020how we test gear and service at Guitar Player\u3011.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.

Played by internationally touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the Custom 24 features PRS\u2019s patented tremolo system and PRS 85/15 treble and bass pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. 85/15 pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith for PRS\u2019s 30th Anniversary. They offer remarkable clarity and extended high and low end.\n\nThe Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique tonal option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability.\n\nPickup Switching Positions:  \n\nPosition One:\u00a0Bridge humbucker   \nPosition Two:\u00a0Bridge humbucker with neck singlecoil, in parallel   \nPosition Three:\u00a0Bridge and neck humbuckers   \nPosition Four:\u00a0Neck singlecoil with bridge singlecoil, in parallel   \nPosition Five:\u00a0Neck humbucker   \n\nPlease check the picture of the hang tag for all the specs on this one!\n\nShow More \n\n#### Reverb Buyer Protection \n\nReverb has your back if your item is lost, damaged, or doesn't match its description.

This introduction builds on the SE Series already versatile offering with an elevated Custom 24, the CE\u2019s first appearance in the SE Series, and the Swamp Ash Special returning to the PRS catalog.\n\n\u201cWe have so much inspiration and energy behind product development for the SE Series because it is a range of instruments that we know is supporting everyone from beginning players to professional musicians. We draw from our Maryland innovations, our history, and our own curiosities as players and builders,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, PRS Guitars COO. \u201cI think these new models will continue the SE Series promise to deliver quality tools for musicians.\u201d\n\nSE CE 24 & SE Swamp Ash Special\n\n[Image 4]\n\nThe PRS SE CE 24 brings the CE model to the SE Series for the first time. PRS fans will recognize this model, as it was first introduced back in 1988 \u2013 the company\u2019s third year in business. The CE 24 pairs PRS\u2019s traditional Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a 25\u201d scale length bolt-on maple neck. Additional features include a pair of PRS 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers and the patented PRS tremolo bridge. For 2024, the PRS SE CE 24 comes in four colors: Black Cherry, Blood Orange, Turquoise, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nWith a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and a versatile voice for the PRS SE Series. This guitar features neck and bridge 85/15 \u201cS\u201d humbuckers with a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil \u201cS\u201d pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 single coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which add mass to the pickup helping to create a more powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, the configuration gives players an array of tones. The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special comes in Charcoal, Iri Blue, and Vintage Sunburst.\n\nBoth of these bolt-on guitars (the SE CE 24 and SE Swamp Ash Special) feature a new, ergonomic heel design, which is contoured for a comfortable playing experience higher up on the neck. \u201cWhen we were designing these guitars, I took an early prototype home and carved the heel by hand. The Engineering team here made some improvements and programed that shape for our partners at PT Cort. We think players will appreciate the ease of access this design brings,\u201d said Jack Higginbotham, COO.\n\nSE Custom 24 Quilt\n\n[Image 6]\n\nAlso joining the SE Series is the elevated SE Custom 24 Quilt. Featuring a quilted maple veneer and matching stained quilted maple headstock veneer, the SE Custom 24 Quilt is an elegant version of PRS\u2019s most popular model. This guitar also boasts an ebony fretboard with abalone bird inlays to complete the package. The color palette for the SE Custom 24 Quilt is: Black Gold Burst, Turquoise, and Violet.\n\nNew Colors\n\nFinally, PRS is known for its striking color options, and the SE Series is no exception. For 2024, Turquoise is making its way through the SE Series and will now be available on the following models: PRS SE Custom 24, SE Custom 24-08, SE Custom 24 \u201cLefty,\u201d SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and the SE Paul\u2019s Guitar. The Custom 24-08 is also adding Blood Orange to its assortment. And, finally, Charcoal will be offered on the SE McCarty 594, SE McCarty 594 Singlecut, and SE Paul\u2019s Guitar.\n\nFor the complete lineup, model specifications, and videos, please visit\u00a0\u301056\u2020www.p"

              "snippet": "\nThe Bolt-On range of guitars, as the name suggests, offers the same quality and features found in the Core line, but this time with a bolt-on neck. The most notable models in this series are the CE range, Silver Sky and Fiore. Again, these guitars are made in the Maryland factory.\u00a0\n\nAll the glitz and glamour of the Core and Bolt-on range not for you? Well, the S2 Series offers a stripped-down American-made instrument at a more affordable price.\u00a0These straightforward guitars also feature a variety of different pickup options not found on the Core line, as well as unique body shapes.\u00a0\n\nThe SE range - or Student Edition - first started way back in 2001 with the SE Santana and now includes a budget version of almost any PRS model you can think of. SE guitars for a time were manufactured by World Musical Instruments in Korea, but as of 2019 are - mostly - made in a designated SE factory in Surabaya, Indonesia.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have the private stock instruments. This is where you'll find the most exotic offerings from PRS. From the heaviest flamed tops to insane eye-catching finishes, these are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of PRS guitars - and well\u2026 the price reflects that. You have the option to customize your dream axe or pick up a great guitar that's already put together by one of the master luthiers.\u00a0\n\n### Does PRS make acoustic guitars?\n\nWhen it comes to his \u301078\u2020electric guitars\u3011, Paul Reed Smith is regarded as more than just a perfectionist, his driven character demands that he always goes one better. Nothing escapes his scrutiny \u2013 design, development, quality, aesthetics, tone, and playability are all up for improvement.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hardly surprising that when, around a decade ago, he finally got around to adding \u301079\u2020acoustic guitars\u3011 to the PRS catalog he dismissed conventional bracing systems for something more innovative. Something better. Something very Paul Reed Smith.\u00a0\n\nInspired by an old Torres nylon-string acoustic he developed a hybrid X/Classical bracing system that enabled the top to resonate as freely as possible. In addition, he locked the back and sides down so that, acoustically at least, they resembled a speaker cabinet that would provide enviable levels of projection. The result is a guitar that sings with both clarity and power.\u00a0\n\nJust like the PRS electrics, Paul\u2019s acoustics fall into different levels of build but there are currently only two: Private Stock Acoustics and SE Acoustics. As before, Private Stock is PRS\u2019 custom stock output, dream guitars made by artisan luthiers that demand sky-high prices. The SE range is built overseas and represents fantastic value for money, just like its namesake in the electric line.\n\nPRS currently builds only three acoustic body styles. The Angelus is a mid-sized cutaway that probably best exemplifies the benefits of Paul\u2019s hybrid X/Classical bracing system. It\u2019s available in a variety of different tonewoods but all are voiced to boast sparkly highs, a sweet mid-range, and a low end that\u2019s full of warmth and clarity. The Angelus is an amazing guitar for fingerstyle but has plenty of projection for flatpicking and loud strumming styles too. It\u2019s a fantastic do-it-all guitar.\n\nPRS\u2019 Tonare models are modestly sized jumbo-shaped guitars that offer more volume and midrange. Primarily, they\u2019re designed for strumming and flatpicking but can still sound pretty sweet in the hands of a good fingerpicker.\n\nFinally, the brand\u2019s parlor range takes the Tonare body shape and shrinks it. The result is a small guitar with much more depth and projection than you\u2019d expect.\n\nRead more on \u301080\u2020how we test gear and service at Guitar Player\u3011.\n\n## How we choose the products for our guides \n\nYou can trust Guitar Player.
