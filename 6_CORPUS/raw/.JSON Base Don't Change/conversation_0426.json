            "I'm sorry to hear you're facing difficulties with your Adderall prescription. Dealing with a shortage can be challenging, but there are steps you can take to avoid or minimize withdrawal symptoms:\n\n1. **Contact Your Prescribing Doctor**: They may be able to recommend alternatives or adjust your treatment plan. There are other stimulant and non-stimulant medications for ADHD that might be available, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) or non-stimulants like atomoxetine (Strattera).\n\n2. **Consider a Tapering Plan**: If you cannot access your medication, your doctor may suggest gradually reducing the dosage to minimize withdrawal symptoms rather than stopping abruptly.\n\n3. **Stay Hydrated and Eat Balanced Meals**: This can help your body adjust and manage any physical or emotional withdrawal symptoms like fatigue or irritability.\n\n4. **Manage Stress**: Engage in activities that help reduce stress and keep you focused, such as mindfulness exercises, meditation, or yoga.\n\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Physical activity can help maintain focus and manage symptoms while boosting mood and energy levels.\n\n6. **Get Enough Sleep**: Sleep disruptions can occur during withdrawal, so maintaining a consistent sleep schedule can help minimize the effects.\n\n7. **Use ADHD-Friendly Tools**: To help manage your ADHD symptoms during this time, rely on tools like timers, task management apps, or reminders to stay on track.\n\nIf withdrawal symptoms worsen or you're concerned, be sure to consult your healthcare provider immediately."

Some alternative versions of Adderall are readily available, such as certain long-acting formulas and generic forms, but there\u2019s not enough supply to meet U.S. market demand. \n\n The drug has been in short supply since Teva started experiencing a labor shortage in August, \u301039\u2020Bloomberg reported\u2020www.bloomberg.com\u3011. At least three other major manufacturers of Adderall are also experiencing backlogs. A \u301040\u2020survey\u2020ncpa.org\u3011 found that six in 10 community pharmacies had trouble supplying the drug in the beginning of August. \n\n##   Why Is There a Shortage? \n\n Nearly all of Teva\u2019s doses of its generic version of Adderall are on backorder, but its brand-name version is largely available. \n\n The FDA said the Teva shortage is partly due to an increase in demand for Adderall. Other manufacturers are also experiencing shortages, including Epic Pharma LLC, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP, and SpecGX LLC. \n\n But shortages like this one aren\u2019t unheard of, said Jeffrey Katz, PhD, a clinical psychologist based in Virginia and a member of the board of directors of the nonprofit Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). Drug manufacturers tend to see supply issues every few years, typically around the end of the year. \n\n Adderall contains the stimulant amphetamine, which is a highly regulated controlled substance. Each year, pharmaceutical companies must submit a request to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FDA for the raw material they plan to use for their Adderall production that year. Because amphetamines are controlled substances, there are strict rules barring companies from selling them to other companies. \n\n Given these restrictions, it can be challenging for manufacturers to create more product and for pharmacies to quickly pivot to carry new brands. \n\n A surge in demand for ADHD treatment may also be at play. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual classes meant many children missed opportunities to develop social and learning skills. Some adults went from a structured in-person work environment to the solitude of work-from-home. The effects of these changes, Katz said, were especially pronounced for people with ADHD. \n\n At the same time, a growing awareness of ADHD and the importance of seeking treatment for the condition seems to be causing more people to seek medication. And the rise of telehealth has made it easier for many to get a diagnosis and treatment. \n\n \u201cI do think people are more aware of ADHD and they\u2019re more willing in some ways to seek out some help, which is a good thing,\u201d Katz said. \n\n### More Resources of Managing ADHD\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to access routine medication, or are seeking information about how to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD, you can refer to resources from the National Resource Center for ADHD, a program primarily funded by the CDC and other government agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the program does not provide counseling, medical advice, or direct referrals to professionals who diagnose and treat ADHD.\n\n\u301041\u2020CHADD also runs an ADHD hotline\u2020chadd.org\u3011 with health information specialists in both English and Spanish. People can reach this hotline online or at 1-866-200-8098, Monday to Friday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. EST.\n\n##   What to Do If Your ADHD Medications Are in Short Supply \n\n It can be frustrating to hear that a pharmacist cannot fill a prescription for you or your child. If a pharmacy cannot fill an Adderall prescription, ask if they are able to partially fill it. That way, you can access some of the drug while figuring out if there is another pharmacy with the rest of the prescription in stock. \n\n Patients may also ask their providers about switching to a generic version that is more readily available than the brand-name Adderall. \n\n Since Adderall is a relatively short-acting drug, it doesn\u2019t take long for the body to adjust to a new dose, and it\u2019s unlikely that switching back to one\u2019s prior medication regimen will cause serious issues. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re changing your complete treatment response over a year because of a shortage now,\u201d Katz said. \u201cMaybe for a short time you\u2019re prescribed something different, and then you can get back on the regular medication that works best for you.\u201d \n\n The extended-release version of the drug is also widely available. People with ADHD, or parents of kids with ADHD, may speak with their clinician to find a way to best restructure their medication routine if they cannot reliably find their normal medication. \n\n Those struggling to access Adderall may also ask their provider to consider prescribing them Ritalin (methylphenidate) or one of its generic alternatives.  \n\n When changing a medication regimen for someone with ADHD, it can be important to be transparent about how those changes might influence an individual\u2019s behaviors. \n\n \u201cIf this youngster is doing well in school and they have to be",

            "Sam\u2019s Club pharmacies, like many others, are impacted by the ongoing nationwide shortage of Adderall, primarily due to manufacturing delays and increased demand for ADHD medications. However, it is possible that some pharmacies may have limited or partial availability of either the brand-name or generic versions of Adderall.\n\nIf you're struggling to fill your prescription at Sam\u2019s Club, it's advisable to call ahead to check availability. You can also ask your doctor about switching to a more readily available alternative, such as a generic form or an extended-release version, which might be easier to find during this shortage. Additionally, discussing other ADHD medications like Ritalin or non-stimulant options with your healthcare provider could be helpful while you wait for Adderall supplies to stabilize.\n\nFor further assistance, calling multiple pharmacies and asking if they can partially fill your prescription is a good short-term strategy\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011."

Experts say you can ask pharmacists to partially fill your order, or try a generic brand in the meantime.\n\n Adderall, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, is in \u301037\u2020short supply\u2020www.fda.gov\u3011.  \n\n While the supply of some generic versions could be restored this month, other inventory could be backlogged through January 2023, according to the \u301038\u2020Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2020www.accessdata.fda.gov\u3011. \n\n The FDA said that Teva, the largest maker of Adderall in the United States, is experiencing manufacturing delays. Some alternative versions of Adderall are readily available, such as certain long-acting formulas and generic forms, but there\u2019s not enough supply to meet U.S. market demand. \n\n The drug has been in short supply since Teva started experiencing a labor shortage in August, \u301039\u2020Bloomberg reported\u2020www.bloomberg.com\u3011. At least three other major manufacturers of Adderall are also experiencing backlogs. A \u301040\u2020survey\u2020ncpa.org\u3011 found that six in 10 community pharmacies had trouble supplying the drug in the beginning of August. \n\n##   Why Is There a Shortage? \n\n Nearly all of Teva\u2019s doses of its generic version of Adderall are on backorder, but its brand-name version is largely available. \n\n The FDA said the Teva shortage is partly due to an increase in demand for Adderall. Other manufacturers are also experiencing shortages, including Epic Pharma LLC, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP, and SpecGX LLC. \n\n But shortages like this one aren\u2019t unheard of, said Jeffrey Katz, PhD, a clinical psychologist based in Virginia and a member of the board of directors of the nonprofit Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). Drug manufacturers tend to see supply issues every few years, typically around the end of the year. \n\n Adderall contains the stimulant amphetamine, which is a highly regulated controlled substance. Each year, pharmaceutical companies must submit a request to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FDA for the raw material they plan to use for their Adderall production that year. Because amphetamines are controlled substances, there are strict rules barring companies from selling them to other companies. \n\n Given these restrictions, it can be challenging for manufacturers to create more product and for pharmacies to quickly pivot to carry new brands. \n\n A surge in demand for ADHD treatment may also be at play. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual classes meant many children missed opportunities to develop social and learning skills. Some adults went from a structured in-person work environment to the solitude of work-from-home. The effects of these changes, Katz said, were especially pronounced for people with ADHD. \n\n At the same time, a growing awareness of ADHD and the importance of seeking treatment for the condition seems to be causing more people to seek medication. And the rise of telehealth has made it easier for many to get a diagnosis and treatment. \n\n \u201cI do think people are more aware of ADHD and they\u2019re more willing in some ways to seek out some help, which is a good thing,\u201d Katz said. \n\n### More Resources of Managing ADHD\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to access routine medication, or are seeking information about how to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD, you can refer to resources from the National Resource Center for ADHD, a program primarily funded by the CDC and other government agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the program does not provide counseling, medical advice, or direct referrals to professionals who diagnose and treat ADHD.\n\n\u301041\u2020CHADD also runs an ADHD hotline\u2020chadd.org\u3011 with health information specialists in both English and Spanish. People can reach this hotline online or at 1-866-200-8098, Monday to Friday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. EST.\n\n##   What to Do If Your ADHD Medications Are in Short Supply \n\n It can be frustrating to hear that a pharmacist cannot fill a prescription for you or your child. If a pharmacy cannot fill an Adderall prescription, ask if they are able to partially fill it. That way, you can access some of the drug while figuring out if there is another pharmacy with the rest of the prescription in stock. \n\n Patients may also ask their providers about switching to a generic version that is more readily available than the brand-name Adderall. \n\n Since Adderall is a relatively short-acting drug, it doesn\u2019t take long for the body to adjust to a new dose, and it\u2019s unlikely that switching back to one\u2019s prior medication regimen will cause serious issues. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re changing your complete treatment response over a year because of a shortage now,\u201d Katz said. \u201cMaybe for a short time you\u2019re prescribed something different, and then you can get back on the regular medication that works best for you.\u201d \n\n The extended-release version of the drug is also widely available. People with ADHD, or parents of kids with ADHD, may speak with their clinician to find a way to best restructure their medication routine if they cannot reliably find their normal medication. \n\n Those struggling to access Adderall may also ask their provider to consider prescribing them Ritalin (methylphenidate) or one of its generic alternatives.  \n\n When changing a medication regimen for someone with ADHD, it can be important to be transparent about how those changes might influence an individual\u2019s behaviors. \n\n \u201cIf this youngster is doing well in school and they have to be",

Experts say you can ask pharmacists to partially fill your order, or try a generic brand in the meantime.\n\n Adderall, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, is in \u301037\u2020short supply\u2020www.fda.gov\u3011.  \n\n While the supply of some generic versions could be restored this month, other inventory could be backlogged through January 2023, according to the \u301038\u2020Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2020www.accessdata.fda.gov\u3011. \n\n The FDA said that Teva, the largest maker of Adderall in the United States, is experiencing manufacturing delays. Some alternative versions of Adderall are readily available, such as certain long-acting formulas and generic forms, but there\u2019s not enough supply to meet U.S. market demand. \n\n The drug has been in short supply since Teva started experiencing a labor shortage in August, \u301039\u2020Bloomberg reported\u2020www.bloomberg.com\u3011. At least three other major manufacturers of Adderall are also experiencing backlogs. A \u301040\u2020survey\u2020ncpa.org\u3011 found that six in 10 community pharmacies had trouble supplying the drug in the beginning of August. \n\n##   Why Is There a Shortage? \n\n Nearly all of Teva\u2019s doses of its generic version of Adderall are on backorder, but its brand-name version is largely available. \n\n The FDA said the Teva shortage is partly due to an increase in demand for Adderall. Other manufacturers are also experiencing shortages, including Epic Pharma LLC, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP, and SpecGX LLC. \n\n But shortages like this one aren\u2019t unheard of, said Jeffrey Katz, PhD, a clinical psychologist based in Virginia and a member of the board of directors of the nonprofit Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). Drug manufacturers tend to see supply issues every few years, typically around the end of the year. \n\n Adderall contains the stimulant amphetamine, which is a highly regulated controlled substance. Each year, pharmaceutical companies must submit a request to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FDA for the raw material they plan to use for their Adderall production that year. Because amphetamines are controlled substances, there are strict rules barring companies from selling them to other companies. \n\n Given these restrictions, it can be challenging for manufacturers to create more product and for pharmacies to quickly pivot to carry new brands. \n\n A surge in demand for ADHD treatment may also be at play. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual classes meant many children missed opportunities to develop social and learning skills. Some adults went from a structured in-person work environment to the solitude of work-from-home. The effects of these changes, Katz said, were especially pronounced for people with ADHD. \n\n At the same time, a growing awareness of ADHD and the importance of seeking treatment for the condition seems to be causing more people to seek medication. And the rise of telehealth has made it easier for many to get a diagnosis and treatment. \n\n \u201cI do think people are more aware of ADHD and they\u2019re more willing in some ways to seek out some help, which is a good thing,\u201d Katz said. \n\n### More Resources of Managing ADHD\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to access routine medication, or are seeking information about how to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD, you can refer to resources from the National Resource Center for ADHD, a program primarily funded by the CDC and other government agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the program does not provide counseling, medical advice, or direct referrals to professionals who diagnose and treat ADHD.\n\n\u301041\u2020CHADD also runs an ADHD hotline\u2020chadd.org\u3011 with health information specialists in both English and Spanish.

            "If you're unable to get Adderall due to the shortage, several alternative medications may work for managing ADHD. Here are some options, categorized into stimulant and non-stimulant medications:\n\n### Stimulants (Similar to Adderall)\n1. **Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Metadate)**: These are some of the most common alternatives to Adderall. They are also stimulant medications but with a different active ingredient. Extended-release versions like **Concerta** provide longer-lasting effects throughout the day.\n2. **Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)**: This is another stimulant that works similarly to methylphenidate but is more targeted in its effects.\n3. **Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)**: This medication is an extended-release stimulant, often used when a longer effect is needed or to avoid multiple doses throughout the day.\n4. **Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Zenzedi)**: Another amphetamine-based stimulant similar to Adderall, but it may be more available during the shortage.\n\n### Non-Stimulants (If Stimulants Aren't Suitable)\n1. **Atomoxetine (Strattera)**: A non-stimulant medication that is often used as a long-term treatment option for ADHD. It can take a few weeks to become fully effective.\n2. **Guanfacine (Intuniv)**: This medication is often used as an adjunct to stimulants but can also be used alone for managing ADHD symptoms.\n3. **Clonidine (Kapvay)**: Another non-stimulant, Clonidine can help reduce ADHD symptoms, especially hyperactivity and impulsivity. It is sometimes used alongside stimulant medications.\n\nYour healthcare provider will be able to assess which alternative is the best fit based on your needs and medical history\u30109\u2020source\u3011."

Because amphetamines are controlled substances, there are strict rules barring companies from selling them to other companies. \n\n Given these restrictions, it can be challenging for manufacturers to create more product and for pharmacies to quickly pivot to carry new brands. \n\n A surge in demand for ADHD treatment may also be at play. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual classes meant many children missed opportunities to develop social and learning skills. Some adults went from a structured in-person work environment to the solitude of work-from-home. The effects of these changes, Katz said, were especially pronounced for people with ADHD. \n\n At the same time, a growing awareness of ADHD and the importance of seeking treatment for the condition seems to be causing more people to seek medication. And the rise of telehealth has made it easier for many to get a diagnosis and treatment. \n\n \u201cI do think people are more aware of ADHD and they\u2019re more willing in some ways to seek out some help, which is a good thing,\u201d Katz said. \n\n### More Resources of Managing ADHD\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to access routine medication, or are seeking information about how to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD, you can refer to resources from the National Resource Center for ADHD, a program primarily funded by the CDC and other government agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the program does not provide counseling, medical advice, or direct referrals to professionals who diagnose and treat ADHD.\n\n\u301041\u2020CHADD also runs an ADHD hotline\u2020chadd.org\u3011 with health information specialists in both English and Spanish.

If a pharmacy cannot fill an Adderall prescription, ask if they are able to partially fill it. That way, you can access some of the drug while figuring out if there is another pharmacy with the rest of the prescription in stock. \n\n Patients may also ask their providers about switching to a generic version that is more readily available than the brand-name Adderall. \n\n Since Adderall is a relatively short-acting drug, it doesn\u2019t take long for the body to adjust to a new dose, and it\u2019s unlikely that switching back to one\u2019s prior medication regimen will cause serious issues. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re changing your complete treatment response over a year because of a shortage now,\u201d Katz said. \u201cMaybe for a short time you\u2019re prescribed something different, and then you can get back on the regular medication that works best for you.\u201d \n\n The extended-release version of the drug is also widely available. People with ADHD, or parents of kids with ADHD, may speak with their clinician to find a way to best restructure their medication routine if they cannot reliably find their normal medication. \n\n Those struggling to access Adderall may also ask their provider to consider prescribing them Ritalin (methylphenidate) or one of its generic alternatives.  \n\n When changing a medication regimen for someone with ADHD, it can be important to be transparent about how those changes might influence an individual\u2019s behaviors. \n\n \u201cIf this youngster is doing well in school and they have to be",

Experts say you can ask pharmacists to partially fill your order, or try a generic brand in the meantime.\n\n Adderall, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, is in \u301037\u2020short supply\u2020www.fda.gov\u3011.  \n\n While the supply of some generic versions could be restored this month, other inventory could be backlogged through January 2023, according to the \u301038\u2020Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2020www.accessdata.fda.gov\u3011. \n\n The FDA said that Teva, the largest maker of Adderall in the United States, is experiencing manufacturing delays. Some alternative versions of Adderall are readily available, such as certain long-acting formulas and generic forms, but there\u2019s not enough supply to meet U.S. market demand. \n\n The drug has been in short supply since Teva started experiencing a labor shortage in August, \u301039\u2020Bloomberg reported\u2020www.bloomberg.com\u3011. At least three other major manufacturers of Adderall are also experiencing backlogs. A \u301040\u2020survey\u2020ncpa.org\u3011 found that six in 10 community pharmacies had trouble supplying the drug in the beginning of August. \n\n##   Why Is There a Shortage? \n\n Nearly all of Teva\u2019s doses of its generic version of Adderall are on backorder, but its brand-name version is largely available. \n\n The FDA said the Teva shortage is partly due to an increase in demand for Adderall. Other manufacturers are also experiencing shortages, including Epic Pharma LLC, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP, and SpecGX LLC. \n\n But shortages like this one aren\u2019t unheard of, said Jeffrey Katz, PhD, a clinical psychologist based in Virginia and a member of the board of directors of the nonprofit Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD).
