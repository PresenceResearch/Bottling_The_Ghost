Take a look at the FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) document:\u00a0\u301031\u2020FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program FAQs\u3011\n\nProgram Purpose: The Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) FY25 Maryland\u00a0Solar Access Program will be provided to help eligible Maryland residents install solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to power their homes with clean, affordable, and sustainable energy. This program was established as the \u201cCustomer-sited Solar Grant Program\u201d by the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s passage of \u301032\u20202024 S.B. 783\u2020mgaleg.maryland.gov\u3011, known as the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024,\u00a0and it will improve access to the benefits of solar energy to help ensure that no Marylander is left behind in the clean energy transition. This program will ultimately replace the previous MEA Residential Clean Energy Rebate Program, and will help deliver more equitable solar incentives to Marylanders.  \n\nProgram Description: The Maryland\u00a0Solar Access Program will be offered to Maryland residents on a first-come, first-served basis, that meet the Program\u2019s income requirements. Full income and eligibility requirements will be provided in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), which will be published later this calendar year. As required by statute, the application process will occur in two (2) steps, further described in the \u201cType of Program\u201d section below.  \n\nType of Program: The FY25 MEA Maryland\u00a0Solar Access Program will be a non-competitive program with awards made on a first-come, first-served basis. The application process will consist of two (2) steps: (1) an initial application to reserve funds; and (2) solar installation completion verification. Applicants will have 180 days from the date that they receive confirmation of reserved funds to have the solar system fully-installed and operational, in order to receive payment of the funds. This is a statutory requirement of the program.  \n\nProgram Documents: The\u00a0\u301031\u2020FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program FAQ Document\u3011\u00a0provides answers to frequently-asked questions about the Program. The Maryland\u00a0Solar Access Program FOA is not yet available, but will be posted later this calendar year. Soon, MEA will post a Notice of Intent and Request for Information (NOI-RFI) that will provide basic program design information, as well as seek\u00a0feedback from Maryland residents, solar installers, and other stakeholders in the residential solar space to help inform the ultimate\u00a0design of the new Maryland\u00a0Solar Access Program.  \n\nProgram Contact: For more information on this upcoming MEA funding opportunity, please contact Brandon Bowser; Section Chief, Clean Energy and Resilience.

The application process will consist of two (2) steps: (1) an initial application to reserve funds; and (2) solar installation completion verification. Applicants will have 180 days from the date that they receive confirmation of reserved funds to have the solar system fully-installed and operational, in order to receive payment of the funds. This is a statutory requirement of the program.  \n\nProgram Documents: The\u00a0\u301031\u2020FY25 Maryland Solar Access Program FAQ Document\u3011\u00a0provides answers to frequently-asked questions about the Program.

            "To find a list of veteran-owned businesses in Maryland, a few online directories and state resources can help you locate businesses certified as Veteran-Owned (VOB) or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB):\n\n1. **Veteran Owned Business Directory**: This nationwide directory includes Maryland-based veteran-owned businesses and can be filtered by industry and location. It\u2019s a widely used resource for locating veteran-owned enterprises, including active duty, reservists, and service-disabled veteran business owners. You can explore this directory at [VeteranOwnedBusiness.com](https://www.veteranownedbusiness.com).\n\n2. **Maryland Department of Commerce Veteran-Owned Programs**: The Maryland Veteran-Owned Small Business Enterprise (VSBE) Program provides procurement and contracting opportunities with state agencies, which could be a good indicator of veteran-owned businesses actively engaged with the state. Learn more about their initiatives [here](https://veterans.maryland.gov).\n\n3. **Maryland Small Business Development Center (SBDC)**: The SBDC also supports veteran-owned businesses in Maryland, offering resources and guidance for growth and procurement opportunities, particularly for those participating in Maryland\u2019s VSBE program.\n\nThese resources provide both direct business listings and support for identifying veteran-owned businesses across Maryland."

            "A downloadable Excel spreadsheet of Maryland veteran-owned businesses isn\u2019t typically available directly online. However, here\u2019s how you can get or create one:\n\n1. **Veteran Owned Business Directory**: On [VeteranOwnedBusiness.com](https://www.veteranownedbusiness.com), you can search for Maryland-based businesses and export the data manually if needed. This directory doesn\u2019t offer direct Excel downloads, but you can copy entries into a spreadsheet. Additionally, you can contact their support to see if they can provide a larger dataset.\n\n2. **Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Database**: MDOT\u2019s Office of Minority Business Enterprise maintains a searchable directory of certified businesses, including veteran-owned companies. You can use the **eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA)** platform to access listings and possibly request data downloads from MDOT. Visit [MDOT\u2019s directory here](https://marylandmdbe.mdot.maryland.gov).\n\n3. **eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA)**: This is Maryland's procurement platform where registered vendors, including veteran-owned businesses, are listed. You can contact eMMA\u2019s support to inquire about obtaining data in Excel format if needed.\n\n4. **Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs**: They may also have resources or contacts who can provide data for veteran-owned businesses actively registered in Maryland. Their site for small business resources is [veterans.maryland.gov](https://veterans.maryland.gov).\n\nAlternatively, if you need help with creating a list from an existing source, I can assist with formatting once you have gathered data!"
