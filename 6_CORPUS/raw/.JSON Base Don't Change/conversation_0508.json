This is Amber. Im, just using Robins Zoom account to join the meeting. \n\n\n\n0:06 | Mark\n\nGot it. Good morning. Its been that kind of day. Good afternoon. Yeah, good afternoon. Where are you? Are you guys in Baltimore County? \n\n\n\n0:16 | Robin\n\nNo, its just one of our property we just acquired last month, but we actually based in New York. Oh, \n\n\n\n0:26 | Mark\n\nAre you in the city? \n\n\n\n0:28 | Robin\n\nYes. \n\n\n\n0:30 | Mark\n\nI love it. Where are you in the city? \n\n\n\n0:32 | Robin\n\nIn Midtown? \n\n\n\n0:35 | Mark\n\nWow. Okay. My wife is a Broadway musician, So, I have been, I spend a lot of time in New York because she plays in the shows. Oh, nice. Yeah. \n\n\n\n0:53 | Robin\n\nWe are not very far from the Broadway. \n\n\n\n0:57 | Mark\n\nYeah. If youre, Midtown, youre, close, How far are you from Times Square? \n\n\n\n1:01 | Robin\n\nTimes Square is like six, seven blocks away. \n\n\n\n1:07 | Mark\n\nWell, she says that, between Thanksgiving and New Year, like shell work at a theater, like on Fifteenth Street, and itll take 20 minutes to get from the subway station to the theater, because there are so many tourists. \n\n\n\n1:27 | Robin\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Because like I remember before Thanksgiving, like Rockefeller Plaza will have like a huge Christmas tree, And also, right across the street, the sixth, fifth avenue will have the, like. \n\n\n\n1:44 | Mark\n\nAh, the windows. \n\n\n\n1:46 | Robin\n\nYeah. So, so there will be bunch of people around there. \n\n\n\n1:49 | Mark\n\nOh, yeah. Its its, and, they stand in the middle of the intersections so they can, so they can take pictures of everything. Yeah, especially at. \n\n\n\n2:00 | Robin\n\nLike after four 30 because I remember the light show will begin like at every day, after four 30 or five. So, people will just like wait there to like take photos of the light show and the trees together. Yeah. \n\n\n\n2:15 | Mark\n\nNew York, is gonna get, I just remember its always tough, between now and the end of the year. So, anyway, so weve got about a half an hour. Im, really glad, you reached out to us, give you a quick 10 second about who I am, and what we do. Ive, been doing this in Baltimore, D, C, Philadelphia, roughly for About 15 years. I live in Baltimore County, not very close to the proposed property, but I could probably get there in 20 25 minutes as needed. So, thats always a little helpful. We are Lumina, is, were an installer, we also, find, and fund projects with some partners. And so, whatever it is youre, looking to do, we should probably be able to work with you on it. And if not, for some reason, I could probably steer you in the direction of some people that could, so really, today, my thought is just tell me what I can do for you, tell me what youre, looking for, tell me how I can help and well, go through a few questions and that should probably dictate how we take it from here. \n\n\n\n3:37 | Robin\n\nOkay. Yeah, sure. So, do you want me to briefly introduce, what we are looking for? \n\n\n\n3:45 | Mark\n\nYep. Thats a great way to start? \n\n\n\n3:47 | Robin\n\nYeah. So, we recently got this, multi family apartment community, and theres, there are about, 20 20 buildings, in total and, the reason we are looking for at grid type solar panels on the roof is because like, we are trying to see if its, doable and, efficient to, covered the electricity bills by adding the solar panels on the roof. \n\n\n\n4:21 | Mark\n\nCan you give me the address again? I know I have it somewhere so I can look at it on Google Maps and take a look at what the roofs look like. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Robin\n\nLet me address and copy. \n\n\n\n4:44 | Robin\n\nI will just copy the address in the chat box. Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, Our property manager is Donaldsons. \n\n\n\n6:41 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thank you. Yeah, thats always good for me. Good to know. All right. So then youre looking to save money on the electric bill. So, does that mean that these buildings are metered in such a way that you pay the electric bill for the tenants? \n\n\n\n7:01 | Robin\n\nYeah. The tenants, the rents that pay by tenants are included with utility costs. Yeah, Which means that were paying for all the utility costs. \n\n\n\n7:11 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Understood. All right. So, these 20 buildings here, how are they metered? Right? How does BG, E, how many meters, I suppose is, what Im really looking to ask on these buildings? \n\n\n\n7:30 | Robin\n\nI think we have two meters probably, but I have to get back to you on that one though. Yeah, because Ill have to answer once my partner send it over with the past 12 months, electrical bills? \n\n\n\n7:44 | Mark\n\nYep. Okay. So, all right. So theres two meters and Ill, probably if I can figure out where they are, that will help me a lot because obviously were going to need to get the power from the roof to the meter. And I dont know the property that well. So I cant really give you any insight into that. Okay? So you pay the electric bill, you own the buildings, the tenants have the electric bill included in their rent. These roofs, a lot of them look new. Some of them look like they need some work. And then obviously, we have some trees that are shading some of the properties as well. Do you want me to focus on sort of, you know, like the low hanging fruit, what we can install, you know, tomorrow if we needed to, or are you going to explore fixing or replacing some of these roofs? \n\n\n\n8:44 | Robin\n\nWell, our team havent decided on that first because we are just were still in the were still in the transaction period between the last owner and ours. Yeah, we are still in this kind of grace period. So we have to, yeah, that answer. I have to get back to you on that one. Yeah. \n\n\n\n9:05 | Mark\n\nUnderstood. Okay. So in terms of installation, any, just double check any installation that any surface that works is okay to install on, correct. Right? Okay. I guess the next big question is who do you want to own this system? Do you want to buy it? Do you want to lease it? What is your strategy for this? \n\n\n\n9:30 | Robin\n\nWhen you talk about lease, are you talking about financing or just like car lease or something like that? \n\n\n\n9:36 | Mark\n\nOkay. So first option for you is going to be buying it outright, Right? You, you spend the money, the panels go on the roof. These panels are essentially an investment for you, Right? You know, I can run a pro forma, show you what the tax credits are, show you, what the payback period is, what your IRR is going to be. And all of those financial, you guys are, you folks are money people, you know this better than me. So whatever your investment hurdle is, whatever makes sense for you in terms of how you use your capital, I would give you that number, so you could decide if this was an investment worth putting your money into. The question. Is theres a third party that comes in, the third party owns the system. They take advantage of all the incentives. So the incentives that would normally go to you during the process, go to them. The solar on the roof produces electricity. It powers the buildings just like it would if you own it. But the people that own the system, Well, charge you a reduced rate for the electricity. \n\n\n\n10:54 | Robin\n\nGot it. Yeah, I dont think, I think Ill, probably will stick to that. We, as the owner of the equipment. So you want to buy it. Yeah. \n\n\n\n11:03 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thats that is easier. Actually. All right. So basically, Im trying to understand really what youre looking for here is you want to get the electric bill as low as you can, Right? Exactly. I will tell you that, Im guessing the electric bill here is pretty substantial. And as I look at the roof, I, you know, I can tell you right now, youre not going to be able to eliminate all of it, You know, with this project still being viable, if you could eliminate, you know? \n\n\n\n11:41 | Robin\n\nOkay. Got it. \n\n\n\n11:44 | Mark\n\nWell, thats a question. Do you think that it will be worth your time? Or is that not enough to really make you interested? \n\n\n\n11:53 | Robin\n\nI mean, I have to try to balance out the payment for the equipment and how like whats the real saving for us? Because I, we are not expert here you are. So I have to figure out, yeah, I have to look at the numbers and try to see if that makes sense Because its kind of hard for me to decide it right now. \n\n\n\n12:18 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Basically, a lot of times people will expect the solar to just completely eliminate the bill And I asked that question up front to temper expectations. Yeah. \n\n\n\n12:31 | Robin\n\nSo we have the expectation that it might not be able to eliminate all the usage, but thats fine with us Just trying to see if the number makes sense? \n\n\n\n12:41 | Mark\n\nMaking sure, making sure that all makes sense. So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n\nWe have, we have one, two partners that, we have to like, we have to all agree on this decisions, but, they are all aware of this solar installation solutions. So, we just need to go back to them with the numbers and well, figure it out pretty quick. \n\n\n\n13:09 | Mark\n\nThat, that makes my life easy. And then it goes through there, Its contracting. Now, have you done solar on any other property or is this your first time? \n\n\n\n13:23 | Robin\n\nThis is our first time, actually. So thats why. \n\n\n\n13:26 | Mark\n\nOh, excellent. Where do you own properties? Because I can tell you if you own them in certain markets, theyre more lucrative than in other markets. So, for example, if you own properties in Washington, DC, your return is going to be double if not triple a system in Maryland. \n\n\n\n13:44 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think our partner has probably, probably on DC, but, like we are not always a partner on every product. Yeah. So, our investment, prior to this product, the property, it was, basically in Texas or North Carolina, someplace like that. Yeah. And Maryland, this is our first time doing investment there, So. \n\n\n\n14:10 | Mark\n\nGreat. Well, welcome to Maryland. Were very nice here and, were going to take care of you. Great. All right. So, heres what I would propose, You need to see some numbers. I need to get some information from you. Yes. Obviously, I need to get some electric bills, Right? If you could send those to me, 12 months is always good. Mm, hmm. And then I can put those into my models and look at what youre, paying, Look at what youre using. And then basically, from that information, I can tell you what well be able to, what solar will be able to do for you. Got it. I will design the buildings that if we did the project tomorrow, the site would be viable. And Im, looking at the site and it looks like we are, it looks like about half of them are good. I see some, like I said, the roofs are beautiful, brand new, And I see some that, you know, they probably look like they have about, You know, 10 ish years left on the warranty. And so thats really going to be your decision. Ill, show you what it looks like. But ultimately, youre, going to need to make that call. Okay. Yeah. So, and then really, I need to know where the meters are, because, for example, you know, Im, looking all the way back on this cul, de sac, This is going to be prime territory here. Im, going to use every single one of these buildings. And if the meter is at, for example, the front of the complex, its going to cost a good amount of money to get the power from the front or from the back, all the way to the front. And I can tell you thats probably going to be one of the bigger expenses, in this, in this project. So, if you have someone on site and if they could take this map and show me where some of these meters are. That would, that would help me in? \n\n\n\n16:16 | Robin\n\nA little bit. Got it. Great. \n\n\n\n16:20 | Mark\n\nAnd just, I ask these questions all the time. Assuming Im, assuming that you can take a tax credit on this. Mm. Hmm. Okay. A lot of, some people will own properties and lose money on them. And so, want to make sure that thats not the case here. Im, going to look one thing up before I let you go. There are certain incentives in place for different communities. Im, going to look here and see if, this would qualify. Let me ask you this too. Is this low income? \n\n\n\n17:00 | Robin\n\nIts not technically classified as a low income properties, but our tenant are essentially like low income tenant. Okay. Yeah, But we didnt go through the whole process of applying this property to be recognized as low income properties. \n\n\n\n17:18 | Mark\n\nThere are some, there are some incentives available if you are, if you are a low income property, but we can look into that. Down the road. What Im trying to do is just get an idea of whats available for you. And what all of this would look like, you know, in a final package. So, if you bear with me one second, Im going to look up one more thing. This is in an area of Baltimore County that Could qualify. Oh, it is, doesnt look like it, Oh, its right next to it. So, Baltimore County down, that area used to have a big, coal plant, and sometimes that properties near, coal plants get an extra bump in the tax credit and you are literally four miles away from that. So\u2026 Oh, thats too bad. Well, well, well, get them next time. Okay? What is, so, youre, still in the, youre, still in the transactional phase right now. So, can you walk me through what a timeline would look like for you internally? \n\n\n\n18:37 | Robin\n\nI was going to say this like, were planning on, how long do you think the permit will take? Are you guys taking care of the world permit? If we choose to go that path\u2026 Say that one more time? Please? Are you guys responsible for all the permitting, for the solar installation? \n\n\n\n18:53 | Mark\n\nCorrect. We are turnkey. Got it. \n\n\n\n18:56 | Robin\n\nHow much time do you think, the, about applying for permit? \n\n\n\n19:02 | Mark\n\nJust confirm this is Baltimore County, right? Not Baltimore City. Yeah, Baltimore County. Yeah. Right. That is going to depend, say, like four to six weeks for example. But because weve got all these different structures, Im gonna say, were gonna need to pull multiple permits because each of these are a separate address, correct? Correct? \n\n\n\n19:28 | Robin\n\nRight. Yeah. \n\n\n\n19:30 | Mark\n\nSo, we will likely need to pull multiple permits, but Baltimore County is good for solar. Been doing solar in Baltimore County a really long time. So, its not terrible. And then the interconnection which is, you know, youve never done this before. So, we basically have two hurdles we need to, clear before we can build. The first is the permit through the AHJ. So here, its gonna be Baltimore County. And the second is going to be, The utility company, the utility company, needs to grant us permission to include, to basically plug it into their grid. And sometimes they take time, Sometimes they take time because they need to conduct studies, and make sure that everything thats being done is safe. So that can take two weeks, That can take up to two months. It really depends on what the infrastructure looks like there. So generally, what I do in situations like this is if the numbers work for you, if the project looks good. You know, well, start the process of permitting and interconnection and designing, And sort of get that process started. And then if everything works out, we would sign the final agreement when we had the, the specs and the final pricing and, basically permission to install, Got it. Thats really how that goes. I mean, and that could go a couple of months. So, if youre, looking, if youre looking to do this next year, you know, we could probably go through the analysis before the end of this year. And if you like what you see, we could probably get rolling on, you know, getting on site and starting the permit process, end of the year, early 20 25. \n\n\n\n21:25 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think thats all that matches our initial thought, like started on early 20 25 and we will see, well, go from there. \n\n\n\n21:34 | Mark\n\nOkay. All right. So anything I can answer for you? Did we leave anything out? \n\n\n\n21:44 | Robin\n\nCould you repeat again, like besides of the 12 months, electrical bill, is there anything else or do you need for us right now? \n\n\n\n21:54 | Mark\n\nThe 12 month electric bill will get me started. Okay? And if you could, and Ill, see if I can find a utility map online that shows me where everything plugs in. If you could get me in touch with the property manager. \n\n\n\n22:14 | Robin\n\nGot it. Okay. All right. Ill, keep that in mind. \n\n\n\n22:17 | Mark\n\nYeah, Because what Ill need to do? I mean, I can give you a price for this. But if I dont know where Im, plugging it in, that price is going to potentially be really inaccurate. \n\n\n\n22:26 | Robin\n\nGot it. Thank you. \n\n\n\n22:28 | Mark\n\nMy pleasure. And then if I get you some numbers, you say, you know, what this is something we can do, Then we move forward and we all get our hands a little dirty. We go on site. We look at the structural, we look at the electrical, you know, you dont know if theres going to be some upgrades necessary. You know, we may find roofs that need work, but thats all after you basically look at the numbers and say this hurdles, this is an investment we want to make And you want to work with me? \n\n\n\n23:01 | Mark\n\nGreat. Sounds great. Okay. Yeah. Who do I, who do I work with? Moving forward from here? Is it you, Robin or\u2026 anyone else on your team? \n\n\n\n23:15 | Robin\n\nI think at a very early stage, you can just talk directly to me and Amber. And after that, if you want to go on site and, like I said, after we signed those agreements and move forward, we probably will arrange you with one of our local partner there. Itll be much easier for you and him to talk about this because he will be, probably, he live very close to the property. \n\n\n\n23:41 | Mark\n\nThats great. Our office by the way is super close to this. Its, yeah, were 20 minutes from this, which is great. We would be a lot closer if a great big boat didnt break the key bridge like literally. \n\n\n\n24:02 | Robin\n\nYeah, I remember that. \n\n\n\n24:04 | Mark\n\nYeah. We could probably get there in like 15 minutes if that bridge was open, but we have to go all the way around. So its gonna take a little longer, But it doesnt its really close to our office, which is what Im trying to say. \n\n\n\n24:14 | Robin\n\nNice. Thats so cool. Yeah. Okay. \n\n\n\n24:21 | Mark\n\nThats all I have folks. All right. Ill start some designs, send me over the bills. Give me some time, then we can schedule a man. I wish I could make an excuse to come up to your office and present in person. That would be a lot of fun, but I dont think theyre gonna pay for that so well have to do another Zoom, But I should have something out to you end of next week if that sounds good. \n\n\n\n24:46 | Robin\n\nThat sounds perfect. All right. Thank you for your time today. \n\n\n\n24:51 | Mark\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you all very much. \n\n\n\n24:53 | Robin\n\nHave a great weekend. \n\n\n\n24:54 | Mark\n\nOkay. You too. Bye bye.",

            "Here's an analysis of how well Mark\u2019s call aligns with the Discovery Call Template (MEDPICC framework):\n\n### 1. **Introduction**\n   - **Greeting and Rapport**: Mark established a friendly connection early on, sharing some personal anecdotes about New York, which aligns well with the rapport-building goal.\n   - **Introduction to Lumina Solar**: Mark introduced himself and briefly mentioned his work with Lumina Solar, although it was a bit casual compared to the template's more structured introduction.\n   - **Purpose and Agenda**: Mark didn\u2019t set a clear agenda for the call but did mention they\u2019d go through a few questions, which gave a general direction but lacked the structured approach in the template.\n\n### 2. **Rapport Building**\n   - **Personal Connection**: Mark successfully connected personally, talking about New York and his wife\u2019s job as a musician. This aligned with the template's suggestion to build rapport and was effective in creating a relaxed atmosphere.\n   - **Business-Specific Questions**: Mark did not explicitly ask about challenges related to recent energy market changes, which could have been insightful and relevant to the conversation.\n\n### 3. **Exploration and Discovery (MEDPICC Framework)**\n   - **Metrics (M)**: Mark discussed electricity bills and installation logistics but missed probing deeper into specific financial goals, such as expected cost savings or operational efficiencies. The conversation lacked questions about specific metrics for energy savings.\n   - **Economic Buyer (E)**: Mark identified who within the company would influence the decision but didn\u2019t inquire further about the priorities of these decision-makers (like ROI or long-term savings), which would align with the template.\n   - **Decision Criteria (D)**: He addressed some decision-making factors (e.g., system ownership vs. third-party ownership), but the discussion could have included benchmarks or KPIs the client might be using to evaluate solar providers.\n   - **Decision Process (D)**: Mark briefly asked about the timeline, but a more structured approach to understanding the entire decision-making and approval process would have helped, especially with a first-time solar buyer.\n   - **Paper Process (P)**: Permitting was discussed, but Mark didn\u2019t probe further into specific contractual requirements or procurement policies, which the template suggests to assess legal and logistical obstacles.\n   - **Identify Pain (I)**: Mark explored the client\u2019s goals of reducing electricity costs but missed deeper questions about long-term impacts if these energy challenges remain unaddressed, which might have built urgency.\n   - **Champion (C)**: No specific champion was identified. Asking about internal advocates could reveal a potential ally within the client\u2019s organization.\n   - **Competition (C)**: Mark did not inquire if they were evaluating other solar providers or energy solutions, which would give insights into the competition and help tailor the value proposition.\n\n### 4. **Suitability and Financial Considerations**\n   - **Site Suitability**: Mark did discuss roof conditions, potential shading issues, and meter locations, aligning well with the suitability questions in the template.\n   - **Investment Model**: Mark effectively explained the pros and cons of ownership vs. third-party ownership, a key component in understanding client preferences.\n\n### 5. **Next Steps and Confirmation**\n   - **Recap Key Insights**: Mark missed summarizing the main insights uncovered during the conversation. A recap could have reinforced key points and clarified any misunderstandings.\n   - **Propose Next Steps**: He outlined follow-up steps, such as providing 12 months of utility data and connecting with the property manager. This approach aligns with the template but could have been clearer if framed as \u201cnext steps.\u201d\n   - **Confirm Timeline**: Mark mentioned a tentative timeline but didn\u2019t propose a specific follow-up meeting date, which would help solidify commitment and clarity.\n\n### 6. **Closing**\n   - **Thank You and Enthusiasm**: Mark ended the call with gratitude and positivity, though he missed reiterating Lumina Solar\u2019s commitment to providing the best solution for their needs, which would reinforce confidence in Lumina\u2019s dedication.\n\n### **Summary**\n- **What Mark Did Well**: He effectively built rapport, explained ownership options, addressed site suitability, and outlined follow-up steps.\n- **Areas for Improvement**: Mark could enhance his approach by setting a clear agenda, exploring deeper discovery questions (metrics, economic buyer priorities, decision criteria, competition), and providing a structured recap and confirmation of next steps. Following the template more closely would strengthen the clarity and thoroughness of the discovery process, potentially uncovering deeper insights into the client\u2019s needs and decision-making process."

Is it Shane? Yes. Nice to meet you. \n\n\n\n0:09 | Shane\n\nAll right. Nice to meet you. Glad you could take a little time. So in general, just to get started, you know, what do you do with the wider circle and what sort of, you know, the mission? I think I have an idea, you know, having researched the company and everything, but. \n\n\n\n0:29 | Myia\n\nYeah, so we just help those in need. We have a couple different programs. We have a furniture assistant program that also includes special appointments for babies. We have a PDC, which is professional clothing. We provide clothing to those that might need it. We also have a career development program that's really good at just providing like job fairs and just helping and coaching those who might be looking for work. And we also have a volunteer team, which is really great. We have volunteers almost here every day, just, you know, helping us with our daily operations. So it's just really nice to just have that support team give back in multiple different ways than one, you know, and it's really all it's about. We've been at this location ever since 2000, I believe we've been at this location ever since 2008, but we've been running for ever since 2001. We took ownership of this building in 2016 And then we installed the new roof in 20 21. \n\n\n\n1:36 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. Look at you just knocking out questions as you know I was going to ask anyway. Well that's good. I mean it's you know it's really important and as you were to potentially look at any sort of investment you know the roof span the lifespan is it's usually important and having only been a few years old you know the life expectancy of the roof and solar you know co align here very well so that's very good to know. So good and And sort of what is your role? \n\n\n\n2:10 | Myia\n\nMy role, I'm the operations manager. Okay. This is my new role so usually I just go around and I make sure you know the operations is up and running everything's going good at the facility and just also looking for any improvements you know that can be also add on to a wider circle. Okay, good. \n\n\n\n2:27 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. And then, you know, sort of before we get started into the questions that I'll have but. \n\n\n\n2:35 | Myia\n\nJust obviously, \n\n\n\n2:35 | Shane\n\nwe reached out to you, but typically, people respond having some background of solar or is this something that you guys have looked at previously? You know, what sort of things led, you know, to sit down with me today? \n\n\n\n2:50 | Myia\n\nWe're just something that we're considering. We know that it could probably help out with the PEPCO bill depending on how much of the savings analysis and I do know that there's just the savings incentives. We also believe, it's a possibility that we might be on a DC grid as well. So that's also that. So I don't know if the SRECs would come into play with that or it's, yeah, so... \n\n\n\n3:20 | Shane\n\nI have this fancy pants map. OK. That will tell us. So let me go ahead. \n\n\n\n3:32 | Myia\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n3:40 | Shane\n\nI thought you guys would have been... Yeah. So you're too far north for the SRECs, for DC SRECs. That doesn't mean that you're not getting SRECs. They're just going to be valued at the Maryland, you know, the Maryland value. OK. \n\n\n\n4:02 | Myia\n\nAnd what address do you have? \n\n\n\n4:05 | Shane\n\nthis. 91 59 Brookville. \n\n\n\n4:07 | Myia\n\nYes. OK. \n\n\n\n4:10 | Shane\n\nYeah. All right. So I like to just kind of run through a few of these early questions. It helps us sort of understand, you know, throughout the process what we're dealing with and those sorts of things. So, you know, it sounds like, you know, one of the main metrics that you're after is cost savings. Are there any other, you know, reasons that you look at going solar, you know, right now? \n\n\n\n4:38 | Myia\n\nI believe cost savings is the big one. Just with that monthly cost savings and just seeing if we would be able to get any return back from savings to kind of add because we are a non profit. So it would be nice if we can just add funds to that bowl of funds that we do have for our team. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Shane\n\nGot it. And who ultimately makes the decisions based around something like this? \n\n\n\n5:05 | Myia\n\nIt would probably be our CEO. So we would have this discussion. I would, you know, bring her information and based off of what she's read and we can have a discussion based off of, you know, what you're saying, other people are saying. And from there, she would kind of, you know, make a decision depending on the price costing, you know, whatever we can gather from this meeting today and then kind of see if we need to have another one if necessary to get, you know, any questions, you know, cleared up. \n\n\n\n5:34 | Shane\n\nOkay, and so you kind of helped me with, you know, the next steps in that. As far as the decision making process, will she meet with any board members? You know, how does it sort of fall into players that just come onto her desk and she's sort of the... \n\n\n\n5:51 | Myia\n\nI definitely think it's a still wider conversation, but I think that that's the initiation of that conversation. And from there, I can't really say who else will be a part of that conversation, but I just know that, you know, I would bring information to Amy and, you know, I will present that to her and we will just see where we can kind of go from there. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Shane\n\nGot it. And Pepco Bills, it's not feeling good to you guys. You'd like to reduce that any way you can, right? Yes. All right. Okay. I think I have pretty much what I need there. So we have the roof age. We understand that. Let me get back and find you. \n\n\n\n6:47 | Shane\n\nso basically, yeah, I mean, at the beginning of this or at the end of this, I should say, you know, we want to have the idea that yes, this makes sense to move forward and have that conversation, with the CEO. You know, I personally am, a business consultant, you know, developer. So I'm looking at the different ways, that Lumina can help you out. The beauty of sort of what we do as what we would consider an EPC, you were, you know, going to engineer, procure, construct, this system is, we have the multiple different ways to go about that. So no matter whether you wanted to take a loan, whether you wanted to pay cash, whether you wanted to do like a power purchase agreement, we'll get into those things in a moment. We, have the ability to do all of those things. You know, whereas most are sort of aligned with one of them, and want to lead, you know, the direction that they want. the beauty with us is that we really want to educate you on all things solar, you know, give you sort of the opportunities and make the suggestions as we see fit as to what we think would be the best for you, but ultimately the decisions in your hands and we can sort of handle any avenue that you want to, to take. And, you know, we've been doing this, you know, for a very long time. Actually, I think right around the corner from you guys, Sandy Springs Meeting House, we just did solar there, which was a very small project, but we've done targets, Coca Cola, you know, our portfolio is very robust in, you know, size and scale. But we're local. We like to do jobs for local folks and, you know, nonprofits are, you know, a big, piece, of where we feel we can make, a huge impact given what you guys do and what solar can do for your business. So, as far as, your bill, I will need to get a copy of that from you. That's going to sort of allow me to see and understand how much electricity you're using. I can calculate out what you're currently paying, per kilowatt hour, and then be able to also, you know, convert that into what sort of savings, you know, would look like. Are you familiar with sort of the forms or ways that you can go about, investing in solar, you know, No, I'm not. So let's go real high level. There's basically three big buckets. The one is cash. It's really easy. You know, most people are going to understand that. It's, you know, you pay us a sum of money, we install the solar on the system, and then we would show you, through the different, you know, federal incentives, local incentives, Maryland incentives, and then, as you alluded to earlier, SRECs and, you know, electricity savings, how long it would take you to recoup that investment and what, you know, overall, you know, income you can create really in, you know, the savings that you would no longer have to pay for electricity once that's, you know, been, you know, beyond the break even point. The second would be a loan. Basically, all the things that I just said to you except you would take out a loan to do that. For a period of time, you know, the shorter period you may be spending more than you would for, you know, your electricity or you can go with a longer loan that may, you know, actually lower the expense on a monthly basis, you know, loan payment compared to, you know, what you would pay for your Pepco bill and, you know, save that way. So very similar, you know, And then the last and sometimes most appealing for a lot of nonprofits would be a PPA or a power purchase agreement. Most people sort of catch what we're saying if I just say a lease. But basically, the way that this would work is through no cash of your own, this system would be installed on your building. What you basically do is agree to buy that power that's created by the solar system at a locked in cost for 20 years. Okay, so let's say your bill, you're currently paying 17 cents per kilowatt hour. That's the form of electricity coming in. That's how they calculate what you're going to pay in total. And maybe I could get a 13 cent per kilowatt hour rate, right? So you would say four cents. Okay. Doesn't sound huge, but when you, we look at that bill and let's say you're using 150,000 kilowatt hours, that could be saving you thousands of. \n\n\n\n11:44 | Myia\n\nand in, right? \n\n\n\n11:46 | Shane\n\nAnd through no money coming out of your pocket. Now you wouldn't see most of the incentives that would come because somebody else is going to own that system. They're going to say, okay, I'll pay for it to go there. I'll get the incentives. I'll get the kilowatt hour rate, right? The solar production, they'll pay me, but obviously they're saving. Everybody wins, right? They pay us to install that system. Does that make sense to you? Yes, it does. Again, I initially would lean towards that given that most nonprofits are a bit cash strapped. Correct me if I'm wrong there, but a lot of times, this is a business that you're doing for the community and not necessarily to print money. That could be the case. That's one that I would very strongly look at. So just to give you an idea here. \n\n\n\n12:46 | Myia\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n12:48 | Shane\n\nshare my screen. \n\n\n\n12:51 | Myia\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n12:54 | Shane\n\nThis is your building down here, would you say? Yes. Okay. So this is actually what your building will look like with solar panels. So we can actually create a three D model. Okay. If there were any trees or anything of concern, we could map those out and really understand, but you can even see up on the roof any HVAC units. I've mapped those out. You know, we can do when it comes necessary, do a site walk to make sure we're seeing everything. But currently, we could get a pretty solid system up there that could actually offset up to 200,000 kilowatt hours. \n\n\n\n13:33 | Myia\n\nbut that's, \n\n\n\n13:36 | Shane\n\nsort of, you know, up in the air once we see the bill, then we can fit that. So my ask would be to you to go ahead and get that for us. \n\n\n\n13:51 | Myia\n\nAnd. \n\n\n\n13:51 | Shane\n\nthen we can, sort of, move forward with a follow up meeting once I can dissect that. Would you agree that the Power Purchase Agreement is probably a strong front runner as far as, like, the way that you would want to potentially proceed forward? \n\n\n\n14:08 | Myia\n\nI do agree with that. I did have some questions because you did mention that we're on the DC grid but we're too far up north. \n\n\n\n14:17 | Shane\n\nYou're not on the DC grid at all. \n\n\n\n14:19 | Myia\n\nWe're not? Okay. No. Do you mind sharing that map for reference? Yeah. Just so we can see this ourselves. \n\n\n\n14:29 | Shane\n\nYeah. So you do have, I'm almost certain this has public access. I could even share the link. But this is so you see this blue lines here, right? Those are basically the feeder lines around DC and anything that goes over that line into the Maryland side that are fed. Okay. That's who gets it. So all I do is come over here. Brookville. \n\n\n\n15:12 | Myia\n\nOh yeah, we're in Silver Spring. \n\n\n\n15:17 | Shane\n\nTa da! \n\n\n\n15:19 | Myia\n\nI can send that on. Let me see. Hold on, hold on. I can send the address over to you. \n\n\n\n15:31 | Myia\n\nI don't know why it's popping up like that. It should be, the zip code should be two zero 910. Silver Spring, Maryland. \n\n\n\n15:45 | Myia\n\ni can't really we can kind of see how the book feel this but let me make sure on my end too. \n\n\n\n15:52 | Shane\n\nI mean because I have it. \n\n\n\n16:21 | Myia\n\nOkay. Alright, let me try to put that in. \n\n\n\n16:22 | Shane\n\nagain because I see now like the address that I have in the maps is. \n\n\n\n16:25 | Myia\n\nBecause I believe I was looking at this too. I was able to put in the address though. \n\n\n\n16:36 | Myia\n\nI usually say... \n\n\n\n16:51 | Myia\n\nAm I spelling that? Brookville, BROOKVILLE. Yeah. \n\n\n\n17:03 | Shane\n\nLet's try that. \n\n\n\n17:06 | Myia\n\nAll right. \n\n\n\n17:08 | Shane\n\nOh, wait. Okay. I think I have it here. There we go. So actually, yes. It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n\nIt's pretty wild. Have you had experience with other commercial buildings being on the DC? Absolutely. In Maryland, how does that work out for you? Like, when you go to fill out that application form for whatever electricity service they're using, like how does it, is it good? Because I've been reading things and I know it's a little tricky once you kind of are in Maryland, but still on that line with solar panels. So how is that experience for your team? \n\n\n\n19:35 | Shane\n\nYeah, so it's actually fairly simple, you know, because we supply the interconnection documents to whichever PEPCO that you're attached to. So, you know, PEPCO, we submit to them. But when we apply for the SREC and set that up is where we're able to prove and use, you know, if you are indeed on the feeder line from D C.,. They then determine that your SRECs are to be sold via the DC market. Yeah, so that's sort of where it comes into play. Yeah, so it's less about the interconnection, more about you know, signing you up correctly on the SREC website. So yeah, we can verify, we can get that information, you know, it may require a little bit of legwork from you depending, you know, sometimes it's a little more straightforward and easy to see, but we would need to determine that. So yeah, but that's, it's great news. I mean, again, it's a great opportunity regardless, but again, there's no denying if indeed you're via the DC grid, it's a heck of a lot better. So, okay. All right. So what do you think the turnaround time would be for you to get me the PEPCO bill? \n\n\n\n21:05 | Myia\n\nI am working on it. So once they send it over, hopefully, I'm hoping by the end of this week, the week I can send you over the most latest copy of the PEPCO bill. Just so we can see the rates and see what numbers we can get based off of that or savings and everything like that. \n\n\n\n21:22 | Shane\n\nYep. And if you could just make sure, like, the bill itself, I think it's the second or third page provides a, 24 month usage map graph. Okay. That's very important because obviously your usage likely, you know, varies, You know, month to month dependent upon winter, you know, summer and what's actually running. So I can actually calculate and use, you know, your actuals over the last 12 months and add that up. So I know how much you're using in total, you know, that way. \n\n\n\n22:00 | Myia\n\nOkay, that's perfect. That's perfect. So I'll definitely work on getting that sent to you so we can see those types of numbers and see what we're working on. \n\n\n\n22:08 | Shane\n\nAnd then, you know, setting up the next one, I don't know the level of, you know, busyness of the CEO. It is sometimes extremely helpful if I'm able to simply sit down with you and that person, Amy, I think you said, you know, I'm happy to sit down with just you to give you the information. But most people end up with questions and questions that you won't quite be able to answer. You know, or remember, if you're anything like me, so having the ability to have them in the room and I'd be happy to drive down, you know, meet on site and have that, you know, roughly hour meeting, you know, with you guys to make sure I answer any questions you have. Oh, whatever works best, you know, we'll work with you guys. It's just been in our experience to sort of the faster that we can handle the questions from, you know, sort of the top down. Okay. It works for everybody. \n\n\n\n23:12 | Myia\n\nCan I ask just a couple of questions, just kind of like this type of questions regarding the solar panels? Can you go back to the, to the out the three D that you have of our own warehouse right quick. Yep. Okay. So we, for parking, we have the lot to the left side, like just down that left side, right there. We have the front right in front of our building. And then we have what's on the right side, which there's more parking where the map is cut off right there. Yeah. But it's just going to be all the way down the right side. So the back area that you're seeing is usually the parking for our neighboring company, which is Auto Shop. How much space would you need and how much time would it take to have this project completed? \n\n\n\n24:06 | Shane\n\nYeah, great question. So a project like this, I would say we would be physically on the site installing for maybe two to three weeks, but we would mobilize in a day. And by mobilize, basically that's where we would bring a crane, a lift, whatever we need to get all of our material onto the site and onto the roof Lay that out, you know, and sort of set that as we need it. \n\n\n\n24:41 | Myia\n\nOkay, so that's just one day just to put that on top of it. \n\n\n\n24:45 | Shane\n\nYeah, and then from there, you know, we'll be predominantly on the roof. There's in the electrical room, we'll have work that we need to do there. But my guess is you guys typically aren't working in your electrical room or on your roof. So, you know, from the perspective of us doing that, we'll be able to sort of You know coexist and you'll be able to operate and, you know, it'd be a few company trucks that would need space to park out there. \n\n\n\n25:16 | Myia\n\nOkay. How many parking spaces do you think that you might need? \n\n\n\n25:21 | Shane\n\nI mean, maybe three, but also, if necessary, we could probably cone off, you know, around a certain area. You know, and not take up if parking is a commodity there. You know, maybe we could, you know, find a place where we could cone off or something like that. \n\n\n\n25:45 | Myia\n\nOkay, we definitely can do that. Like on a site visit, just take a walk around and see what spot is more feasible. And if a conversation needs to be had with like our neighboring company, then we'll see if we can work out something if need be. But yeah, we can take a look at that, I guess when we're like walking and just get a you can get a physical perception of like the outside space that you guys would be having and stuff like that. \n\n\n\n26:08 | Shane\n\nYeah, yeah, again, it's a fairly light footprint that, you know, you would have as far as taking up space. And again, we're in areas that most of the times, you're not using so so be sort of out of sight out of mind. \n\n\n\n26:22 | Myia\n\nPerfect. And then another question I had is, I know the roof is fairly new, but in the event that we might need to remove solar panels to maybe do like a roof repair or like just remove them temporarily, like, is there a fee associated with that? Like, how would that work? \n\n\n\n26:41 | Shane\n\nYeah, so there would be, you know, a fee or a cost associated if we had to do that. You know, the beauty of what we do is we're not actually attaching directly into the roof. In this case, we would do what's considered a ballast. So, basically, it's going to be concrete block holding down the trays and then the panels, you know, are kind of, you know, laid on one of the racking of that. You know, as far as There being, like, obviously we can't say there's not going to be any roofing issues, but believe it or not, having the panels up there will help protect the roof and help, you know, remove chances of something happening to it. They're basically a barrier between the sun and any debris. So yeah, and a lot of times, even if there is an issue, you can work around the panel, like you can see underneath of them, you can get underneath of them. So There's a lot of ways around that before you would have to start considering, you know, removing those panels and doing that, you know, but. \n\n\n\n27:50 | Myia\n\nbe in place for if ownership, whether we own it or whether another company owns it, or is it just specifically to like, if we were to own it. \n\n\n\n28:00 | Shane\n\nSo if there's, it's sort of a nuanced question, right? So if there was an issue to your roof specifically, and, you know, the panels needed to be, you know, removed to gain access there, that would be something that would be, you know, cost on you. Now, if there was a situation where the panels had an issue, right, or let's say panels caused an issue, I don't expect that, but, you know, Those types of issues would fall on the owner of the system, right? So in the case that it was, you know, third party owned, then they would be in charge to take care of that and get things, you know, right. If you were the owner of the system, then you would be, you know, in charge of sort of the maintenance of that system, if you will. You know, and just to kind of follow on that with the third party, some people are like, oh, well, they'll just get to it when they can get to it. Remember that system working appropriately produces what they need to get those incentives, right, to produce, to have the bill paid to them that, you know, they expected that to be. So they'll be very adamant in getting that fixed just as you would be. again, it's all, everybody's incentivized to make sure that happens. And then we would have the O &M contract. We do have our own energy services department in house. So we would be the ones handling that maintenance, which is another great sort of add on to our company. \n\n\n\n29:39 | Myia\n\nAnd for, so do you guys have a tax credit that could be offered? Like do you guys tax credit, incentives, savings, everything like that? So any. \n\n\n\n29:49 | Shane\n\nthing that is applicable to solar, you know, we can help guide you along in getting that. You know, there is, if you own the system, there's a 30 percent federal tax credit. Okay. That would be on you to get. Now, in your case, because you're a non profit, you don't pay taxes, there is the direct pay incentive, which is a bit more detailed in order to get, let's say, but it is available, you know, and we can sort of help guide you, provide you the information for that, but ultimately that is sort of on you. Now, there's a Maryland grant, solar grant, that we would be able to definitely help you apply and get, obviously helping set you up with a SREC broker that would handle all of that, and I think really that's it in your area. So again, we would help you and guide you throughout any incentive process, but you know, ultimately that does fall on, you know, you as the owner, if you own the system. Okay. But we definitely want to make sure that you're getting that and help you in any way that we can. \n\n\n\n31:09 | Myia\n\nOkay. And in the event that, let's say we do the PPA and somebody else, you know, purchases the system, would we be able to buy it, buy them out? And if so, what is the minimum amount of years that company would have to own before we can buy that solar panel? \n\n\n\n31:31 | Shane\n\nfive or seven years. Okay. Dependent, I'm pretty certain I know who we would go through this. But yeah, so basically, it's just a sort of a breakout of time where they can ensure that they recoup their investment before you could purchase the system outright. That would be made available in the contract, you would be aware of what that looks like, you know, before you signed on the dotted line. So yeah, that will be laid out for you. \n\n\n\n32:01 | Myia\n\nOkay, that's great. That's great. And I think, I mean, I think that pretty much answers it. You said like the next step would basically be just, you know, giving you the billings and stuff and just seeing what, how much and how much we would, you know, numbers and stuff once we get that information. And then I know like, you guys would have to submit the application through PEPCO to kind of get them to, you know, figure out whether, we approve or deny for the application. \n\n\n\n32:34 | Shane\n\nYeah, so, so we handle again, our work as an EPC, is turnkey, you know, so this would be considered a turnkey development where everything from permitting, you know, submitting for interconnection with PEPCO, All of those things we would handle, we have teams that handle, you know, so that when this is ultimately finished, you know, everything's been approved, everything's been inspected, you know, and PEPCO's done what they need to do in order to accurately monitor and maintain the system and the solar production. Yep, so, so yeah, I mean, barring, you know, us getting there and, you know, your electrical room being in total disarray and needing, you know, significant upgrades or something like, that we would have to bring forth to, you know, the system is, you know, when we get to the pricing perspective of, it is sort of a, you know, an all in pricing, barring, again, any unforeseen, you know, issues with, you know, where we might need upgrades. \n\n\n\n33:43 | Myia\n\nOkay, so just like, especially because you said the electrical one, like, depending on the condition of, that could play a factor. \n\n\n\n33:50 | Shane\n\nIt could, and that's, again, that's something that we would catch fairly early on, if not, you know, prior to, you know, I typically like to do a site walk, you know, see everything, get some pictures if I have some concerns, you know, I would guess that this building is fairly up to date, that I wouldn't expect any issues, but it's not, it's just something that's not out of the, you know, the possibility. Right. But, you know, it's a, it's not, a very tall building, you know, with a new roof, there's a lot of things going that I don't foresee any major, anything to kind of jump out of this after the fact. \n\n\n\n34:34 | Myia\n\nOkay, and then for the application process with PEPCO, like how long, do you have like an average on usually how long that usually takes when you do submit those applications for things like this? \n\n\n\n34:48 | Shane\n\nI wish I could give you a really good answer for that one. But unfortunately, PEPCO is not always the most accurate. It typically takes a few months. You know, permitting with Montgomery County is actually quite efficient. They're pretty good. They're pretty responsive. Interconnection with PEPCO. Yeah, again, they have initial reviews. It shouldn't take more than, that time. But again, it is, it's sort of difficult. It's why when I talk to, you know, customers like yourselves, it's like sort of the total timeline, it could be six months to a year, right before you would have a fully operational system from the point of signing the contract. \n\n\n\n35:41 | Shane\n\nOh, wow. Okay. And I mean, that's just sort of, again, the process with which, you know, we work under and as I said, you know, we know it's going to be two to three weeks on the roof, like the actual installation timeline, but it's all of the permitting, right, the interconnection, the inspections, you know, the different processes that we have to go through. And the unknowns of how long certain You know, people will take to operate. You know, we have a very good idea of not very good idea. We effectively know exactly how many days each step of the process will take us specifically. But once it's into somebody else's hands or waiting on somebody else or need their guidance, that's when it just kind of gets, you know, a little cloudy. Yeah. But, but yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be, yeah, it shouldn't be astronomical. Again, this is a straightforward type of build. \n\n\n\n36:48 | Myia\n\nWell, I appreciate like everything that you've shared with me and I appreciate all the answers that you were able to provide for me. I'm actually great to see that we could have a chance at receiving some, you know, Maryland, but DC SRX and all that. Like you said, that feels like a big difference. \n\n\n\n37:04 | Shane\n\nYeah, I'm glad. In my brain, as soon as I saw that Olney and Brookville, I was just like, they're up there. And that's where you were. But this, yeah, I mean, we'll have to figure that out and define that and make sure, you know, we're correct in it. But yeah, it could be. And again, regardless, this is a great opportunity. I work a ton with nonprofits, you know, and really like to see the fruits of the labor, you know, come through with, you know, what you guys are doing and be able to mitigate some of these expenses that Ultimately, falls to typically the people that you're serving, right? It gives you a greater ability to invest and serve in your community. So we enjoy these types of projects, you know, especially as a local company, you know, we're based out of South Baltimore, but we do quite a bit of work and I lived in that area for quite a bit of time. So yeah, so we'll enjoy it. So yeah, give me the bill and that allows me to really do the design talk and create the picture of the financial outlook for you guys. \n\n\n\n38:23 | Myia\n\nOkay, no problem. Can you send me a screenshot of this map, like you said, the solar panel mapping? And then I also just have one more question. How much space is between each solar panel? \n\n\n\n38:35 | Shane\n\nSo in this case, we're using a five degree tilt. So there would be eight inches in between. As you'll see here again, if like if I zoom in to all of like HVAC and stuff, that is actually roughly a three foot setback that's going to go around all of those areas to make sure that you have ample space for any work that would need to be done to those. \n\n\n\n38:58 | Myia\n\nPerfect. \n\n\n\n38:59 | Shane\n\nYeah, so, and then we have, we ensure that there's going to be walkways, right, to any of that equipment. Okay. So, so as far as, yeah, being able to get up there and do what you guys need to do, you know, definitely. \n\n\n\n39:15 | Myia\n\nshould be pretty accessible. be accessible, yes, yes. \n\n\n\n39:19 | Shane\n\nCertain requirements around certain pieces of equipment that we abide by, and then, yeah, you know, the only thing I'll typically get tight on is maybe like a drain or something like that, where, you know, as long as it's not impeded, it's fine. \n\n\n\n39:37 | Myia\n\nAll right, well, that's perfect. I mean, I have all the information I need. I'm definitely going to try to work on getting you this bill sent. Yep. By the end of this week, hopefully we can get a send to you and then we can just go from there. Yep. And see where this can take us. I'm really hoping that it can work out. Yeah. \n\n\n\n39:53 | Shane\n\nI think there is a great opportunity for that to happen. You know, most importantly, once I have that, you know, we have the follow up call and I can more thoroughly educate you guys on how this works, what options, you know, and what they look like. You know, so that ultimately at the end of the day, I want you to say a very confident yes or a very confident no, you know, and at the end of the day, the faster I can do that and the faster you can make that decision, you know, the faster I'm either working for you or, you know, continuing my job to go and find other folks that want to say yes, it's perfectly fine, you know, and the faster that you're back, you know, doing what, you know, your main detail of your job, you know, entails. So, yeah. but I want to just make sure that you guys are, you know, fully educated and on board whatever you decide to do. That's the goal. \n\n\n\n40:49 | Myia\n\nWell, I appreciate that 100 percent. \n\n\n\n40:53 | Shane\n\nAll right, Myia. Well, look, again, I appreciate it. I'll keep my eyes peeled for that. And once we have it, we can schedule the next step. \n\n\n\n40:59 | Myia\n\nAll right. Looking forward to it. You have a nice one. \n\n\n\n41:03 | Shane\n\nYou too. Take care. Bye bye.",

            "Here\u2019s a detailed comparison of Shane\u2019s call against the Discovery Call Template (MEDPICC framework), focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and overall adherence.\n\n### 1. **Introduction**\n   - **Greeting and Rapport**: Shane started with a friendly greeting and immediately engaged in understanding the client\u2019s mission, showing interest in the organization\u2019s values. This was a good way to build rapport.\n   - **Introduction to Lumina Solar**: He provided a brief overview of Lumina Solar\u2019s offerings (EPC model and flexibility in financing options), but the introduction was informal and missed a clear, structured agenda.\n   - **Purpose and Agenda**: Shane didn\u2019t explicitly set an agenda or purpose for the call but did address key areas informally, which may have limited the call\u2019s direction.\n\n### 2. **Rapport Building**\n   - **Personal Connection**: Shane successfully built rapport by discussing Myia\u2019s role and expressing an understanding of nonprofit challenges. This aligned well with the template\u2019s suggestion to establish a connection.\n   - **Business-Specific Questions**: Although he inquired about the nonprofit\u2019s mission, he could have added questions about specific energy-related challenges, which would have deepened his understanding of their needs.\n\n### 3. **Exploration and Discovery (MEDPICC Framework)**\n   - **Metrics (M)**: Shane identified cost savings as a key driver and explained how solar could offset electricity costs, aligning well with the metrics goal. However, he didn\u2019t ask in-depth questions about other financial targets or specific cost-saving goals, which could help refine his pitch.\n   - **Economic Buyer (E)**: He clarified that the CEO would be the ultimate decision-maker, and he briefly probed into their decision-making dynamics. However, Shane could have asked more about the CEO\u2019s priorities and expectations to better align his solution with the decision-maker\u2019s vision.\n   - **Decision Criteria (D)**: Shane touched on cost savings and potential solar incentives. However, he missed asking for specific criteria or benchmarks the organization would use to evaluate providers, limiting his understanding of the client\u2019s priorities.\n   - **Decision Process (D)**: Shane asked about the decision-making process but didn\u2019t deeply explore any board member involvement or milestones, which would have provided better insights into the approval timeline and who might influence the decision.\n   - **Paper Process (P)**: Shane discussed Lumina\u2019s turnkey services, including handling permits, which aligns with understanding the client\u2019s legal needs. However, he didn\u2019t inquire about specific contracting concerns or terms they might require.\n   - **Identify Pain (I)**: He identified that high electricity bills were a concern and recognized the financial constraints common in nonprofits, but he didn\u2019t explore deeper implications if these cost issues remain unaddressed.\n   - **Champion (C)**: Shane didn\u2019t specifically identify a champion. He could have asked if there were others in the organization advocating for solar, which might help him understand internal support.\n   - **Competition (C)**: Shane didn\u2019t ask if the organization was considering other solar providers, missing an opportunity to understand how Lumina compares and tailor his approach.\n\n### 4. **Suitability and Financial Considerations**\n   - **Site Suitability**: Shane asked relevant questions about the site, such as roof condition, HVAC systems, and parking needs. He demonstrated the system\u2019s placement with a 3D model, showing a strong alignment with the template\u2019s site suitability focus.\n   - **Investment Model**: He explained different financing options, including a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which was especially relevant for a cash-constrained nonprofit. This was well-aligned with the template, although he could have inquired more about preferences between financing types.\n\n### 5. **Next Steps and Confirmation**\n   - **Recap Key Insights**: Shane did not provide a clear summary at the end. A recap of the main points could have helped reinforce mutual understanding.\n   - **Propose Next Steps**: Shane set up next steps by requesting the electric bill, although it could have been more structured, suggesting a follow-up meeting specifically to review the proposal.\n   - **Confirm Timeline**: While he didn\u2019t lock in a specific date for the follow-up, he suggested scheduling it after reviewing the bill, keeping the client informed about the process.\n\n### 6. **Closing**\n   - **Thank You and Enthusiasm**: Shane expressed appreciation and enthusiasm, reinforcing a positive end to the call. He showed understanding of the nonprofit\u2019s goals, emphasizing his intent to support their mission.\n   - **Reiterate Commitment**: Although he didn\u2019t explicitly reiterate Lumina\u2019s commitment to meeting their needs, Shane emphasized his willingness to support the nonprofit, suggesting dedication to providing value.\n\n### **Summary**\n- **What Shane Did Well**: He built strong rapport, provided a thorough overview of solar financing options, and demonstrated a site-specific model that helped address potential questions about system placement.\n- **Areas for Improvement**: Shane could improve by setting a clear agenda, summarizing key insights, and exploring deeper discovery questions around metrics, decision criteria, and competition. Following the MEDPICC structure more closely would likely enhance the clarity and effectiveness of his discovery process, uncovering further insights and building a stronger foundation for moving forward."

So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n\nWe have, we have one, two partners that, we have to like, we have to all agree on this decisions, but, they are all aware of this solar installation solutions. So, we just need to go back to them with the numbers and well, figure it out pretty quick. \n\n\n\n13:09 | Mark\n\nThat, that makes my life easy. And then it goes through there, Its contracting. Now, have you done solar on any other property or is this your first time? \n\n\n\n13:23 | Robin\n\nThis is our first time, actually. So thats why. \n\n\n\n13:26 | Mark\n\nOh, excellent. Where do you own properties? Because I can tell you if you own them in certain markets, theyre more lucrative than in other markets. So, for example, if you own properties in Washington, DC, your return is going to be double if not triple a system in Maryland. \n\n\n\n13:44 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think our partner has probably, probably on DC, but, like we are not always a partner on every product. Yeah. So, our investment, prior to this product, the property, it was, basically in Texas or North Carolina, someplace like that. Yeah. And Maryland, this is our first time doing investment there, So. \n\n\n\n14:10 | Mark\n\nGreat. Well, welcome to Maryland. Were very nice here and, were going to take care of you. Great. All right. So, heres what I would propose, You need to see some numbers. I need to get some information from you. Yes. Obviously, I need to get some electric bills, Right? If you could send those to me, 12 months is always good. Mm, hmm. And then I can put those into my models and look at what youre, paying, Look at what youre using. And then basically, from that information, I can tell you what well be able to, what solar will be able to do for you. Got it. I will design the buildings that if we did the project tomorrow, the site would be viable. And Im, looking at the site and it looks like we are, it looks like about half of them are good. I see some, like I said, the roofs are beautiful, brand new, And I see some that, you know, they probably look like they have about, You know, 10 ish years left on the warranty. And so thats really going to be your decision. Ill, show you what it looks like. But ultimately, youre, going to need to make that call. Okay. Yeah. So, and then really, I need to know where the meters are, because, for example, you know, Im, looking all the way back on this cul, de sac, This is going to be prime territory here. Im, going to use every single one of these buildings. And if the meter is at, for example, the front of the complex, its going to cost a good amount of money to get the power from the front or from the back, all the way to the front.

Is it Shane? Yes. Nice to meet you. \n\n\n\n0:09 | Shane\n\nAll right. Nice to meet you. Glad you could take a little time. So in general, just to get started, you know, what do you do with the wider circle and what sort of, you know, the mission? I think I have an idea, you know, having researched the company and everything, but. \n\n\n\n0:29 | Myia\n\nYeah, so we just help those in need. We have a couple different programs. We have a furniture assistant program that also includes special appointments for babies. We have a PDC, which is professional clothing. We provide clothing to those that might need it. We also have a career development program that's really good at just providing like job fairs and just helping and coaching those who might be looking for work. And we also have a volunteer team, which is really great. We have volunteers almost here every day, just, you know, helping us with our daily operations. So it's just really nice to just have that support team give back in multiple different ways than one, you know, and it's really all it's about. We've been at this location ever since 2000, I believe we've been at this location ever since 2008, but we've been running for ever since 2001. We took ownership of this building in 2016 And then we installed the new roof in 20 21. \n\n\n\n1:36 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. Look at you just knocking out questions as you know I was going to ask anyway. Well that's good. I mean it's you know it's really important and as you were to potentially look at any sort of investment you know the roof span the lifespan is it's usually important and having only been a few years old you know the life expectancy of the roof and solar you know co align here very well so that's very good to know. So good and And sort of what is your role? \n\n\n\n2:10 | Myia\n\nMy role, I'm the operations manager. Okay. This is my new role so usually I just go around and I make sure you know the operations is up and running everything's going good at the facility and just also looking for any improvements you know that can be also add on to a wider circle. Okay, good. \n\n\n\n2:27 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. And then, you know, sort of before we get started into the questions that I'll have but. \n\n\n\n2:35 | Myia\n\nJust obviously, \n\n\n\n2:35 | Shane\n\nwe reached out to you, but typically, people respond having some background of solar or is this something that you guys have looked at previously? You know, what sort of things led, you know, to sit down with me today? \n\n\n\n2:50 | Myia\n\nWe're just something that we're considering. We know that it could probably help out with the PEPCO bill depending on how much of the savings analysis and I do know that there's just the savings incentives. We also believe, it's a possibility that we might be on a DC grid as well. So that's also that. So I don't know if the SRECs would come into play with that or it's, yeah, so... \n\n\n\n3:20 | Shane\n# \u30104\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n38:23 | Myia\n\nOkay, no problem. Can you send me a screenshot of this map, like you said, the solar panel mapping? And then I also just have one more question. How much space is between each solar panel? \n\n\n\n38:35 | Shane\n\nSo in this case, we're using a five degree tilt. So there would be eight inches in between. As you'll see here again, if like if I zoom in to all of like HVAC and stuff, that is actually roughly a three foot setback that's going to go around all of those areas to make sure that you have ample space for any work that would need to be done to those. \n\n\n\n38:58 | Myia\n\nPerfect. \n\n\n\n38:59 | Shane\n\nYeah, so, and then we have, we ensure that there's going to be walkways, right, to any of that equipment. Okay. So, so as far as, yeah, being able to get up there and do what you guys need to do, you know, definitely. \n\n\n\n39:15 | Myia\n\nshould be pretty accessible. be accessible, yes, yes. \n\n\n\n39:19 | Shane\n\nCertain requirements around certain pieces of equipment that we abide by, and then, yeah, you know, the only thing I'll typically get tight on is maybe like a drain or something like that, where, you know, as long as it's not impeded, it's fine. \n\n\n\n39:37 | Myia\n\nAll right, well, that's perfect. I mean, I have all the information I need. I'm definitely going to try to work on getting you this bill sent. Yep. By the end of this week, hopefully we can get a send to you and then we can just go from there. Yep. And see where this can take us. I'm really hoping that it can work out. Yeah. \n\n\n\n39:53 | Shane\n\nI think there is a great opportunity for that to happen. You know, most importantly, once I have that, you know, we have the follow up call and I can more thoroughly educate you guys on how this works, what options, you know, and what they look like. You know, so that ultimately at the end of the day, I want you to say a very confident yes or a very confident no, you know, and at the end of the day, the faster I can do that and the faster you can make that decision, you know, the faster I'm either working for you or, you know, continuing my job to go and find other folks that want to say yes, it's perfectly fine, you know, and the faster that you're back, you know, doing what, you know, your main detail of your job, you know, entails. So, yeah. but I want to just make sure that you guys are, you know, fully educated and on board whatever you decide to do. That's the goal. \n\n\n\n40:49 | Myia\n\nWell, I appreciate that 100 percent. \n\n\n\n40:53 | Shane\n\nAll right, Myia. Well, look, again, I appreciate it. I'll keep my eyes peeled for that. And once we have it, we can schedule the next step. \n\n\n\n40:59 | Myia\n\nAll right. Looking forward to it. You have a nice one. \n\n\n\n41:03 | Shane\n\nYou too. Take care.

Okay. I think I have it here. There we go. So actually, yes. It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n\nIt's pretty wild. Have you had experience with other commercial buildings being on the DC? Absolutely. In Maryland, how does that work out for you? Like, when you go to fill out that application form for whatever electricity service they're using, like how does it, is it good? Because I've been reading things and I know it's a little tricky once you kind of are in Maryland, but still on that line with solar panels. So how is that experience for your team? \n\n\n\n19:35 | Shane\n\nYeah, so it's actually fairly simple, you know, because we supply the interconnection documents to whichever PEPCO that you're attached to. So, you know, PEPCO, we submit to them. But when we apply for the SREC and set that up is where we're able to prove and use, you know, if you are indeed on the feeder line from D C.,. They then determine that your SRECs are to be sold via the DC market. Yeah, so that's sort of where it comes into play. Yeah, so it's less about the interconnection, more about you know, signing you up correctly on the SREC website. So yeah, we can verify, we can get that information, you know, it may require a little bit of legwork from you depending, you know, sometimes it's a little more straightforward and easy to see, but we would need to determine that. So yeah, but that's, it's great news. I mean, again, it's a great opportunity regardless, but again, there's no denying if indeed you're via the DC grid, it's a heck of a lot better. So, okay. All right. So what do you think the turnaround time would be for you to get me the PEPCO bill? \n\n\n\n21:05 | Myia\n# \u301012\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n2:15 | Mark\n\nNew York, is gonna get, I just remember its always tough, between now and the end of the year. So, anyway, so weve got about a half an hour. Im, really glad, you reached out to us, give you a quick 10 second about who I am, and what we do. Ive, been doing this in Baltimore, D, C, Philadelphia, roughly for About 15 years. I live in Baltimore County, not very close to the proposed property, but I could probably get there in 20 25 minutes as needed. So, thats always a little helpful. We are Lumina, is, were an installer, we also, find, and fund projects with some partners. And so, whatever it is youre, looking to do, we should probably be able to work with you on it. And if not, for some reason, I could probably steer you in the direction of some people that could, so really, today, my thought is just tell me what I can do for you, tell me what youre, looking for, tell me how I can help and well, go through a few questions and that should probably dictate how we take it from here. \n\n\n\n3:37 | Robin\n\nOkay. Yeah, sure. So, do you want me to briefly introduce, what we are looking for? \n\n\n\n3:45 | Mark\n\nYep. Thats a great way to start? \n\n\n\n3:47 | Robin\n\nYeah. So, we recently got this, multi family apartment community, and theres, there are about, 20 20 buildings, in total and, the reason we are looking for at grid type solar panels on the roof is because like, we are trying to see if its, doable and, efficient to, covered the electricity bills by adding the solar panels on the roof. \n\n\n\n4:21 | Mark\n\nCan you give me the address again? I know I have it somewhere so I can look at it on Google Maps and take a look at what the roofs look like. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Robin\n\nLet me address and copy. \n\n\n\n4:44 | Robin\n\nI will just copy the address in the chat box. Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, Our property manager is Donaldsons. \n\n\n\n6:41 | Mark\n# \u301013\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n5:34 | Shane\n\nOkay, and so you kind of helped me with, you know, the next steps in that. As far as the decision making process, will she meet with any board members? You know, how does it sort of fall into players that just come onto her desk and she's sort of the... \n\n\n\n5:51 | Myia\n\nI definitely think it's a still wider conversation, but I think that that's the initiation of that conversation. And from there, I can't really say who else will be a part of that conversation, but I just know that, you know, I would bring information to Amy and, you know, I will present that to her and we will just see where we can kind of go from there. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Shane\n\nGot it. And Pepco Bills, it's not feeling good to you guys. You'd like to reduce that any way you can, right? Yes. All right. Okay. I think I have pretty much what I need there. So we have the roof age. We understand that. Let me get back and find you. \n\n\n\n6:47 | Shane\n\nso basically, yeah, I mean, at the beginning of this or at the end of this, I should say, you know, we want to have the idea that yes, this makes sense to move forward and have that conversation, with the CEO. You know, I personally am, a business consultant, you know, developer. So I'm looking at the different ways, that Lumina can help you out. The beauty of sort of what we do as what we would consider an EPC, you were, you know, going to engineer, procure, construct, this system is, we have the multiple different ways to go about that. So no matter whether you wanted to take a loan, whether you wanted to pay cash, whether you wanted to do like a power purchase agreement, we'll get into those things in a moment. We, have the ability to do all of those things. You know, whereas most are sort of aligned with one of them, and want to lead, you know, the direction that they want. the beauty with us is that we really want to educate you on all things solar, you know, give you sort of the opportunities and make the suggestions as we see fit as to what we think would be the best for you, but ultimately the decisions in your hands and we can sort of handle any avenue that you want to, to take. And, you know, we've been doing this, you know, for a very long time. Actually, I think right around the corner from you guys, Sandy Springs Meeting House, we just did solar there, which was a very small project, but we've done targets, Coca Cola, you know, our portfolio is very robust in, you know, size and scale. But we're local. We like to do jobs for local folks and, you know, nonprofits are, you know, a big, piece, of where we feel we can make, a huge impact given what you guys do and what solar can do for your business. So, as far as, your bill, I will need to get a copy of that from you. That's going to sort of allow me to see and understand how much electricity you're using. I can calculate out what you're currently paying, per kilowatt hour, and then be able to also, you know, convert that into what sort of savings, you know, would look like. Are you familiar with sort of the forms or ways that you can go about, investing in solar, you know, No, I'm not. So let's go real high level. There's basically three big buckets.\n# \u301014\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n3:20 | Shane\n\nI have this fancy pants map. OK. That will tell us. So let me go ahead. \n\n\n\n3:32 | Myia\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n3:40 | Shane\n\nI thought you guys would have been... Yeah. So you're too far north for the SRECs, for DC SRECs. That doesn't mean that you're not getting SRECs. They're just going to be valued at the Maryland, you know, the Maryland value. OK. \n\n\n\n4:02 | Myia\n\nAnd what address do you have? \n\n\n\n4:05 | Shane\n\nthis. 91 59 Brookville. \n\n\n\n4:07 | Myia\n\nYes. OK. \n\n\n\n4:10 | Shane\n\nYeah. All right. So I like to just kind of run through a few of these early questions. It helps us sort of understand, you know, throughout the process what we're dealing with and those sorts of things. So, you know, it sounds like, you know, one of the main metrics that you're after is cost savings. Are there any other, you know, reasons that you look at going solar, you know, right now? \n\n\n\n4:38 | Myia\n\nI believe cost savings is the big one. Just with that monthly cost savings and just seeing if we would be able to get any return back from savings to kind of add because we are a non profit. So it would be nice if we can just add funds to that bowl of funds that we do have for our team. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Shane\n\nGot it. And who ultimately makes the decisions based around something like this? \n\n\n\n5:05 | Myia\n\nIt would probably be our CEO. So we would have this discussion. I would, you know, bring her information and based off of what she's read and we can have a discussion based off of, you know, what you're saying, other people are saying. And from there, she would kind of, you know, make a decision depending on the price costing, you know, whatever we can gather from this meeting today and then kind of see if we need to have another one if necessary to get, you know, any questions, you know, cleared up. \n\n\n\n5:34 | Shane\n\nOkay, and so you kind of helped me with, you know, the next steps in that. As far as the decision making process, will she meet with any board members? You know, how does it sort of fall into players that just come onto her desk and she's sort of the... \n\n\n\n5:51 | Myia\n\nI definitely think it's a still wider conversation, but I think that that's the initiation of that conversation. And from there, I can't really say who else will be a part of that conversation, but I just know that, you know, I would bring information to Amy and, you know, I will present that to her and we will just see where we can kind of go from there. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Shane\n\nGot it. And Pepco Bills, it's not feeling good to you guys. You'd like to reduce that any way you can, right? Yes. All right. Okay. I think I have pretty much what I need there. So we have the roof age. We understand that. Let me get back and find you. \n\n\n\n6:47 | Shane\n\nso basically, yeah, I mean, at the beginning of this or at the end of this, I should say, you know, we want to have the idea that yes, this makes sense to move forward and have that conversation, with the CEO. You know, I personally am, a business consultant, you know, developer.\n# \u301015\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n9:05 | Mark\n\nUnderstood. Okay. So in terms of installation, any, just double check any installation that any surface that works is okay to install on, correct. Right? Okay. I guess the next big question is who do you want to own this system? Do you want to buy it? Do you want to lease it? What is your strategy for this? \n\n\n\n9:30 | Robin\n\nWhen you talk about lease, are you talking about financing or just like car lease or something like that? \n\n\n\n9:36 | Mark\n\nOkay. So first option for you is going to be buying it outright, Right? You, you spend the money, the panels go on the roof. These panels are essentially an investment for you, Right? You know, I can run a pro forma, show you what the tax credits are, show you, what the payback period is, what your IRR is going to be. And all of those financial, you guys are, you folks are money people, you know this better than me. So whatever your investment hurdle is, whatever makes sense for you in terms of how you use your capital, I would give you that number, so you could decide if this was an investment worth putting your money into. The question. Is theres a third party that comes in, the third party owns the system. They take advantage of all the incentives. So the incentives that would normally go to you during the process, go to them. The solar on the roof produces electricity. It powers the buildings just like it would if you own it. But the people that own the system, Well, charge you a reduced rate for the electricity. \n\n\n\n10:54 | Robin\n\nGot it. Yeah, I dont think, I think Ill, probably will stick to that. We, as the owner of the equipment. So you want to buy it. Yeah. \n\n\n\n11:03 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thats that is easier. Actually. All right. So basically, Im trying to understand really what youre looking for here is you want to get the electric bill as low as you can, Right? Exactly. I will tell you that, Im guessing the electric bill here is pretty substantial. And as I look at the roof, I, you know, I can tell you right now, youre not going to be able to eliminate all of it, You know, with this project still being viable, if you could eliminate, you know? \n\n\n\n11:41 | Robin\n\nOkay. Got it. \n\n\n\n11:44 | Mark\n\nWell, thats a question. Do you think that it will be worth your time? Or is that not enough to really make you interested? \n\n\n\n11:53 | Robin\n\nI mean, I have to try to balance out the payment for the equipment and how like whats the real saving for us? Because I, we are not expert here you are. So I have to figure out, yeah, I have to look at the numbers and try to see if that makes sense Because its kind of hard for me to decide it right now. \n\n\n\n12:18 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Basically, a lot of times people will expect the solar to just completely eliminate the bill And I asked that question up front to temper expectations. Yeah. \n\n\n\n12:31 | Robin\n\nSo we have the expectation that it might not be able to eliminate all the usage, but thats fine with us Just trying to see if the number makes sense? \n\n\n\n12:41 | Mark\n\nMaking sure, making sure that all makes sense. So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n# \u301016\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n4:21 | Mark\n\nCan you give me the address again? I know I have it somewhere so I can look at it on Google Maps and take a look at what the roofs look like. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Robin\n\nLet me address and copy. \n\n\n\n4:44 | Robin\n\nI will just copy the address in the chat box. Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, Our property manager is Donaldsons. \n\n\n\n6:41 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thank you. Yeah, thats always good for me. Good to know. All right. So then youre looking to save money on the electric bill. So, does that mean that these buildings are metered in such a way that you pay the electric bill for the tenants? \n\n\n\n7:01 | Robin\n\nYeah. The tenants, the rents that pay by tenants are included with utility costs. Yeah, Which means that were paying for all the utility costs. \n\n\n\n7:11 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Understood. All right. So, these 20 buildings here, how are they metered? Right? How does BG, E, how many meters, I suppose is, what Im really looking to ask on these buildings? \n\n\n\n7:30 | Robin\n\nI think we have two meters probably, but I have to get back to you on that one though. Yeah, because Ill have to answer once my partner send it over with the past 12 months, electrical bills? \n\n\n\n7:44 | Mark\n\nYep. Okay. So, all right. So theres two meters and Ill, probably if I can figure out where they are, that will help me a lot because obviously were going to need to get the power from the roof to the meter. And I dont know the property that well. So I cant really give you any insight into that. Okay? So you pay the electric bill, you own the buildings, the tenants have the electric bill included in their rent. These roofs, a lot of them look new. Some of them look like they need some work. And then obviously, we have some trees that are shading some of the properties as well. Do you want me to focus on sort of, you know, like the low hanging fruit, what we can install, you know, tomorrow if we needed to, or are you going to explore fixing or replacing some of these roofs? \n\n\n\n8:44 | Robin\n# \u301017\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n14:29 | Shane\n\nYeah. So you do have, I'm almost certain this has public access. I could even share the link. But this is so you see this blue lines here, right? Those are basically the feeder lines around DC and anything that goes over that line into the Maryland side that are fed. Okay. That's who gets it. So all I do is come over here. Brookville. \n\n\n\n15:12 | Myia\n\nOh yeah, we're in Silver Spring. \n\n\n\n15:17 | Shane\n\nTa da! \n\n\n\n15:19 | Myia\n\nI can send that on. Let me see. Hold on, hold on. I can send the address over to you. \n\n\n\n15:31 | Myia\n\nI don't know why it's popping up like that. It should be, the zip code should be two zero 910. Silver Spring, Maryland. \n\n\n\n15:45 | Myia\n\ni can't really we can kind of see how the book feel this but let me make sure on my end too. \n\n\n\n15:52 | Shane\n\nI mean because I have it. \n\n\n\n16:21 | Myia\n\nOkay. Alright, let me try to put that in. \n\n\n\n16:22 | Shane\n\nagain because I see now like the address that I have in the maps is. \n\n\n\n16:25 | Myia\n\nBecause I believe I was looking at this too. I was able to put in the address though. \n\n\n\n16:36 | Myia\n\nI usually say... \n\n\n\n16:51 | Myia\n\nAm I spelling that? Brookville, BROOKVILLE. Yeah. \n\n\n\n17:03 | Shane\n\nLet's try that. \n\n\n\n17:06 | Myia\n\nAll right. \n\n\n\n17:08 | Shane\n\nOh, wait. Okay. I think I have it here. There we go. So actually, yes. It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n# \u301018\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\nGreat. Sounds great. Okay. Yeah. Who do I, who do I work with? Moving forward from here? Is it you, Robin or\u2026 anyone else on your team? \n\n\n\n23:15 | Robin\n\nI think at a very early stage, you can just talk directly to me and Amber. And after that, if you want to go on site and, like I said, after we signed those agreements and move forward, we probably will arrange you with one of our local partner there. Itll be much easier for you and him to talk about this because he will be, probably, he live very close to the property. \n\n\n\n23:41 | Mark\n\nThats great. Our office by the way is super close to this. Its, yeah, were 20 minutes from this, which is great. We would be a lot closer if a great big boat didnt break the key bridge like literally. \n\n\n\n24:02 | Robin\n\nYeah, I remember that. \n\n\n\n24:04 | Mark\n\nYeah. We could probably get there in like 15 minutes if that bridge was open, but we have to go all the way around. So its gonna take a little longer, But it doesnt its really close to our office, which is what Im trying to say. \n\n\n\n24:14 | Robin\n\nNice. Thats so cool. Yeah. Okay. \n\n\n\n24:21 | Mark\n\nThats all I have folks. All right. Ill start some designs, send me over the bills. Give me some time, then we can schedule a man. I wish I could make an excuse to come up to your office and present in person. That would be a lot of fun, but I dont think theyre gonna pay for that so well have to do another Zoom, But I should have something out to you end of next week if that sounds good. \n\n\n\n24:46 | Robin\n\nThat sounds perfect. All right. Thank you for your time today. \n\n\n\n24:51 | Mark\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you all very much. \n\n\n\n24:53 | Robin\n\nHave a great weekend. \n\n\n\n24:54 | Mark\n\nOkay. You too. Bye bye.\n# \u301019\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n21:25 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think thats all that matches our initial thought, like started on early 20 25 and we will see, well, go from there. \n\n\n\n21:34 | Mark\n\nOkay. All right. So anything I can answer for you? Did we leave anything out? \n\n\n\n21:44 | Robin\n\nCould you repeat again, like besides of the 12 months, electrical bill, is there anything else or do you need for us right now? \n\n\n\n21:54 | Mark\n\nThe 12 month electric bill will get me started. Okay? And if you could, and Ill, see if I can find a utility map online that shows me where everything plugs in. If you could get me in touch with the property manager. \n\n\n\n22:14 | Robin\n\nGot it. Okay. All right. Ill, keep that in mind. \n\n\n\n22:17 | Mark\n\nYeah, Because what Ill need to do? I mean, I can give you a price for this. But if I dont know where Im, plugging it in, that price is going to potentially be really inaccurate. \n\n\n\n22:26 | Robin\n\nGot it. Thank you. \n\n\n\n22:28 | Mark\n\nMy pleasure. And then if I get you some numbers, you say, you know, what this is something we can do, Then we move forward and we all get our hands a little dirty. We go on site. We look at the structural, we look at the electrical, you know, you dont know if theres going to be some upgrades necessary. You know, we may find roofs that need work, but thats all after you basically look at the numbers and say this hurdles, this is an investment we want to make And you want to work with me? \n\n\n\n23:01 | Mark\n\nGreat. Sounds great. Okay. Yeah. Who do I, who do I work with? Moving forward from here? Is it you, Robin or\u2026 anyone else on your team? \n\n\n\n23:15 | Robin\n\nI think at a very early stage, you can just talk directly to me and Amber.

So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n\nWe have, we have one, two partners that, we have to like, we have to all agree on this decisions, but, they are all aware of this solar installation solutions. So, we just need to go back to them with the numbers and well, figure it out pretty quick. \n\n\n\n13:09 | Mark\n\nThat, that makes my life easy. And then it goes through there, Its contracting. Now, have you done solar on any other property or is this your first time? \n\n\n\n13:23 | Robin\n\nThis is our first time, actually. So thats why. \n\n\n\n13:26 | Mark\n\nOh, excellent. Where do you own properties? Because I can tell you if you own them in certain markets, theyre more lucrative than in other markets. So, for example, if you own properties in Washington, DC, your return is going to be double if not triple a system in Maryland. \n\n\n\n13:44 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think our partner has probably, probably on DC, but, like we are not always a partner on every product. Yeah. So, our investment, prior to this product, the property, it was, basically in Texas or North Carolina, someplace like that. Yeah. And Maryland, this is our first time doing investment there, So. \n\n\n\n14:10 | Mark\n\nGreat. Well, welcome to Maryland. Were very nice here and, were going to take care of you. Great. All right. So, heres what I would propose, You need to see some numbers. I need to get some information from you. Yes. Obviously, I need to get some electric bills, Right? If you could send those to me, 12 months is always good. Mm, hmm. And then I can put those into my models and look at what youre, paying, Look at what youre using. And then basically, from that information, I can tell you what well be able to, what solar will be able to do for you. Got it. I will design the buildings that if we did the project tomorrow, the site would be viable. And Im, looking at the site and it looks like we are, it looks like about half of them are good. I see some, like I said, the roofs are beautiful, brand new, And I see some that, you know, they probably look like they have about, You know, 10 ish years left on the warranty. And so thats really going to be your decision. Ill, show you what it looks like. But ultimately, youre, going to need to make that call. Okay. Yeah. So, and then really, I need to know where the meters are, because, for example, you know, Im, looking all the way back on this cul, de sac, This is going to be prime territory here. Im, going to use every single one of these buildings. And if the meter is at, for example, the front of the complex, its going to cost a good amount of money to get the power from the front or from the back, all the way to the front. And I can tell you thats probably going to be one of the bigger expenses, in this, in this project. So, if you have someone on site and if they could take this map and show me where some of these meters are. That would, that would help me in?\n",

Is it Shane? Yes. Nice to meet you. \n\n\n\n0:09 | Shane\n\nAll right. Nice to meet you. Glad you could take a little time. So in general, just to get started, you know, what do you do with the wider circle and what sort of, you know, the mission? I think I have an idea, you know, having researched the company and everything, but. \n\n\n\n0:29 | Myia\n\nYeah, so we just help those in need. We have a couple different programs. We have a furniture assistant program that also includes special appointments for babies. We have a PDC, which is professional clothing. We provide clothing to those that might need it. We also have a career development program that's really good at just providing like job fairs and just helping and coaching those who might be looking for work. And we also have a volunteer team, which is really great. We have volunteers almost here every day, just, you know, helping us with our daily operations. So it's just really nice to just have that support team give back in multiple different ways than one, you know, and it's really all it's about. We've been at this location ever since 2000, I believe we've been at this location ever since 2008, but we've been running for ever since 2001. We took ownership of this building in 2016 And then we installed the new roof in 20 21. \n\n\n\n1:36 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. Look at you just knocking out questions as you know I was going to ask anyway. Well that's good. I mean it's you know it's really important and as you were to potentially look at any sort of investment you know the roof span the lifespan is it's usually important and having only been a few years old you know the life expectancy of the roof and solar you know co align here very well so that's very good to know. So good and And sort of what is your role? \n\n\n\n2:10 | Myia\n\nMy role, I'm the operations manager. Okay. This is my new role so usually I just go around and I make sure you know the operations is up and running everything's going good at the facility and just also looking for any improvements you know that can be also add on to a wider circle. Okay, good. \n\n\n\n2:27 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. And then, you know, sort of before we get started into the questions that I'll have but. \n\n\n\n2:35 | Myia\n\nJust obviously, \n\n\n\n2:35 | Shane\n\nwe reached out to you, but typically, people respond having some background of solar or is this something that you guys have looked at previously? You know, what sort of things led, you know, to sit down with me today? \n\n\n\n2:50 | Myia\n\nWe're just something that we're considering. We know that it could probably help out with the PEPCO bill depending on how much of the savings analysis and I do know that there's just the savings incentives. We also believe, it's a possibility that we might be on a DC grid as well. So that's also that. So I don't know if the SRECs would come into play with that or it's, yeah, so... \n\n\n\n3:20 | Shane\n",

                "text": "\n38:23 | Myia\n\nOkay, no problem. Can you send me a screenshot of this map, like you said, the solar panel mapping? And then I also just have one more question. How much space is between each solar panel? \n\n\n\n38:35 | Shane\n\nSo in this case, we're using a five degree tilt. So there would be eight inches in between. As you'll see here again, if like if I zoom in to all of like HVAC and stuff, that is actually roughly a three foot setback that's going to go around all of those areas to make sure that you have ample space for any work that would need to be done to those. \n\n\n\n38:58 | Myia\n\nPerfect. \n\n\n\n38:59 | Shane\n\nYeah, so, and then we have, we ensure that there's going to be walkways, right, to any of that equipment. Okay. So, so as far as, yeah, being able to get up there and do what you guys need to do, you know, definitely. \n\n\n\n39:15 | Myia\n\nshould be pretty accessible. be accessible, yes, yes. \n\n\n\n39:19 | Shane\n\nCertain requirements around certain pieces of equipment that we abide by, and then, yeah, you know, the only thing I'll typically get tight on is maybe like a drain or something like that, where, you know, as long as it's not impeded, it's fine. \n\n\n\n39:37 | Myia\n\nAll right, well, that's perfect. I mean, I have all the information I need. I'm definitely going to try to work on getting you this bill sent. Yep. By the end of this week, hopefully we can get a send to you and then we can just go from there. Yep. And see where this can take us. I'm really hoping that it can work out. Yeah. \n\n\n\n39:53 | Shane\n\nI think there is a great opportunity for that to happen. You know, most importantly, once I have that, you know, we have the follow up call and I can more thoroughly educate you guys on how this works, what options, you know, and what they look like. You know, so that ultimately at the end of the day, I want you to say a very confident yes or a very confident no, you know, and at the end of the day, the faster I can do that and the faster you can make that decision, you know, the faster I'm either working for you or, you know, continuing my job to go and find other folks that want to say yes, it's perfectly fine, you know, and the faster that you're back, you know, doing what, you know, your main detail of your job, you know, entails. So, yeah. but I want to just make sure that you guys are, you know, fully educated and on board whatever you decide to do. That's the goal. \n\n\n\n40:49 | Myia\n\nWell, I appreciate that 100 percent. \n\n\n\n40:53 | Shane\n\nAll right, Myia. Well, look, again, I appreciate it. I'll keep my eyes peeled for that. And once we have it, we can schedule the next step. \n\n\n\n40:59 | Myia\n\nAll right. Looking forward to it. You have a nice one. \n\n\n\n41:03 | Shane\n\nYou too. Take care. Bye bye.\n",

It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n\nIt's pretty wild. Have you had experience with other commercial buildings being on the DC? Absolutely. In Maryland, how does that work out for you? Like, when you go to fill out that application form for whatever electricity service they're using, like how does it, is it good? Because I've been reading things and I know it's a little tricky once you kind of are in Maryland, but still on that line with solar panels. So how is that experience for your team? \n\n\n\n19:35 | Shane\n\nYeah, so it's actually fairly simple, you know, because we supply the interconnection documents to whichever PEPCO that you're attached to. So, you know, PEPCO, we submit to them. But when we apply for the SREC and set that up is where we're able to prove and use, you know, if you are indeed on the feeder line from D C.,. They then determine that your SRECs are to be sold via the DC market. Yeah, so that's sort of where it comes into play. Yeah, so it's less about the interconnection, more about you know, signing you up correctly on the SREC website. So yeah, we can verify, we can get that information, you know, it may require a little bit of legwork from you depending, you know, sometimes it's a little more straightforward and easy to see, but we would need to determine that. So yeah, but that's, it's great news. I mean, again, it's a great opportunity regardless, but again, there's no denying if indeed you're via the DC grid, it's a heck of a lot better. So, okay. All right. So what do you think the turnaround time would be for you to get me the PEPCO bill? \n\n\n\n21:05 | Myia\n",

Im, really glad, you reached out to us, give you a quick 10 second about who I am, and what we do. Ive, been doing this in Baltimore, D, C, Philadelphia, roughly for About 15 years. I live in Baltimore County, not very close to the proposed property, but I could probably get there in 20 25 minutes as needed. So, thats always a little helpful. We are Lumina, is, were an installer, we also, find, and fund projects with some partners. And so, whatever it is youre, looking to do, we should probably be able to work with you on it. And if not, for some reason, I could probably steer you in the direction of some people that could, so really, today, my thought is just tell me what I can do for you, tell me what youre, looking for, tell me how I can help and well, go through a few questions and that should probably dictate how we take it from here. \n\n\n\n3:37 | Robin\n\nOkay. Yeah, sure. So, do you want me to briefly introduce, what we are looking for? \n\n\n\n3:45 | Mark\n\nYep. Thats a great way to start? \n\n\n\n3:47 | Robin\n\nYeah. So, we recently got this, multi family apartment community, and theres, there are about, 20 20 buildings, in total and, the reason we are looking for at grid type solar panels on the roof is because like, we are trying to see if its, doable and, efficient to, covered the electricity bills by adding the solar panels on the roof. \n\n\n\n4:21 | Mark\n\nCan you give me the address again? I know I have it somewhere so I can look at it on Google Maps and take a look at what the roofs look like. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Robin\n\nLet me address and copy. \n\n\n\n4:44 | Robin\n\nI will just copy the address in the chat box. Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good.

And from there, I can't really say who else will be a part of that conversation, but I just know that, you know, I would bring information to Amy and, you know, I will present that to her and we will just see where we can kind of go from there. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Shane\n\nGot it. And Pepco Bills, it's not feeling good to you guys. You'd like to reduce that any way you can, right? Yes. All right. Okay. I think I have pretty much what I need there. So we have the roof age. We understand that. Let me get back and find you. \n\n\n\n6:47 | Shane\n\nso basically, yeah, I mean, at the beginning of this or at the end of this, I should say, you know, we want to have the idea that yes, this makes sense to move forward and have that conversation, with the CEO. You know, I personally am, a business consultant, you know, developer. So I'm looking at the different ways, that Lumina can help you out. The beauty of sort of what we do as what we would consider an EPC, you were, you know, going to engineer, procure, construct, this system is, we have the multiple different ways to go about that. So no matter whether you wanted to take a loan, whether you wanted to pay cash, whether you wanted to do like a power purchase agreement, we'll get into those things in a moment. We, have the ability to do all of those things. You know, whereas most are sort of aligned with one of them, and want to lead, you know, the direction that they want. the beauty with us is that we really want to educate you on all things solar, you know, give you sort of the opportunities and make the suggestions as we see fit as to what we think would be the best for you, but ultimately the decisions in your hands and we can sort of handle any avenue that you want to, to take. And, you know, we've been doing this, you know, for a very long time. Actually, I think right around the corner from you guys, Sandy Springs Meeting House, we just did solar there, which was a very small project, but we've done targets, Coca Cola, you know, our portfolio is very robust in, you know, size and scale. But we're local. We like to do jobs for local folks and, you know, nonprofits are, you know, a big, piece, of where we feel we can make, a huge impact given what you guys do and what solar can do for your business. So, as far as, your bill, I will need to get a copy of that from you. That's going to sort of allow me to see and understand how much electricity you're using. I can calculate out what you're currently paying, per kilowatt hour, and then be able to also, you know, convert that into what sort of savings, you know, would look like. Are you familiar with sort of the forms or ways that you can go about, investing in solar, you know, No, I'm not. So let's go real high level. There's basically three big buckets.\n",

So I like to just kind of run through a few of these early questions. It helps us sort of understand, you know, throughout the process what we're dealing with and those sorts of things. So, you know, it sounds like, you know, one of the main metrics that you're after is cost savings. Are there any other, you know, reasons that you look at going solar, you know, right now? \n\n\n\n4:38 | Myia\n\nI believe cost savings is the big one. Just with that monthly cost savings and just seeing if we would be able to get any return back from savings to kind of add because we are a non profit. So it would be nice if we can just add funds to that bowl of funds that we do have for our team. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Shane\n\nGot it. And who ultimately makes the decisions based around something like this? \n\n\n\n5:05 | Myia\n\nIt would probably be our CEO. So we would have this discussion.

Okay. I guess the next big question is who do you want to own this system? Do you want to buy it? Do you want to lease it? What is your strategy for this? \n\n\n\n9:30 | Robin\n\nWhen you talk about lease, are you talking about financing or just like car lease or something like that? \n\n\n\n9:36 | Mark\n\nOkay. So first option for you is going to be buying it outright, Right? You, you spend the money, the panels go on the roof. These panels are essentially an investment for you, Right? You know, I can run a pro forma, show you what the tax credits are, show you, what the payback period is, what your IRR is going to be. And all of those financial, you guys are, you folks are money people, you know this better than me. So whatever your investment hurdle is, whatever makes sense for you in terms of how you use your capital, I would give you that number, so you could decide if this was an investment worth putting your money into. The question. Is theres a third party that comes in, the third party owns the system. They take advantage of all the incentives. So the incentives that would normally go to you during the process, go to them. The solar on the roof produces electricity. It powers the buildings just like it would if you own it. But the people that own the system, Well, charge you a reduced rate for the electricity. \n\n\n\n10:54 | Robin\n\nGot it. Yeah, I dont think, I think Ill, probably will stick to that. We, as the owner of the equipment. So you want to buy it. Yeah. \n\n\n\n11:03 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thats that is easier. Actually. All right. So basically, Im trying to understand really what youre looking for here is you want to get the electric bill as low as you can, Right? Exactly. I will tell you that, Im guessing the electric bill here is pretty substantial. And as I look at the roof, I, you know, I can tell you right now, youre not going to be able to eliminate all of it, You know, with this project still being viable, if you could eliminate, you know? \n\n\n\n11:41 | Robin\n\nOkay. Got it. \n\n\n\n11:44 | Mark\n\nWell, thats a question. Do you think that it will be worth your time? Or is that not enough to really make you interested? \n\n\n\n11:53 | Robin\n\nI mean, I have to try to balance out the payment for the equipment and how like whats the real saving for us? Because I, we are not expert here you are. So I have to figure out, yeah, I have to look at the numbers and try to see if that makes sense Because its kind of hard for me to decide it right now. \n\n\n\n12:18 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Basically, a lot of times people will expect the solar to just completely eliminate the bill And I asked that question up front to temper expectations. Yeah. \n\n\n\n12:31 | Robin\n\nSo we have the expectation that it might not be able to eliminate all the usage, but thats fine with us Just trying to see if the number makes sense? \n\n\n\n12:41 | Mark\n\nMaking sure, making sure that all makes sense. So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n",

Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, Our property manager is Donaldsons. \n\n\n\n6:41 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thank you. Yeah, thats always good for me. Good to know. All right. So then youre looking to save money on the electric bill. So, does that mean that these buildings are metered in such a way that you pay the electric bill for the tenants? \n\n\n\n7:01 | Robin\n\nYeah. The tenants, the rents that pay by tenants are included with utility costs. Yeah, Which means that were paying for all the utility costs. \n\n\n\n7:11 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Understood. All right. So, these 20 buildings here, how are they metered? Right? How does BG, E, how many meters, I suppose is, what Im really looking to ask on these buildings? \n\n\n\n7:30 | Robin\n\nI think we have two meters probably, but I have to get back to you on that one though. Yeah, because Ill have to answer once my partner send it over with the past 12 months, electrical bills? \n\n\n\n7:44 | Mark\n\nYep. Okay. So, all right. So theres two meters and Ill, probably if I can figure out where they are, that will help me a lot because obviously were going to need to get the power from the roof to the meter. And I dont know the property that well. So I cant really give you any insight into that. Okay? So you pay the electric bill, you own the buildings, the tenants have the electric bill included in their rent. These roofs, a lot of them look new. Some of them look like they need some work. And then obviously, we have some trees that are shading some of the properties as well. Do you want me to focus on sort of, you know, like the low hanging fruit, what we can install, you know, tomorrow if we needed to, or are you going to explore fixing or replacing some of these roofs? \n\n\n\n8:44 | Robin\n",

I can send the address over to you. \n\n\n\n15:31 | Myia\n\nI don't know why it's popping up like that. It should be, the zip code should be two zero 910. Silver Spring, Maryland. \n\n\n\n15:45 | Myia\n\ni can't really we can kind of see how the book feel this but let me make sure on my end too. \n\n\n\n15:52 | Shane\n\nI mean because I have it. \n\n\n\n16:21 | Myia\n\nOkay. Alright, let me try to put that in. \n\n\n\n16:22 | Shane\n\nagain because I see now like the address that I have in the maps is. \n\n\n\n16:25 | Myia\n\nBecause I believe I was looking at this too. I was able to put in the address though. \n\n\n\n16:36 | Myia\n\nI usually say... \n\n\n\n16:51 | Myia\n\nAm I spelling that? Brookville, BROOKVILLE. Yeah. \n\n\n\n17:03 | Shane\n\nLet's try that. \n\n\n\n17:06 | Myia\n\nAll right. \n\n\n\n17:08 | Shane\n\nOh, wait. Okay. I think I have it here. There we go. So actually, yes. It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n",

All right. So anything I can answer for you? Did we leave anything out? \n\n\n\n21:44 | Robin\n\nCould you repeat again, like besides of the 12 months, electrical bill, is there anything else or do you need for us right now? \n\n\n\n21:54 | Mark\n\nThe 12 month electric bill will get me started.

So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n\nWe have, we have one, two partners that, we have to like, we have to all agree on this decisions, but, they are all aware of this solar installation solutions. So, we just need to go back to them with the numbers and well, figure it out pretty quick. \n\n\n\n13:09 | Mark\n\nThat, that makes my life easy. And then it goes through there, Its contracting. Now, have you done solar on any other property or is this your first time? \n\n\n\n13:23 | Robin\n\nThis is our first time, actually. So thats why. \n\n\n\n13:26 | Mark\n\nOh, excellent. Where do you own properties? Because I can tell you if you own them in certain markets, theyre more lucrative than in other markets. So, for example, if you own properties in Washington, DC, your return is going to be double if not triple a system in Maryland. \n\n\n\n13:44 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think our partner has probably, probably on DC, but, like we are not always a partner on every product. Yeah. So, our investment, prior to this product, the property, it was, basically in Texas or North Carolina, someplace like that. Yeah. And Maryland, this is our first time doing investment there, So. \n\n\n\n14:10 | Mark\n\nGreat. Well, welcome to Maryland. Were very nice here and, were going to take care of you. Great. All right. So, heres what I would propose, You need to see some numbers. I need to get some information from you. Yes. Obviously, I need to get some electric bills, Right? If you could send those to me, 12 months is always good. Mm, hmm. And then I can put those into my models and look at what youre, paying, Look at what youre using. And then basically, from that information, I can tell you what well be able to, what solar will be able to do for you. Got it. I will design the buildings that if we did the project tomorrow, the site would be viable. And Im, looking at the site and it looks like we are, it looks like about half of them are good. I see some, like I said, the roofs are beautiful, brand new, And I see some that, you know, they probably look like they have about, You know, 10 ish years left on the warranty. And so thats really going to be your decision. Ill, show you what it looks like. But ultimately, youre, going to need to make that call. Okay. Yeah. So, and then really, I need to know where the meters are, because, for example, you know, Im, looking all the way back on this cul, de sac, This is going to be prime territory here. Im, going to use every single one of these buildings. And if the meter is at, for example, the front of the complex, its going to cost a good amount of money to get the power from the front or from the back, all the way to the front. And I can tell you thats probably going to be one of the bigger expenses, in this, in this project. So, if you have someone on site and if they could take this map and show me where some of these meters are. That would, that would help me in?\n# \u30101\u2020Discovery Call Template v1 (10.9.24 MPM).docx\u2020file-TzmA3qVo30CRpACYBheQNM46\u3011\n### **Discovery Call Template (MEDPICC Framework)**\n\n\n\n**1.

Is it Shane? Yes. Nice to meet you. \n\n\n\n0:09 | Shane\n\nAll right. Nice to meet you. Glad you could take a little time. So in general, just to get started, you know, what do you do with the wider circle and what sort of, you know, the mission? I think I have an idea, you know, having researched the company and everything, but. \n\n\n\n0:29 | Myia\n\nYeah, so we just help those in need. We have a couple different programs. We have a furniture assistant program that also includes special appointments for babies. We have a PDC, which is professional clothing. We provide clothing to those that might need it. We also have a career development program that's really good at just providing like job fairs and just helping and coaching those who might be looking for work. And we also have a volunteer team, which is really great. We have volunteers almost here every day, just, you know, helping us with our daily operations. So it's just really nice to just have that support team give back in multiple different ways than one, you know, and it's really all it's about. We've been at this location ever since 2000, I believe we've been at this location ever since 2008, but we've been running for ever since 2001. We took ownership of this building in 2016 And then we installed the new roof in 20 21. \n\n\n\n1:36 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. Look at you just knocking out questions as you know I was going to ask anyway. Well that's good. I mean it's you know it's really important and as you were to potentially look at any sort of investment you know the roof span the lifespan is it's usually important and having only been a few years old you know the life expectancy of the roof and solar you know co align here very well so that's very good to know. So good and And sort of what is your role? \n\n\n\n2:10 | Myia\n\nMy role, I'm the operations manager. Okay. This is my new role so usually I just go around and I make sure you know the operations is up and running everything's going good at the facility and just also looking for any improvements you know that can be also add on to a wider circle. Okay, good. \n\n\n\n2:27 | Shane\n\nBeautiful. And then, you know, sort of before we get started into the questions that I'll have but. \n\n\n\n2:35 | Myia\n\nJust obviously, \n\n\n\n2:35 | Shane\n\nwe reached out to you, but typically, people respond having some background of solar or is this something that you guys have looked at previously? You know, what sort of things led, you know, to sit down with me today? \n\n\n\n2:50 | Myia\n\nWe're just something that we're considering. We know that it could probably help out with the PEPCO bill depending on how much of the savings analysis and I do know that there's just the savings incentives. We also believe, it's a possibility that we might be on a DC grid as well. So that's also that. So I don't know if the SRECs would come into play with that or it's, yeah, so... \n\n\n\n3:20 | Shane\n# \u30104\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n38:23 | Myia\n\nOkay, no problem. Can you send me a screenshot of this map, like you said, the solar panel mapping? And then I also just have one more question. How much space is between each solar panel? \n\n\n\n38:35 | Shane\n\nSo in this case, we're using a five degree tilt. So there would be eight inches in between. As you'll see here again, if like if I zoom in to all of like HVAC and stuff, that is actually roughly a three foot setback that's going to go around all of those areas to make sure that you have ample space for any work that would need to be done to those. \n\n\n\n38:58 | Myia\n\nPerfect. \n\n\n\n38:59 | Shane\n\nYeah, so, and then we have, we ensure that there's going to be walkways, right, to any of that equipment. Okay. So, so as far as, yeah, being able to get up there and do what you guys need to do, you know, definitely. \n\n\n\n39:15 | Myia\n\nshould be pretty accessible. be accessible, yes, yes. \n\n\n\n39:19 | Shane\n\nCertain requirements around certain pieces of equipment that we abide by, and then, yeah, you know, the only thing I'll typically get tight on is maybe like a drain or something like that, where, you know, as long as it's not impeded, it's fine. \n\n\n\n39:37 | Myia\n\nAll right, well, that's perfect. I mean, I have all the information I need. I'm definitely going to try to work on getting you this bill sent. Yep. By the end of this week, hopefully we can get a send to you and then we can just go from there. Yep. And see where this can take us. I'm really hoping that it can work out. Yeah. \n\n\n\n39:53 | Shane\n\nI think there is a great opportunity for that to happen. You know, most importantly, once I have that, you know, we have the follow up call and I can more thoroughly educate you guys on how this works, what options, you know, and what they look like. You know, so that ultimately at the end of the day, I want you to say a very confident yes or a very confident no, you know, and at the end of the day, the faster I can do that and the faster you can make that decision, you know, the faster I'm either working for you or, you know, continuing my job to go and find other folks that want to say yes, it's perfectly fine, you know, and the faster that you're back, you know, doing what, you know, your main detail of your job, you know, entails. So, yeah. but I want to just make sure that you guys are, you know, fully educated and on board whatever you decide to do. That's the goal. \n\n\n\n40:49 | Myia\n\nWell, I appreciate that 100 percent. \n\n\n\n40:53 | Shane\n\nAll right, Myia. Well, look, again, I appreciate it. I'll keep my eyes peeled for that. And once we have it, we can schedule the next step. \n\n\n\n40:59 | Myia\n\nAll right. Looking forward to it. You have a nice one. \n\n\n\n41:03 | Shane\n\nYou too. Take care.

Okay. I think I have it here. There we go. So actually, yes. It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n\nIt's pretty wild. Have you had experience with other commercial buildings being on the DC? Absolutely. In Maryland, how does that work out for you? Like, when you go to fill out that application form for whatever electricity service they're using, like how does it, is it good? Because I've been reading things and I know it's a little tricky once you kind of are in Maryland, but still on that line with solar panels. So how is that experience for your team? \n\n\n\n19:35 | Shane\n\nYeah, so it's actually fairly simple, you know, because we supply the interconnection documents to whichever PEPCO that you're attached to. So, you know, PEPCO, we submit to them. But when we apply for the SREC and set that up is where we're able to prove and use, you know, if you are indeed on the feeder line from D C.,. They then determine that your SRECs are to be sold via the DC market. Yeah, so that's sort of where it comes into play. Yeah, so it's less about the interconnection, more about you know, signing you up correctly on the SREC website. So yeah, we can verify, we can get that information, you know, it may require a little bit of legwork from you depending, you know, sometimes it's a little more straightforward and easy to see, but we would need to determine that. So yeah, but that's, it's great news. I mean, again, it's a great opportunity regardless, but again, there's no denying if indeed you're via the DC grid, it's a heck of a lot better. So, okay. All right. So what do you think the turnaround time would be for you to get me the PEPCO bill? \n\n\n\n21:05 | Myia\n# \u301012\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n2:15 | Mark\n\nNew York, is gonna get, I just remember its always tough, between now and the end of the year. So, anyway, so weve got about a half an hour. Im, really glad, you reached out to us, give you a quick 10 second about who I am, and what we do. Ive, been doing this in Baltimore, D, C, Philadelphia, roughly for About 15 years. I live in Baltimore County, not very close to the proposed property, but I could probably get there in 20 25 minutes as needed. So, thats always a little helpful. We are Lumina, is, were an installer, we also, find, and fund projects with some partners. And so, whatever it is youre, looking to do, we should probably be able to work with you on it. And if not, for some reason, I could probably steer you in the direction of some people that could, so really, today, my thought is just tell me what I can do for you, tell me what youre, looking for, tell me how I can help and well, go through a few questions and that should probably dictate how we take it from here. \n\n\n\n3:37 | Robin\n\nOkay. Yeah, sure. So, do you want me to briefly introduce, what we are looking for? \n\n\n\n3:45 | Mark\n\nYep. Thats a great way to start? \n\n\n\n3:47 | Robin\n\nYeah. So, we recently got this, multi family apartment community, and theres, there are about, 20 20 buildings, in total and, the reason we are looking for at grid type solar panels on the roof is because like, we are trying to see if its, doable and, efficient to, covered the electricity bills by adding the solar panels on the roof. \n\n\n\n4:21 | Mark\n\nCan you give me the address again? I know I have it somewhere so I can look at it on Google Maps and take a look at what the roofs look like. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Robin\n\nLet me address and copy. \n\n\n\n4:44 | Robin\n\nI will just copy the address in the chat box. Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, Our property manager is Donaldsons. \n\n\n\n6:41 | Mark\n# \u301013\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n5:34 | Shane\n\nOkay, and so you kind of helped me with, you know, the next steps in that. As far as the decision making process, will she meet with any board members? You know, how does it sort of fall into players that just come onto her desk and she's sort of the... \n\n\n\n5:51 | Myia\n\nI definitely think it's a still wider conversation, but I think that that's the initiation of that conversation. And from there, I can't really say who else will be a part of that conversation, but I just know that, you know, I would bring information to Amy and, you know, I will present that to her and we will just see where we can kind of go from there. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Shane\n\nGot it. And Pepco Bills, it's not feeling good to you guys. You'd like to reduce that any way you can, right? Yes. All right. Okay. I think I have pretty much what I need there. So we have the roof age. We understand that. Let me get back and find you. \n\n\n\n6:47 | Shane\n\nso basically, yeah, I mean, at the beginning of this or at the end of this, I should say, you know, we want to have the idea that yes, this makes sense to move forward and have that conversation, with the CEO. You know, I personally am, a business consultant, you know, developer. So I'm looking at the different ways, that Lumina can help you out. The beauty of sort of what we do as what we would consider an EPC, you were, you know, going to engineer, procure, construct, this system is, we have the multiple different ways to go about that. So no matter whether you wanted to take a loan, whether you wanted to pay cash, whether you wanted to do like a power purchase agreement, we'll get into those things in a moment. We, have the ability to do all of those things. You know, whereas most are sort of aligned with one of them, and want to lead, you know, the direction that they want. the beauty with us is that we really want to educate you on all things solar, you know, give you sort of the opportunities and make the suggestions as we see fit as to what we think would be the best for you, but ultimately the decisions in your hands and we can sort of handle any avenue that you want to, to take. And, you know, we've been doing this, you know, for a very long time. Actually, I think right around the corner from you guys, Sandy Springs Meeting House, we just did solar there, which was a very small project, but we've done targets, Coca Cola, you know, our portfolio is very robust in, you know, size and scale. But we're local. We like to do jobs for local folks and, you know, nonprofits are, you know, a big, piece, of where we feel we can make, a huge impact given what you guys do and what solar can do for your business. So, as far as, your bill, I will need to get a copy of that from you. That's going to sort of allow me to see and understand how much electricity you're using. I can calculate out what you're currently paying, per kilowatt hour, and then be able to also, you know, convert that into what sort of savings, you know, would look like. Are you familiar with sort of the forms or ways that you can go about, investing in solar, you know, No, I'm not. So let's go real high level. There's basically three big buckets.\n# \u301014\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n3:20 | Shane\n\nI have this fancy pants map. OK. That will tell us. So let me go ahead. \n\n\n\n3:32 | Myia\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n3:40 | Shane\n\nI thought you guys would have been... Yeah. So you're too far north for the SRECs, for DC SRECs. That doesn't mean that you're not getting SRECs. They're just going to be valued at the Maryland, you know, the Maryland value. OK. \n\n\n\n4:02 | Myia\n\nAnd what address do you have? \n\n\n\n4:05 | Shane\n\nthis. 91 59 Brookville. \n\n\n\n4:07 | Myia\n\nYes. OK. \n\n\n\n4:10 | Shane\n\nYeah. All right. So I like to just kind of run through a few of these early questions. It helps us sort of understand, you know, throughout the process what we're dealing with and those sorts of things. So, you know, it sounds like, you know, one of the main metrics that you're after is cost savings. Are there any other, you know, reasons that you look at going solar, you know, right now? \n\n\n\n4:38 | Myia\n\nI believe cost savings is the big one. Just with that monthly cost savings and just seeing if we would be able to get any return back from savings to kind of add because we are a non profit. So it would be nice if we can just add funds to that bowl of funds that we do have for our team. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Shane\n\nGot it. And who ultimately makes the decisions based around something like this? \n\n\n\n5:05 | Myia\n\nIt would probably be our CEO. So we would have this discussion. I would, you know, bring her information and based off of what she's read and we can have a discussion based off of, you know, what you're saying, other people are saying. And from there, she would kind of, you know, make a decision depending on the price costing, you know, whatever we can gather from this meeting today and then kind of see if we need to have another one if necessary to get, you know, any questions, you know, cleared up. \n\n\n\n5:34 | Shane\n\nOkay, and so you kind of helped me with, you know, the next steps in that. As far as the decision making process, will she meet with any board members? You know, how does it sort of fall into players that just come onto her desk and she's sort of the... \n\n\n\n5:51 | Myia\n\nI definitely think it's a still wider conversation, but I think that that's the initiation of that conversation. And from there, I can't really say who else will be a part of that conversation, but I just know that, you know, I would bring information to Amy and, you know, I will present that to her and we will just see where we can kind of go from there. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Shane\n\nGot it. And Pepco Bills, it's not feeling good to you guys. You'd like to reduce that any way you can, right? Yes. All right. Okay. I think I have pretty much what I need there. So we have the roof age. We understand that. Let me get back and find you. \n\n\n\n6:47 | Shane\n\nso basically, yeah, I mean, at the beginning of this or at the end of this, I should say, you know, we want to have the idea that yes, this makes sense to move forward and have that conversation, with the CEO. You know, I personally am, a business consultant, you know, developer.\n# \u301015\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n9:05 | Mark\n\nUnderstood. Okay. So in terms of installation, any, just double check any installation that any surface that works is okay to install on, correct. Right? Okay. I guess the next big question is who do you want to own this system? Do you want to buy it? Do you want to lease it? What is your strategy for this? \n\n\n\n9:30 | Robin\n\nWhen you talk about lease, are you talking about financing or just like car lease or something like that? \n\n\n\n9:36 | Mark\n\nOkay. So first option for you is going to be buying it outright, Right? You, you spend the money, the panels go on the roof. These panels are essentially an investment for you, Right? You know, I can run a pro forma, show you what the tax credits are, show you, what the payback period is, what your IRR is going to be. And all of those financial, you guys are, you folks are money people, you know this better than me. So whatever your investment hurdle is, whatever makes sense for you in terms of how you use your capital, I would give you that number, so you could decide if this was an investment worth putting your money into. The question. Is theres a third party that comes in, the third party owns the system. They take advantage of all the incentives. So the incentives that would normally go to you during the process, go to them. The solar on the roof produces electricity. It powers the buildings just like it would if you own it. But the people that own the system, Well, charge you a reduced rate for the electricity. \n\n\n\n10:54 | Robin\n\nGot it. Yeah, I dont think, I think Ill, probably will stick to that. We, as the owner of the equipment. So you want to buy it. Yeah. \n\n\n\n11:03 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thats that is easier. Actually. All right. So basically, Im trying to understand really what youre looking for here is you want to get the electric bill as low as you can, Right? Exactly. I will tell you that, Im guessing the electric bill here is pretty substantial. And as I look at the roof, I, you know, I can tell you right now, youre not going to be able to eliminate all of it, You know, with this project still being viable, if you could eliminate, you know? \n\n\n\n11:41 | Robin\n\nOkay. Got it. \n\n\n\n11:44 | Mark\n\nWell, thats a question. Do you think that it will be worth your time? Or is that not enough to really make you interested? \n\n\n\n11:53 | Robin\n\nI mean, I have to try to balance out the payment for the equipment and how like whats the real saving for us? Because I, we are not expert here you are. So I have to figure out, yeah, I have to look at the numbers and try to see if that makes sense Because its kind of hard for me to decide it right now. \n\n\n\n12:18 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Basically, a lot of times people will expect the solar to just completely eliminate the bill And I asked that question up front to temper expectations. Yeah. \n\n\n\n12:31 | Robin\n\nSo we have the expectation that it might not be able to eliminate all the usage, but thats fine with us Just trying to see if the number makes sense? \n\n\n\n12:41 | Mark\n\nMaking sure, making sure that all makes sense. So, basically, this is, do you have an investment committee or are you two the investment committee? \n\n\n\n12:49 | Robin\n# \u301016\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n4:21 | Mark\n\nCan you give me the address again? I know I have it somewhere so I can look at it on Google Maps and take a look at what the roofs look like. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Robin\n\nLet me address and copy. \n\n\n\n4:44 | Robin\n\nI will just copy the address in the chat box. Great. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Mark\n\nSix. \n\n\n\n5:04 | Mark\n\nIm, taking a look at that now Here, you know, what? Ill, even share my screen, so we can look at it together. \n\n\n\n5:24 | Robin\n\nYeah, I can see your screen, Right? Okay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Mark\n\nCool. All right. So, okay. So, this is the community like right here, Does it basically start here and sort of go in these gray roofs around right here? Is that kind of what it is? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. So, who owns this property? \n\n\n\n6:03 | Robin\n\nWe own this property? \n\n\n\n6:05 | Mark\n\nOkay. So, you own the property? Yeah. So, you own it and you manage it, right? \n\n\n\n6:10 | Robin\n\nWe hire a third party property management to do like the daily operation for us. \n\n\n\n6:19 | Mark\n\nOkay. Who are they? Just probably need to talk to them a little bit. \n\n\n\n6:26 | Robin\n\nIts Donaldson? Donaldsons? \n\n\n\n6:33 | Robin\n\nHey, Mark, Its Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, Our property manager is Donaldsons. \n\n\n\n6:41 | Mark\n\nOkay. Thank you. Yeah, thats always good for me. Good to know. All right. So then youre looking to save money on the electric bill. So, does that mean that these buildings are metered in such a way that you pay the electric bill for the tenants? \n\n\n\n7:01 | Robin\n\nYeah. The tenants, the rents that pay by tenants are included with utility costs. Yeah, Which means that were paying for all the utility costs. \n\n\n\n7:11 | Mark\n\nPerfect. Understood. All right. So, these 20 buildings here, how are they metered? Right? How does BG, E, how many meters, I suppose is, what Im really looking to ask on these buildings? \n\n\n\n7:30 | Robin\n\nI think we have two meters probably, but I have to get back to you on that one though. Yeah, because Ill have to answer once my partner send it over with the past 12 months, electrical bills? \n\n\n\n7:44 | Mark\n\nYep. Okay. So, all right. So theres two meters and Ill, probably if I can figure out where they are, that will help me a lot because obviously were going to need to get the power from the roof to the meter. And I dont know the property that well. So I cant really give you any insight into that. Okay? So you pay the electric bill, you own the buildings, the tenants have the electric bill included in their rent. These roofs, a lot of them look new. Some of them look like they need some work. And then obviously, we have some trees that are shading some of the properties as well. Do you want me to focus on sort of, you know, like the low hanging fruit, what we can install, you know, tomorrow if we needed to, or are you going to explore fixing or replacing some of these roofs? \n\n\n\n8:44 | Robin\n# \u301017\u2020Shane's Call.docx\u2020file-rz0E6GOUQVFAWGK6eNH28H6I\u3011\n14:29 | Shane\n\nYeah. So you do have, I'm almost certain this has public access. I could even share the link. But this is so you see this blue lines here, right? Those are basically the feeder lines around DC and anything that goes over that line into the Maryland side that are fed. Okay. That's who gets it. So all I do is come over here. Brookville. \n\n\n\n15:12 | Myia\n\nOh yeah, we're in Silver Spring. \n\n\n\n15:17 | Shane\n\nTa da! \n\n\n\n15:19 | Myia\n\nI can send that on. Let me see. Hold on, hold on. I can send the address over to you. \n\n\n\n15:31 | Myia\n\nI don't know why it's popping up like that. It should be, the zip code should be two zero 910. Silver Spring, Maryland. \n\n\n\n15:45 | Myia\n\ni can't really we can kind of see how the book feel this but let me make sure on my end too. \n\n\n\n15:52 | Shane\n\nI mean because I have it. \n\n\n\n16:21 | Myia\n\nOkay. Alright, let me try to put that in. \n\n\n\n16:22 | Shane\n\nagain because I see now like the address that I have in the maps is. \n\n\n\n16:25 | Myia\n\nBecause I believe I was looking at this too. I was able to put in the address though. \n\n\n\n16:36 | Myia\n\nI usually say... \n\n\n\n16:51 | Myia\n\nAm I spelling that? Brookville, BROOKVILLE. Yeah. \n\n\n\n17:03 | Shane\n\nLet's try that. \n\n\n\n17:06 | Myia\n\nAll right. \n\n\n\n17:08 | Shane\n\nOh, wait. Okay. I think I have it here. There we go. So actually, yes. It makes a big difference in things. of what we could potentially offer. Let me see. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Shane\n\nSo I may need to get some further clarity on it. It looks, yes, but if you'll see some of these secondary lines that are here, and you can see how they come off, yeah so it's really close and we would need to verify which. \n\n\n\n17:56 | Myia\n\nI'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go, go, go. I did like do, because I looked on this map and I saw where the lines were, so I did look from the, we're looking at the very top right here, I did see one line that was connected, but again there's, since there's that brown and blue line, I'm not really sure which one is connecting to our building, and then we also have another one that's facing from the front that's connected, okay and I believe one one feeder it's like a really thick line so I think we have two what I'm seeing is two connectors and then one feeder line. \n\n\n\n18:34 | Shane\n\nOkay. And these are two separate buildings, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let me, I'm pretty sure, we can look that up. So I'll see what I can do there because obviously we want to make sure, that's a significant difference. All options are still on the table. It's just the kilowatt hour rate would effectively be like, it'd be like a penny. \n\n\n\n19:07 | Myia\n# \u301018\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\nGreat. Sounds great. Okay. Yeah. Who do I, who do I work with? Moving forward from here? Is it you, Robin or\u2026 anyone else on your team? \n\n\n\n23:15 | Robin\n\nI think at a very early stage, you can just talk directly to me and Amber. And after that, if you want to go on site and, like I said, after we signed those agreements and move forward, we probably will arrange you with one of our local partner there. Itll be much easier for you and him to talk about this because he will be, probably, he live very close to the property. \n\n\n\n23:41 | Mark\n\nThats great. Our office by the way is super close to this. Its, yeah, were 20 minutes from this, which is great. We would be a lot closer if a great big boat didnt break the key bridge like literally. \n\n\n\n24:02 | Robin\n\nYeah, I remember that. \n\n\n\n24:04 | Mark\n\nYeah. We could probably get there in like 15 minutes if that bridge was open, but we have to go all the way around. So its gonna take a little longer, But it doesnt its really close to our office, which is what Im trying to say. \n\n\n\n24:14 | Robin\n\nNice. Thats so cool. Yeah. Okay. \n\n\n\n24:21 | Mark\n\nThats all I have folks. All right. Ill start some designs, send me over the bills. Give me some time, then we can schedule a man. I wish I could make an excuse to come up to your office and present in person. That would be a lot of fun, but I dont think theyre gonna pay for that so well have to do another Zoom, But I should have something out to you end of next week if that sounds good. \n\n\n\n24:46 | Robin\n\nThat sounds perfect. All right. Thank you for your time today. \n\n\n\n24:51 | Mark\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you all very much. \n\n\n\n24:53 | Robin\n\nHave a great weekend. \n\n\n\n24:54 | Mark\n\nOkay. You too. Bye bye.\n# \u301019\u2020Mark's Call.docx\u2020file-ts7nlRx3WH8wsFm3T8Fr0iXh\u3011\n21:25 | Robin\n\nOkay. I think thats all that matches our initial thought, like started on early 20 25 and we will see, well, go from there. \n\n\n\n21:34 | Mark\n\nOkay. All right. So anything I can answer for you? Did we leave anything out? \n\n\n\n21:44 | Robin\n\nCould you repeat again, like besides of the 12 months, electrical bill, is there anything else or do you need for us right now? \n\n\n\n21:54 | Mark\n\nThe 12 month electric bill will get me started. Okay? And if you could, and Ill, see if I can find a utility map online that shows me where everything plugs in. If you could get me in touch with the property manager. \n\n\n\n22:14 | Robin\n\nGot it. Okay. All right. Ill, keep that in mind. \n\n\n\n22:17 | Mark\n\nYeah, Because what Ill need to do? I mean, I can give you a price for this. But if I dont know where Im, plugging it in, that price is going to potentially be really inaccurate. \n\n\n\n22:26 | Robin\n\nGot it. Thank you. \n\n\n\n22:28 | Mark\n\nMy pleasure. And then if I get you some numbers, you say, you know, what this is something we can do, Then we move forward and we all get our hands a little dirty. We go on site. We look at the structural, we look at the electrical, you know, you dont know if theres going to be some upgrades necessary. You know, we may find roofs that need work, but thats all after you basically look at the numbers and say this hurdles, this is an investment we want to make And you want to work with me? \n\n\n\n23:01 | Mark\n\nGreat. Sounds great. Okay. Yeah. Who do I, who do I work with? Moving forward from here? Is it you, Robin or\u2026 anyone else on your team? \n\n\n\n23:15 | Robin\n\nI think at a very early stage, you can just talk directly to me and Amber.

I think these are all note takers that are in here. Yeah. \n\n\n\n1:36 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIts easy enough to add but you cant get rid of it. Oh, yeah. So Im sorry about that too, but its just not showing. \n\n\n\n1:45 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAs long as you can see me, okay? And hear me. I think we should be good to go. Excellent. Okay. Yeah, Dont worry about the rest. Well, very nice to meet you. My name is Phil Jordan. Im, one of the project managers here at. Lumina Solar. We operate in the Mid Atlantic, Maryland, being our primary state. Im, sitting in our office here in Hillthorpe right outside of Baltimore. \n\n\n\n2:08 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. Im, in Frederick. \n\n\n\n2:10 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNice. So we install turnkey residential and commercial solar projects. And weve been doing this for a long time. Ive been in the industry for approaching my eighth year, which is exciting. I started in residential and switched over to commercial a couple years ago. And what weve found is theres a lot of Maryland incentives. They change constantly. But right now, Maryland just released a few months ago, their commercial solar grant program for 20 25. And their primary area of interest is getting solar on organizations that are either owned women\u2026 owned enterprises or low or owned by nonprofit organizations. And their primary goal is to promote these businesses, and get in the award grants based on the total solar system size thats installed or women. So, Ive been kind of, Ive been targeting or looking at areas within the Baltimore area primarily because those are the regions that seem to qualify for this grant. I came across your business and it seems like you were very involved in the environmental industry, which was exciting to find out And it looked like a great rooftop to put solar on and get and hopefully get you awarded this grant. \n\n\n\n3:36 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOh, good. Okay. I understand. I have no idea how it all works. Im, kind of busy. So, I, and to try to pull on this like something new, Its like, okay, sure. Yeah, just, I dont want to promise more than Im going to be able to deliver. Ive, got other horses in the race And thats fine. Its not this race. \n\n\n\n3:56 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNope. And we know, yeah, we know business owners are busy, Lumina, Solar. We have a full operations team. We take care of the grant process for you. Theres not, theres not much on your end. You would need to do. I sent you an email but just, it would be some paperwork signing to get the grant application through. And then all the other details and requirements, Lumina will take care on their end. Most of thats going to be engineering requirements. Were going to have our operations team Look at the roof, the electrical, the structural, the building and make sure that this will qualify and be able to hold the weight of a solar system on the roof. Okay? \n\n\n\n4:35 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, I know that were looking currently at, we had a, I think it was like, in 2016, which is eight years ago, We had an entire foam roof put on the building and that was supposed to be like a 20, some odd year warranty. And of course, the company that installed it went out of business. So, weve had leaks since that time And we wanted to, you know, see what to do, Whats our next step? Our, we went and did the thing. You can see, its got this white and it looks kind of yellow now. But that white, the white, is the, elastomeric silicone, coating that goes on the top And, it, I think, what happened is, that, the, its a flat roof? God help me why they ever made a flat roof in the first place ever in the history of the universe. But, the, its, a flat roof. So it gets all these like puddles and I think that thats part of what the problem is that, you know, maybe its acid rain or whatever, But I think its just the promise of what that silicone is never came, you know, isnt true because were not getting the 20 years, Weve got some leaks. I dont know whether. So anyway, Im just letting you know that. \n\n\n\n6:10 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, youre having a roof issue. So, yeah, I mean, we. \n\n\n\n6:13 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, were looking at it, Yeah. When you said a new, you know, it could include the new roof because youre going to have the underlayments going to have to be dealt with. I dont know. Maybe thats what your engineering team comes up with. \n\n\n\n6:24 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYes. So that is a big issue that were seeing with these flat roofs is they, a lot of them are silicone coated instead of what you should have. What should be installed is an HD cover board on the roof with a TPL layer on top. Those will last 20 years. You have a 20 year warranty, but theyre much more durable over the lifetime of the system. And with these solar systems, thats whats required to be installed to put the solar up. Because of that pooling issue, You have these added weights to the rooftops. And if you dont have that HD cover board and that TPO, youre going to have that pooling and its going to cause leaks in the future. So. \n\n\n\n7:07 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, do they put that over top of whats already there? Is that, what a fix is Or is the fix just going on to the next building and saying, nope, this doesnt work? \n\n\n\n7:14 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNo, typically, well, put it on top. It does require a roofer to come on site. Theres scenarios where you do need to do a tear off, You tear off the existing roof down to the decking, and then you put your new HD cover board and TPO on top of that. Ideally, you would avoid the tear off because thats an extra cost to the project and we could just layer on top of the existing roof, But it completely, its completely adhered to the existing roof and seals it up so that you dont have that leak issue. \n\n\n\n7:47 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. And are these the things that are still even within this project? These are within the scope of what has to happen in order to get the solar? Or are those things that have to happen prior to getting the solar? I would cover those costs? \n\n\n\n8:01 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThey would happen in tangent. So what the grant would allow us to do is if we apply for this grant, on the project, youre, you would be able to get close to a few, 300,000 dollars in grant funds That those grant funds would cover the cost of the new roof so that youre not coming out of pocket. So were, for example, Im working with a project right now in Baltimore ASAP, compressors. We are using the grant funds to replace the roof and then hes locking into whats called, have you heard of a power purchase agreement before? \n\n\n\n8:37 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, but I think theyre all different. \n\n\n\n8:40 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYep. So, theres two ways to go about the solar project. You can buy the system yourself and take all the tax incentives or if you dont want to come out of pocket, any money, we can do this power purchase agreement. We would install the solar system for you at zero cost. You lock in a 20 year fixed electric rate with the solar. So that solar is providing the electric to the building at a fixed rate Thats lower than what youre paying BG E right now. And then, you would get savings every year because youre, paying lower electric rates, You have the solar producing the energy. And then because we have this grant on the table, wed, be able to apply for the grant funds and those grant funds would go to replace the roof. This is the scenario that works out where youre not coming out of pocket for the project. \n\n\n\n9:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo if I buy the system and I get the tax incentives, I have to, how does that work? \n\n\n\n9:36 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, we would quote the system. So lets, just what size is the system right now? So, lets say this is a half a 1,000,000 dollar project about You. Would you wouldnt finance or pay upfront, 500,000 dollars. You would get 30,000 back. Theres a 30 percent back for the federal tax credit. You would be able to do accelerated depreciation for the asset because its a renewable energy project. It would be covering the electric in the building. So thats an avoided cost for you in the future. Typically, we see the payback for a Maryland system right around the four year mark. So the system would pay itself off in four years. Additionally\u2026 we can still apply for the grant funds. Those grant funds can be applied for and be used to either pay down the system cost or will be used. You can use them for your roofing costs. In that scenario, yeah, you would have to fund the project yourself or through the company. And then you would get your fund, you would recoup your investment through, the grant, the tax credits and by not paying electric going forward. \n\n\n\n10:50 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. So the buying the system is the 500,000 dollar front cost, Get 30 percent back with the federal tax credit. \n\n\n\n11:06 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo thats like 100 dollars back there. \n\n\n\n11:14 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. And then I could avoid my electrical costs which are nominal, Id, get accelerated depreciation, which means that I would be able to accelerate it to one year first year or how accelerated instead of, I think a roof is going to be a 20 year depreciation schedule normally? \n\n\n\n11:29 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight. You can appreciate it. You can accelerate to five years and you get 40 percent bonus. So 40 percent of it can all be depreciated in year one and then 15 percent for the remaining four years. So thats your 100 percent. \n\n\n\n11:44 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIf we say 50 percent, you mean 60 percent over the fourth? \n\n\n\n11:48 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOh, yeah. Sorry, 40 percent in year one. Oh, I said 15, sorry, 15 percent each year after that\u2026 Which is six, yeah, which is your 60 percent? \n\n\n\n12:02 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nGot it. Okay. I was like what I thought you said 50, Im, like wait. \n\n\n\n12:05 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWait a minute, 15 for four years? \n\n\n\n12:09 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. And then you can still apply for the grant. So, if the grant were a 300,000 dollar grant and Ive gotten a cost 500,000, and I got my 50 tax credit. Now, Im, down to 350. So, if I got 300 on a grant, Id be only in for 50,000, but Id still be getting that. The rest of the, I get the 40 percent accelerated depreciation. \n\n\n\n12:38 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nExactly. But you would have to pay. \n\n\n\n12:41 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, Id actually be making money. \n\n\n\n12:43 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight. But youd have to figure out you got to use money to replace the roof though\u2026 Wed, have to figure out replacing the roof though. \n\n\n\n12:52 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThe 500,000 dollars is the money. That is right? The 500,000 up front is the replacement of the roof and the installation of the solar, correct? \n\n\n\n13:03 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNo, the 500,000 is for the solar cost, We would have to, we need to, we need to get a roofer on site and see what the cost of roof replacement would be. \n\n\n\n13:15 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAll right. Then if then I guess Im mixed up because if I went with, I thought we thought I thought you said before that it was like the 300,000 dollar, it was a 300,000 dollar solar thing and you would do the roof fixing if I went with the, \n\n\n\n13:30 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. My, so my recommendation, Right? So, I think that thats if you do a purchase option, I think that what weve been typically doing so that youre not paying any dollars out of pocket and you get a roof replacement and you get solar, you know, and the benefits is you do the power purchase agreement where a third party owns the system, you dont pay for the system. So zero, zero dollars up front, A company will pay the 500,000 dollars for the solar. You will then pay a cheaper electric rate going forward for the building thats locked and fixed in. So you still will pay for electric, itll just be at a lower rate than what youre\u2026 currently paying. Its typically between 30 to 35 percent lower than what youre currently paying over a 20 year period. That, what it does is it allows us to also apply for the grant. So you get then youre getting 300,000 dollars back to you through the grant. And you didnt pay anything up front for solar paying And that grant fund can go towards replacing the roof. So then you get a brand new roof that you didnt have to pay for through the grant. You get solar at zero cost. And then you just get a cheaper electric bill going forward. \n\n\n\n14:53 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI dont if the third party pays the 500,000 for the solar? \n\n\n\n14:59 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThen they keep that, you know, how they get their investment back is they get the, they get the tax credit, they get the depreciation and they, but the grant because youre, the site owner, the grant will go to you. \n\n\n\n15:17 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNo, but why would I be having to pay? I mean, if the whole thing is that theyre paying for it? And theres zero up front for me, why would I, if Im getting that 300,000, why would I have to pay for the roof? Because theyre already paying for it. Thats why Im mixed up? \n\n\n\n15:31 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThe third party will pay 500,000 dollars for the solar system, and we would apply for the grant and for 300,000 dollars. And that 300,000 dollars goes directly to you and can be paid used towards the roof costs. Theyre paying. \n\n\n\n15:51 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIn either case, Im, still having to pay for the roof cost. \n\n\n\n15:55 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, youre not, youre paying youre, just youre receiving grant funds to youre receiving a free roof because youre getting grant funds to pay for the roof. \n\n\n\n16:03 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nBut thats the case. In both cases, I either. \n\n\n\n16:07 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, yeah. In the second case, if you bought it, you would just have to, youd have to fund the 500,000 dollars. The grant. In that scenario, the grant money would come back to you and give you a new roof. So, youre, not paying out of pocket for a new roof, its coming from the grant funds, But the 500,000 dollars for the solar, you would have to finance yourself and you, because you financed it yourself, you would get the tax credit of 150,000, you would get the depreciation and you would avoid paying your electric cost going forward. \n\n\n\n16:47 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd this is, as the building owner, The building. Yeah, Not necessarily the tenant or the, this is not necessarily because this is a leased building. This building is leased to Tithe Corp. \n\n\n\n17:00 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nDo you, do you own Tithe? Corp? Yes, Right? So, yeah, the building owner would get the grant. \n\n\n\n17:12 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNot the, not the tenants, Thats correct? \n\n\n\n17:19 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI guess Im just not getting it because the, so, if I, \n\n\n\n17:22 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI want you to get it because its a really good project with the grant\u2026 Here, why dont you walk me through where your heads at? And then I can, we can backtrack a little bit. \n\n\n\n17:34 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, if I need to put a new roof on anyway, Right? Or I need to just fix the roof, I have, because, it, its likely that its not after eight years and its supposed to be a 20 year, roof, its likely that Ill probably have to just put more of the silicone on. Possibly they didnt that was one of the things that the people who came and looked at it said that maybe they just didnt put it on thick enough, Right? And that would be, and thats not going to stop the pooling. But even in the face of the pooling, if it were thicker, the pooling apparently expands it. And then it can, it goes through and, you know, theres a whole story to it, Right? Well. \n\n\n\n18:18 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. And so, what you would do is, when you? \n\n\n\n18:21 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWould get, It might not be able to be even supportive. I dont know how much those things weigh. \n\n\n\n18:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd so this would go and this would go through a full engineering and structural review, before we installed the project. \n\n\n\n18:37 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd then if there has to be, any like say, for instance, I get the roof done myself because Im going to have, it looks like Im going to have to do that, no matter what I know in both of these scenarios, I do that. \n\n\n\n18:49 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, I just want to be clear. You should, what you should do is you should use the grant funds to pay for the roof so that you dont have to pay for the roof. \n\n\n\n18:58 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, but itll be, it looks like its sounding like its a reimbursement thing. I have to have the roof done, and then I can apply the money that I got from the grant toward that. \n\n\n\n19:06 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. What will happen is we would apply for the grant. We get approval for the grant funds. Once the solar, the roof and the solar is completed, they will distribute the grant, the 300,000 to you. If you did the power purchase agreement, you wouldnt have to come out of pocket. Any dollars You would get solar, you would get a new roof installed\u2026 That would be financed through the power purchase agreement. You would get solar installed. After that is completed. The grant funds are distributed. The finance company is paying directly to the roofer, so that the finance company receives the 300,000 dollars because they financed the project up front from the grant. \n\n\n\n19:57 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. So youre, coordinating that aspect of it, Theres a finance company that they pay for the roof to be done, whatever you guys determine with your engineering. Yeah. \n\n\n\n20:09 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight. Once we have grant approval, then funds can start being distributed to the roofer and for the solar costs because we know the moneys coming back to the finance company. \n\n\n\n20:19 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd then when the grant actually comes through, I just basically sign up the back of the check to the finance company, and then Im getting a lower rate. \n\n\n\n20:32 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIve, elected former to? \n\n\n\n20:34 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOn my electric, Im, getting no rental income. Basically what Im getting out of it is a 30 percent reduction on my rate, Whatever the level of hassle is for doing the thing in the first place. But I get the, \n\n\n\n20:52 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nA roof paid for through a grant? Yeah. \n\n\n\n20:57 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight. But then its going to have somebody elses stuff on it. So, after the 20 years, is that those solar panels mine? \n\n\n\n21:04 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYes. So, theres two options After the 20 years, the system will be removed by the third party owner or you can extend for additional five years, You can extend, that lease term or that rate? \n\n\n\n21:20 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nDo they guarantee not to damage my roof? \n\n\n\n21:23 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYes, the system is insured and maintenance and O, M, operations and maintenance is taken care of for that 20 year period. So that, yeah, the roof? \n\n\n\n21:35 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, I dont actually end up owning it. All I can do is extend the, getting the 30 percent less cost. \n\n\n\n21:41 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd then theres a, there is a buyout clause. I dont know what the terms will be. But, at the end of the 20 years, therell be a buyout clause that you can say, hey, this systems worth 20,000 dollars in todays value and, you can buy it out if you want to. And then you just then after that, if you did buy it out after 20 years, Then you would get, You wouldnt be paying anything for electric from, because the solar system is providing all the electric for the building, You would just be responsible for the maintenance costs going forward after that, after its bought out Because during the 20 years period that maintenance is covered for you? \n\n\n\n22:24 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nActually, not for me, for the third party owner. \n\n\n\n22:32 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIm sorry, the maintenance. \n\n\n\n22:33 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThird party owners stuff. So any maintenance that would be responsible, you know, there would be needed, It would be their problem, not mine. \n\n\n\n22:40 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nCorrect. Yes. So youre buying electric from the solar at a cheaper rate. I mean, this comes up all the time. But hey, what if half the system isnt working for whatever reason? Lets just say theres a faulty electrical and half the system isnt producing. Youre only buying what power is being produced by the system. So if half the system is down, then youre only responsible for paying for half that power, You wouldnt be responsible for the full systems production if half of its down. \n\n\n\n23:20 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI dont know what that means. Why would I be responsible for anything? I mean, Im going to get if theres enough power, if 50 percent, Im, not using anywhere close to what? \n\n\n\n23:29 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. Do you know\u2026 Thats a very good question. Do you know how much electric you are using in the building? \n\n\n\n23:38 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI dont review the bills but its not anywhere. Its small. I dont know exactly, but I can find out, I guess. \n\n\n\n23:47 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, that would be good because thats going to determine we really, youre supposed to build or design these systems to cover no more than 100 percent of the current electric in the building. So we might need to make a smaller system thats just covering 100 percent, if this is producing too much. \n\n\n\n24:08 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. So, it would only the size of this then only becomes large. Enough. The size of the system is only large enough to cover 100 percent. And so, okay, its only large enough to cover 100 percent. Okay? \n\n\n\n24:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd heres an example, Lets just say youre really only using 100,000 kilowatt hours per year. Maybe your bills three or 4,000 dollars a month. Then we would just reduce the system size. The grand amount would reduce a little bit, but we can redo the calculation of how much the grand amount would be for. \n\n\n\n24:49 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. So, we would need then like, all right. So let me see if I can get it. \n\n\n\n24:55 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. So we would look at the electric bill and see how much youre consuming. \n\n\n\n24:59 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIf I go to BG E, can I get that off of there? Im, not sure if I can. \n\n\n\n25:03 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYou should be able to download a PDF and itll tell us the annual consumption in the building. \n\n\n\n25:20 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nHold on. Let me just if I can. \n\n\n\n25:33 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYep. Everythings kind of pegged to how much youre consuming Thatll determine the system size. And then that, if you can see this chart that determines the system size determines how much grant funds are distributed. \n\n\n\n25:45 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, our, like for instance, I can see that theres one here. The most recent one is July 20 ninth of 24 And the bill was only 911 dollars. Okay. So, lets see if it tells me how many KW that is. \n\n\n\n26:13 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. Its, its not, its like 4,740 KWH. Thats not a lot. \n\n\n\n26:25 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSounds right. Yeah. \n\n\n\n26:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI mean, thats that is the bill And thats what theyre basing it on? \n\n\n\n26:33 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd we would look at all 12 months. \n\n\n\n26:37 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight Now, if I had a January, let me just go and see, that was this year, July just a couple of months ago. So that was four seven four. Oh, And then if we were to look at something in January heres, January second, It was twice that amount, January, the previous January second. Mm, hmm, the amount. So youre, you know, with the heat and all? \n\n\n\n27:08 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\n9,700 KW? \n\n\n\n27:11 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYep. Okay. A little bit more. \n\n\n\n27:23 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, even if, you know, you just say somewhere between those two numbers, you know, say even 8,000 or something like that, but, and 12, 100,000 and what is it? What is the size of ours here? \n\n\n\n27:40 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, I just reduced it So you would, can you see here? \n\n\n\n27:45 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nI have to get back to where we are. Yeah, There we go. Okay\u2026 Considerably. \n\n\n\n27:51 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, its not a bad thing always. So this system, it reduces in size. This is producing 110,000 kilowatt hours for the year And were just using this as an example. So your system size reduces. So your grant funds, it does go down but its still cash or money that you can receive. And so its 1,700 per KW. So we take 1,700, We multiply it. This is the system size is an 81 point four five KW system. So multiply that 81 point four five. So you can receive 100 and\u2026 38,000 dollars from the grant funds. And what that you, what you can do is lets say you just shrink the size This system. It only goes on this roof surface. You have 138,000 dollars that you can use towards roof replacement And, that, you can use that money to replace this portion of the roof. Maybe theres some, maybe theres some extra money left over. Maybe this only cost you 100,000 dollars to replace. And you have 40,000, almost 40,000 dollars you can use to replace this roof. The money can you can use the money for how however you see fit The moneys going to you? \n\n\n\n29:17 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nExcept that if I go with the other thing, its not going. If I go with the no upfront cost, its going to the third party person who, put their money forward, and got, the loan. \n\n\n\n29:31 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, what would happen in that scenario? You would do the third party, You would get the third party. You would get solar at no cost. Still, you would still get a cheaper electric rate by 30 to 35 percent. And then that money would be distributed back to you. So you would get 138,000 dollar check. Youre still getting cheaper electric. And then you can decide how that 138,000 dollars is distributed. I mean, we would obviously need the roof in good condition. So we might want, youd probably use some of that money to, for roof replacements. But the rest of the money you can use how you see fit\u2026 Ill give you Ill, give you one example Heres heres a project were doing right now with the grant? \n\n\n\n30:20 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIm pulling it up for you. \n\n\n\n30:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, were doing mill center on 300 chestnut aft. \n\n\n\n30:35 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThey just replaced the roofs. So they dont need to use the grant money to replace the roofs. Now, theyre not a woman owned enterprise. So their grant funds are a little bit less than yours. Of course, the person for the system size. So this system size, this is going to cover, 56 percent of electric in the building. Theyre going to do the power purchase agreement. The system size is 289 KW. So they only get because theyre, Theyre not a woman in business. They apply for the bucket two funds, which is only a 1,000 dollars per KW, while you can receive 1,700 dollars per KW. So theyre going to get 289,000 dollars as a check back to them And they can use that. They dont need to use that money for the roofs. They can use it. Thats just going to go straight to the company. \n\n\n\n31:30 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nMm. Hmm. \n\n\n\n31:31 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd theyre not, you know, theyre receiving a 289,000 dollar check. Theyre not paying for the solar, And then they receive a cheaper electric bill. The other scenario is like you said, you can always buy it and receive the incentives, all the incentives yourself, If you have the tax appetite. \n\n\n\n31:52 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight. Well, I guess the next step is to find out whether or not the roof has to be replaced. Is that it, I think Or whether or not it can support the weight of these things? \n\n\n\n32:03 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYes. So, if we wanted to apply for the grant, the next steps would be, you would send over an electric bill. We would just make sure that we size the system accurately. So maybe the system needs to be a little bit bigger, maybe a little bit smaller. Wed, finalize how much grant funds you would receive. If all looks good for you. If you wanted to proceed with the project, we would get the document signed to apply for the grant, Make sure that we receive the grant funds. Thats a four to six week process with the Maryland Energy Authority. And once we have the grant funds secured, they say, hey, this is a, this is a project where we will award the funds. We will come on site, Well, have roof roofers, look at the roof. Wed, have a structural engineer, look at the structural because then we can start spending money towards development of the project. \n\n\n\n32:51 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. So, you dont know whether youre going to need to do anything more on the roof or not until after the four to six weeks and the acceptability of the grants is in place. \n\n\n\n33:01 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight? Because that gives us, yeah, that gives us notice to proceed. We have, we know, well, receive the grant funds and it was, we applied for it, It was approved and we can start doing the development work on the project. \n\n\n\n33:16 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. Do I need to decide before you make the grant? Whether Im going to go with the third party guy or whether Im going to go with owning it myself? \n\n\n\n33:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYes, because if I go here, it says click to apply Heres your grant process. So the first, well, the first question would be your women owned business. And so the second question is system ownership type. We would select for the application, direct ownership, You own the system or third party owned a solar lease or PPA power purchase agreement? \n\n\n\n33:53 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThe only acceptable TPO. \n\n\n\n33:58 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThird party owned? \n\n\n\n34:00 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. Are solar, PV leases or solar PV power purchase agreement. Okay? And thats what this one is, This is a solar, its an either or? \n\n\n\n34:14 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIts a, yeah, this would be a PV power purchase agreement. \n\n\n\n34:24 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nSo, the direct ownership one to go over it again. \n\n\n\n34:30 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, now, the just remember, we reduced the system size. So now its not a 500,000 dollar project anymore. \n\n\n\n34:36 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight. So, the direct ownership part because I dont owe any money on this building really? I mean, Ive got a tiny mortgage on it where, I could just go and use my equity in the building to put my new roof on with the solar and then own it and have it, Right? Because my understanding is if I have more solar than I use, I can basically reduce my bill by the fact that I am essentially selling it back to the system. \n\n\n\n35:10 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIt doesnt So when you overproduce power, say, we put panels all over the building. We overproduce any excess power you generated. You do get a credit back from BG E, but its only at the supply rate. So its only about seven to eight cents per kilowatt hour. What that means is, its not, Its not beneficial or its not economic. Theres no economic value to you to buy a bunch of extra panels and try to get eight cents back per kilowatt hour. It would, you would never get your money back. The, the best or economic the best economical systems cover, right? About 100 percent of all your power, so that youre, not paying for power from the utility company anymore, Its generated on the roof but its not in your benefit to try to sell power to the grid Because of how low theyre paying of how low of a cent, theyre going to pay you back? \n\n\n\n36:07 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, Im, currently, thats kind of weird because if Im only going to get seven seven cents, lets say, if Im only paying instead of my bill, Im only paying 10, why wouldnt I want 70, thats 70 percent of all my extra? Because if its all extra and I get nothing, Im, not saying that I want to do anything bigger. Im, not saying that. Im, just all Im saying is that. \n\n\n\n36:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. Let me Ill try to explain it another way. If you design this system like as is this will cover, right? About 100 percent of all your power, Thats what you want. Youre not going to pay. Now, youre not going to pay money to the utility company going forward because you put solar up there, Not on your benefit to design a system with like 20 extra panels because youre going to have to buy 20 extra panels and anything those 20 extra panels produce, thatll go to the grid, Youll get a credit back for that, but its going to be for a very small amount. What Im saying is its not worth paying a bunch of money up front for these extra panels to try to get or recoup money or credits back from the utility company over time because of how little the utility company is paying you back. \n\n\n\n37:09 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nExactly. Okay. Its. \n\n\n\n37:12 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. So you want to stick to keeping it right around 100 percent? \n\n\n\n37:25 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd we can run both scenarios. We can say, hey, you know, this is the total cost of the system based on your electric bill. This is how much? \n\n\n\n37:32 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWhy does the grant program need to know which it is beforehand? I dont understand that part. Why would they need to know? \n\n\n\n37:42 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThats a good question. The funds are distributed to whoever owns the system. And so, in direct ownership scenario, I didnt mean to do that. Sorry, In direct ownership scenario, we would apply under your name. The funds go directly to you. In a third party ownership scenario, we would apply under the third partys name, The funds? \n\n\n\n38:07 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWhich is Lumina, Is that who youd apply for under Lumina? \n\n\n\n38:11 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nActually, theres three parties involved. Theres you, who owns the building, Theres Lumina, Im, the installer. So, were the solar installers? \n\n\n\n38:21 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n38:21 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThe third party owner, theyre going to upfront the money. Its like a bank, Theyre going to upfront the money Like building a house, were the construction Were going to come and build it And were going to get paid by the third party to do it. \n\n\n\n38:35 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. And who actually does the buying of the, and the supplying of, is that you, You buy and supply the panels themselves as well as install them? \n\n\n\n38:46 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nCorrect. Yeah. Were doing everything in house. The third party owner, whos the bank fronting the money for the project? Thats Down East Renewables, And thats the name of the, \n\n\n\n39:00 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nthe bank, Down East Renewables. Okay. Yeah. And so youre, the installer and supplier of the panels\u2026 Correct? And then, who is the, who is the owner of it? It says the third party owner is the bank. But once the bank is paid back, how is, how are they the owner? \n\n\n\n39:21 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThe, the third party owner is Down East Renewables. And then that scenario, if you use a third party ownership, theyre going to install the panels on your roof. And then, youre, slowly paying. Its like almost its not a loan because theres no lien on the property, but youre slowly, youre paying a cheaper electric bill going forward. Youre, paying Down East Renewables for the electric from the solar panels at a cheaper rate than what you would pay BG. E. So Down East, you would be paying Down East, going for electric at a cheaper rate. \n\n\n\n39:54 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. And so I would pay Id, pay them for my electric. Okay? And so they, theyre, not really a bank. They are, they have their own banking relationship if they have one, Correct? And so theyre, the third party, They own it, they maintain it, you install it, you supply the panels And Im, supplying the roof for the, or, the space for them to do this. And I, and as a, I get paid essentially with a discount off of what Im currently paying for my electric. \n\n\n\n40:35 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nExactly. You got it A little complicated? \n\n\n\n40:40 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. I need to run the numbers because I would, I could use the credits and the depreciation and all of that. So, I have more than this property and I, and it gets combined on my, your taxes Schedule E. And so it gets more involved. I also have another building in Frederick. Do you work in Frederick? \n\n\n\n41:08 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWe do, We work in all of Maryland? \n\n\n\n41:10 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIts a, lets pull it up An apartment building? \n\n\n\n41:17 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. All depends on how much roof space we have to work with. \n\n\n\n41:20 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIts a lot and its in the sun. \n\n\n\n41:23 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nDo you pay? Is it master metered? Or are there, is it all individual metered? \n\n\n\n41:29 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIts individual metered at this point? \n\n\n\n41:32 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, that, so thats what makes some of these project complicated because. \n\n\n\n41:36 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nWell, I would like to find out because one of the things that Im looking at just to complicate everything even further, Phil, is that, Im looking at kind of minimizing that property. Each one of those things have their own meter right now. But if I kind of minimize and I have solar panels, Yes, I have the ability of having an additional sales feature that the condominium owns the solar panel situation and all of the owners end up with possibly even no cost. \n\n\n\n42:09 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nRight? Or cheaper electric. Yep, Or cheaper. Yeah, usually, yeah, clean energy, You can, I mean, you can do a few scenarios there. You can install it and sell power back to the tenants at a lower rate. What is the address? \n\n\n\n42:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nFour, one, two B, like boy, West South Street, Theres two buildings that both are four, one, two West South Street, One of thems B, its a larger apartment building, Its 24 units in the back. \n\n\n\n42:46 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAm I looking the right place? \n\n\n\n42:50 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. There it is, Its right in the middle of the bottom there, Thats it right there, This place, Yep. \n\n\n\n42:59 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. I mean, we can absolutely take a look at this. Its much easier and simpler if everythings a one meter because youre tying that solar system to one meter. And if you have to break it down to all these meters, it really makes it a complicated project. So we do try to avoid those, But, we can entertain it, See how far we can get. We would take it. Yeah, you would just send over electric bills and we would take a look of how big of a system we would need. \n\n\n\n43:32 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. And your program will take a look at the orientation of the building and how old? Is that just Google Maps? And it gives a date of when it is. \n\n\n\n43:41 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nHeres a better one. This is a, its Google Maps, But we actually, we upgrade to near maps, Its, its newer satellite imagery So that we can its really so we can see if theres anything changed to the roof over time, We use a heat map. This is called the irradiance report. It shows us where youre getting the best sun exposure on the roof. So we want to avoid areas that are red, like the back or north facing roofs And like around like this vent area, you can see its red and purple there. So you have less sun exposure. \n\n\n\n44:14 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThat means where its getting shade? \n\n\n\n44:16 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, thats where its getting shade. So you really want to see areas that are bright orange and yellow. Thats where the panels, we want to concentrate panels. And we use a kind of lidar detection, but its light imagery, It shows us the height in, of all the trees surrounding your building. And it shows us the pitches or topography of the land. So we can see the pictures of the roof. So we did the same amazing. Yeah. So with do the same thing with your project here. Its just taking a little load. And what is that called? This is called lidar, LIDAR, It stands for Light Imagery Detection and Ranging. So its actually in all autonomous cars right now. So every Tesla has lidar, It shoots it out and tells you if youre going to approach a car in front of you. So it slows you down. And then the color code, this is, look how yellow your roof is. Its excellent. But its called a radiance. So this tells us how much sun exposure that this roof surface is getting, Its really yellow. So its a hot roof surface. Its really perfect for solar. And then we just want to avoid any areas that have trees surrounding it to avoid the shade. \n\n\n\n45:33 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd so when you, are, you, is this the lidar one right now? Where would, because it showed those, all the trees, funny shapes in the last one you showed? \n\n\n\n45:41 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. There you go. Yeah. So, those trees there, they, theyre not that tall, but yeah, we would build them up. Youd probably avoid putting panels towards the right side of that roof just to avoid shade. The, the left side of that roof opened up so you wouldnt have any, you wouldnt have any shading effect, which is good. This back roof is better. Its higher up, Its not, theres no trees. So if youre going to do a system, thats why I kept the panels there. You definitely want to. \n\n\n\n46:13 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nMm. Hmm. \n\n\n\n46:14 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nIts just a better location. Ultimately, the goal is to use the least amount of panels possible because elite, the less panels we use, the more production, the better pricing you get because, youre, buying the smallest possible to cover 100 percent. \n\n\n\n46:31 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. Well, let me run the numbers to see about whether I should go with doing it myself or whether I could go with a third party. \n\n\n\n46:45 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYep. Both get you the grant application, which is good. As soon as the one thing Ill say these funds arent forever, Theyve already been 50 58 point five percent applied for current funding. So we dont have a limited timing. We do expect this to be 100 percent by the end of the year. \n\n\n\n47:07 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd this is for next year. \n\n\n\n47:10 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThis is for, yeah, for 20 25 funds. Okay. What I think next steps should be, if you send a copy of the electric bill, Ill, design the system to match 100 percent of the electric in the building, Then we can see what the total cost is to build that system. Ill get you, that price and you can run the numbers based on that price. And that will tell us also how much grant funds you would, you can apply for? \n\n\n\n47:38 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah. What Im going to try to do is get because the KW is the KW, is the KW as opposed to the dollars And, were bringing people back into our office Since COVID, we have literally, that 14,000 square foot that you see right there, Thats got the roof, that second story Thats nobodys even in there. They have. I mean, its literally, you know, empty, Not empty, Every, its like a old, its like a movie You go in there. And like as everybody just walked out and never came back every year, Its just crazy. And so were planning to get back into our offices. So that, I want to go and look at those previous bills to see like when we actually had somebody up there, We had air conditioning on and we had lights on and we did these, you know, we had a real business there, Right? Because right now, everybodys remote, If we pull them back in there, I dont want to size this too small And then were like shucks. You know, what happens then? \n\n\n\n48:32 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThats a fair, thats a very fair point. And so, you know, PG E does have a limit, but based on your current electric bills, you can size a system to 200 percent capacity. So we can essentially, we can double the system size to what your current electric bill is. You cant go past that. \n\n\n\n48:52 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. So Im going to just check, the old bills just to see. \n\n\n\n48:58 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, you can, I mean we do this, we do that all the time. We oversize the system a little bit because we know electric is going to increase in the future. \n\n\n\n49:06 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. Terrific. Well, I will, I think that, for the time being, we should probably look at doing this based on me buying it. Mm. Hmm. And, and so, you could start that with me buying it because I am, you know, in addition to everything else, this loan on the building is coming is being refinanced before the middle of the year. So this is a perfect. If there were going to be ever perfect timing for this all to occur. Its, right now. Okay? \n\n\n\n49:44 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd, were completely fine with that. The just, yeah, just send me a copy of the electric bill so I can size the system appropriately, and then that will allow me to get you current pricing. \n\n\n\n49:55 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay. All right. \n\n\n\n50:00 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nAnd were going to try to make this the least complicated, least time consuming for you. So as soon as we know pricing, if all looks well, we will apply, well, we can get the grant application out the door. Okay? \n\n\n\n50:11 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nNow, do you have another company that you work with? I know youre working with this third party and they have their own financing. Do you have another one for people go direct and are buying outright, that you work with? Thats a finance company that does that? \n\n\n\n50:24 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYes, Its called Sunstone. And we have, theyre, a financing provider strictly for solar loans or only for solar loans And, we can look at what rates they have on the market right now. \n\n\n\n50:37 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nOkay\u2026 Perfect. If I can go in, with something with my, to my bank and say, well, heres whats offered already that I can get from Sunstone, Right? Yeah, Theres, you know, because otherwise, you just, theyre, bankers, Thats what they do? \n\n\n\n50:54 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, I know. Yeah, I have a portal with Sunstone. I just plug in the price and, theyll tell me what the current interest rates are. \n\n\n\n51:02 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nPerfect. Okay. So Ill, get those bills for you. Ill, also try to get the older ones so that we can actually see what percentage we want to deal with And hopefully well be able to get that by tomorrow, so we can move ahead with this. \n\n\n\n51:17 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nYeah, I think, yeah, the sooner we get the application in, the sooner, well know how much funds youll get. So Perfect. Then we can make decisions based on that. \n\n\n\n51:27 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThank you, Phil. Appreciate your time. \n\n\n\n51:29 | Lisa H. Ambrose\n\nThanks, Lisa. Thank you. Sounds good. Have a good day. Bye bye. Thank you.",

            "Here\u2019s a detailed comparison of Phil\u2019s call against the Discovery Call Template (MEDPICC framework), highlighting where he succeeded, where there\u2019s room for improvement, and overall adherence to the structure.\n\n### 1. **Introduction**\n   - **Greeting and Rapport**: Phil initiated a friendly greeting, and he quickly transitioned to discussing the client\u2019s roofing and energy needs, which helped him build rapport early on.\n   - **Introduction to Lumina Solar**: Phil briefly introduced himself and Lumina Solar\u2019s capabilities but didn\u2019t fully describe the agenda or purpose of the call, which would have added structure.\n   - **Purpose and Agenda**: He lacked a formal agenda, which made the conversation somewhat circuitous and occasionally confusing for the client. A clearer agenda might have helped focus on specific goals more efficiently.\n\n### 2. **Rapport Building**\n   - **Personal Connection**: Phil established a connection by understanding the client\u2019s roof concerns and showing interest in their situation, which helped build trust. He also acknowledged the challenges of flat roofs and offered insights into roofing solutions.\n   - **Business-Specific Questions**: While he briefly touched on Tithe Corp.\u2019s goals, he could have added more questions about their energy strategy and future growth to strengthen the business connection.\n\n### 3. **Exploration and Discovery (MEDPICC Framework)**\n   - **Metrics (M)**: Phil focused on metrics related to grant funding, tax incentives, and overall project costs, which aligned with understanding the financial metrics important to the client. However, he could have probed more about specific financial goals, like long-term cost savings targets or energy usage optimization.\n   - **Economic Buyer (E)**: Phil clarified that Lisa was a key decision-maker but could have gone further in exploring her priorities, expectations, and the influence of other decision-makers. This would have helped tailor his pitch to align more with her specific needs.\n   - **Decision Criteria (D)**: He addressed decision criteria, particularly by discussing roofing options, project costs, and the power purchase agreement (PPA) structure. However, Phil missed asking for additional criteria the client might be using to compare providers, which could clarify Tithe Corp.\u2019s specific preferences.\n   - **Decision Process (D)**: Phil briefly touched on the grant application process but could have explored the organization\u2019s overall timeline for decision-making and any milestones they had. A deeper dive into how decisions are finalized, especially with multiple options on the table, would clarify the approval process.\n   - **Paper Process (P)**: Phil mentioned Lumina\u2019s turnkey handling of permits and processes, showing he understood the logistical aspects. However, he could have asked if Tithe Corp. had specific contractual requirements or if they had any concerns about contracts, financing, or ownership.\n   - **Identify Pain (I)**: Phil identified the client\u2019s issues with their roof and potential costs associated with roof repairs. However, he could have asked additional questions to clarify how these roofing and energy challenges affected their overall business.\n   - **Champion (C)**: Phil didn\u2019t specifically identify a champion in Tithe Corp. who might advocate for the solar project. Asking about any internal supporters could help him gauge the level of internal enthusiasm and support for the project.\n   - **Competition (C)**: Phil didn\u2019t ask if the client was evaluating other providers, which could have offered insight into competitors and helped differentiate Lumina\u2019s services.\n\n### 4. **Suitability and Financial Considerations**\n   - **Site Suitability**: Phil asked relevant questions about roof condition, coating, and structural stability, aligning well with site suitability considerations. He also offered solutions for potential roofing upgrades and explained the roof assessment process effectively.\n   - **Investment Model**: Phil provided a detailed explanation of ownership vs. PPA options, covering tax incentives and depreciation benefits. This aspect aligned with the template\u2019s recommendation to discuss financing options and was particularly helpful for the client\u2019s nonprofit structure.\n\n### 5. **Next Steps and Confirmation**\n   - **Recap Key Insights**: Phil didn\u2019t provide a concise summary of key points discussed. A summary could have helped reinforce the discussion and made next steps clearer for the client.\n   - **Propose Next Steps**: He effectively outlined next steps, including obtaining electricity bills and running calculations. However, his proposal could have been more organized by explicitly suggesting follow-up meetings and confirming timelines.\n   - **Confirm Timeline**: Although he discussed some next steps, Phil missed locking in a specific timeline or date for follow-up, which could have created a more concrete plan for moving forward.\n\n### 6. **Closing**\n   - **Thank You and Enthusiasm**: Phil ended the call by expressing his appreciation, though he missed a final statement about Lumina\u2019s commitment to helping the client. A brief reiteration of their dedication could have reinforced Lumina Solar\u2019s value.\n   - **Reiterate Commitment**: Although Phil didn\u2019t explicitly state Lumina\u2019s commitment to the client\u2019s goals, his detailed explanation of the grant process and funding options implied it. However, a more direct statement would have solidified Lumina\u2019s commitment to seeing the project through.\n\n### **Summary**\n- **What Phil Did Well**: He built rapport through detailed discussions on roofing and provided a comprehensive overview of the PPA vs. ownership options, making complex financial scenarios clear for the client. His flexibility in offering multiple solutions demonstrated adaptability to the client\u2019s needs.\n- **Areas for Improvement**: Phil could improve by setting a clear agenda, summarizing main points, and exploring additional discovery questions around decision criteria, economic priorities, and competitive alternatives. Following the MEDPICC structure more closely would likely clarify the discovery process and uncover deeper insights into the client\u2019s motivations and constraints."

However, he partially covered several key MEDPICC elements like metrics, decision criteria, and the decision process. He also missed components like competitive alternatives and identifying a champion, and he did not recap key points.\n\n- **Mark**: Mark also excelled in rapport building, suitability, and the investment model but missed deeper discovery questions around metrics, decision criteria, and the decision-making process. Like Shane, he did not identify a champion or competitive landscape and did not provide a clear recap or structured agenda.\n\n- **Phil**: Phil provided strong explanations on rapport building, suitability, and the investment model but lacked structure in agenda setting and did not address all MEDPICC elements. Key gaps included metrics, decision criteria, and a structured next steps plan. He also missed competitive questions and did not identify any internal advocates.\n\nIn all cases, following the template fully would have ensured a more structured and comprehensive discovery process."

            "Here\u2019s a breakdown of where each rep excelled in their discovery calls:\n\n### **1. Shane**\n   - **Rapport Building**: Shane effectively established rapport with his client by engaging them on a personal level and showing genuine interest in their organization\u2019s goals and challenges. This helped to build trust and create a collaborative atmosphere for the conversation.\n   - **Suitability**: Shane excelled in discussing site suitability, particularly in explaining the roof condition, shading concerns, and other factors that could affect the solar installation. His use of visuals, like the 3D model, helped the client better understand the project\u2019s practical aspects.\n   - **Investment Model**: He did a thorough job of explaining the different financing options (such as ownership vs. Power Purchase Agreement), covering the benefits and potential downsides of each. This aligned well with his nonprofit client\u2019s cash constraints, showing he tailored his approach to their financial structure.\n\n### **2. Mark**\n   - **Rapport Building**: Mark\u2019s strength was in creating a friendly, engaging call where he made personal connections by sharing relevant anecdotes. This helped ease the client into the conversation and build trust.\n   - **Suitability**: Mark thoroughly covered the technical and logistical aspects of the project, such as roof condition and meter location, which helped the client understand site-specific factors and potential challenges.\n   - **Investment Model**: He offered a clear comparison of ownership vs. third-party financing options, helping the client understand their options and how each would impact cash flow, tax incentives, and other financial aspects. This was particularly helpful for a client considering long-term savings and financial viability.\n\n### **3. Phil**\n   - **Rapport Building**: Phil established a strong initial connection by showing empathy for the client\u2019s roof issues and validating their concerns, which fostered a sense of trust and understanding.\n   - **Detailed Explanations of Financial Options**: Phil provided a comprehensive overview of different ownership structures and their tax implications, covering federal tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and grant availability. His detailed explanations were especially valuable to the client, who needed clarity on financing options and tax advantages.\n   - **Grant Funding Knowledge**: Phil demonstrated expertise in Maryland\u2019s commercial solar grant program, explaining in depth how the grant could help with roof replacement and other costs. His familiarity with these specific grants was a unique strength that added significant value to the conversation.\n\nEach rep showed strengths in areas that aligned well with their clients\u2019 needs, whether it was rapport-building, technical suitability, or financial structuring. Following a structured format, however, would have complemented these strengths and made each call even more effective."

            "To gauge experience more accurately, here are a few indicators to look for in the calls that might suggest greater tenure or familiarity with solar sales:\n\n### 1. **Technical Knowledge and Ease with Industry Jargon**\n   - **Phil** used detailed terminology, especially around grants, tax incentives, and roof types (HD cover board, TPO layer, etc.), which suggests a deep familiarity with commercial solar specifics. He seemed comfortable with advanced topics that are typically encountered after several years in the industry.\n   - **Shane** also demonstrated strong technical knowledge, particularly when discussing site suitability. His comfort with visual aids like 3D models and his focus on nonprofit cash constraints could indicate substantial experience but may also reflect tailored knowledge specific to his client.\n   - **Mark** was clear in explaining ownership vs. third-party financing options but didn\u2019t delve as deeply into technical aspects, which might indicate a focus on less complex or newer solar markets.\n\n### 2. **Confidence with Complex Financial Structures**\n   - **Phil** excelled in explaining tax benefits, accelerated depreciation, and detailed grant funding scenarios, which often requires experience working with multiple types of clients, especially those needing financial structuring in commercial solar. His ability to customize financing scenarios suggests advanced knowledge that usually builds over time.\n   - **Shane** was adept at nonprofit financing solutions but didn't explore other complex financial structures. His comfort in this area suggests he may be seasoned but potentially more specialized in certain client types.\n   - **Mark** explained the financial options clearly but didn't venture into complex scenarios, indicating possible familiarity with simpler financing models, perhaps in residential or smaller commercial deals.\n\n### 3. **Handling Client Objections and Concerns**\n   - **Phil** was thorough in addressing potential client concerns around roof repairs, PPA ownership, and long-term project benefits, showing a proactive approach to common solar objections. This level of foresight is often seen in experienced sellers who anticipate questions before they arise.\n   - **Shane** did well in explaining the suitability of the project for the client but didn\u2019t anticipate as many financial or logistical concerns as Phil did. This may suggest less experience in situations where financial objections are frequent.\n   - **Mark** handled client questions effectively but didn\u2019t go as in-depth with pre-emptive solutions, which can sometimes indicate a less extensive tenure.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBased on these indicators:\n   - **Phil** seems the most likely to have the longest tenure in solar sales, especially in commercial projects requiring advanced financial structuring and technical knowledge.\n   - **Shane** likely has substantial experience as well, perhaps in a more specialized or client-focused area like nonprofit or mission-driven clients.\n   - **Mark** may have slightly less experience in complex solar sales, potentially focusing more on straightforward financing structures, which is often seen in earlier career stages or simpler solar markets. \n\nOverall, Phil\u2019s depth in grant funding, financial structuring, and pre-emptive client concern handling suggest he has been in solar sales the longest."

Pre-Call Preparation (Optional but Recommended)**\n   - **Research Client's Business and Priorities**: Identify any relevant grants, incentives, or specific needs, especially for nonprofits or specialized industries.\n   - **Prepare Financial and Suitability Visuals**: Have a model or heat map ready for on-the-spot site assessment. \n   - **Know Available Financing Options**: Be ready with details for ownership, PPAs, tax incentives, and any specific grant programs.\n\n#### **2. Introduction (3-5 Minutes)**\n   - **Set the Stage**: Briefly introduce yourself, your role, and Lumina Solar's capabilities.\n   - **Agenda and Purpose**: Clearly outline the call\u2019s purpose, explaining that you\u2019ll be covering suitability, financial options, and any grant programs, and invite the client to ask questions anytime.\n\n#### **3. Rapport Building (5-10 Minutes)**\n   - **Establish Common Ground**: Engage personally by asking about their business\u2019s background or a specific detail (e.g., location, previous energy solutions).\n   - **Highlight Relevant Experience**: Briefly mention any similar projects you\u2019ve handled that align with their industry or energy goals.\n   - **Acknowledge Time Constraints**: Validate their busy schedule and emphasize that Lumina will handle most logistics, minimizing their involvement.\n\n#### **4. Exploration and Discovery (15-20 Minutes)**\n   - **Metrics (M)**: Uncover their cost-saving goals, electricity usage, and any operational efficiencies they hope to achieve.\n   - **Economic Buyer (E)**: Identify all decision-makers, especially for nonprofits or commercial clients, and understand any specific expectations they have (e.g., ROI, grant dependency).\n   - **Decision Criteria (D)**: Ask what criteria they\u2019re using to evaluate solar providers and how Lumina can meet or exceed these benchmarks.\n   - **Decision Process (D)**: Understand their approval process, expected timelines, and any stakeholders involved at each stage.\n   - **Identify Pain Points (I)**: Probe into energy cost challenges, budget restrictions, and site limitations. Highlight the impact if these aren\u2019t addressed, which may create urgency.\n\n#### **5. Financial and Site Suitability Assessment (10-15 Minutes)**\n   - **Site Suitability**: Review the roof, meter locations, and surrounding obstructions using visual aids (e.g., 3D models, heat maps).\n   - **Investment Model**: Provide options for ownership, PPA, or leasing based on their financial profile. Discuss benefits, tax incentives, and grants for each model.\n   - **Address Roof Concerns**: Clarify if roof upgrades are needed and how costs can be minimized through grants or financing options.\n\n#### **6. Overcoming Objections (As Needed)**\n   - **Clarify Complex Financing Options**: Address any confusion about PPAs, ownership, tax incentives, and grants. Summarize these clearly, comparing costs, benefits, and timelines.\n   - **Explain Third-Party Ownership and Grant Funding**: For clients concerned about third-party ownership, explain benefits, maintenance, and long-term options (e.g., buyout or extension).\n   - **Anticipate Common Objections**: Prepare responses to questions on roof integrity, maintenance, and grant disbursements to ensure transparency.\n\n#### **7. Summarize and Confirm Key Insights (3-5 Minutes)**\n   - **Recap Major Points**: Briefly summarize key takeaways from the conversation, including suitability, financial options, grant eligibility, and any specific client preferences or criteria.\n   - **Validate Understanding**: Check in with the client to confirm that they understand the next steps and how the discussed options meet their needs.\n\n#### **8. Next Steps and Timeline (5 Minutes)**\n   - **Outline Immediate Actions**: For example, gathering energy bills, sending a site survey team, or preparing a grant application.\n   - **Set a Follow-Up Date**: Propose a specific date for the next meeting to discuss final proposals or grant updates.\n\n#### **9. Closing Remarks (2-3 Minutes)**\n   - **Thank the Client**: Express appreciation for their time and interest, reiterating Lumina\u2019s commitment to making the process as efficient and beneficial as possible.\n   - **Reinforce Value and Dedication**: Close by emphasizing Lumina Solar\u2019s dedication to optimizing their energy savings, handling logistics, and securing grants.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Tips for Reps**\n   - **Visualize Financial Benefits**: Use examples of savings from similar clients or highlight recent successful grant-funded projects to build credibility.\n   - **Customize Discussion Points**: Adjust questions based on the client\u2019s industry, location, and energy priorities to show you understand their specific needs.\n   - **Be Proactive in Addressing Common Concerns**: Anticipate and respond to questions on roof suitability, financing options, and contract terms.\n\n---\n\nThis refined framework provides a structured, client-focused approach while emphasizing rapport, tailored financial insights, and proactive support for complex questions. Each section is designed to keep the conversation focused, informative, and aligned with Lumina\u2019s value proposition."

How you doing this morning? \n\n\n\n0:25 | Patrick\n\nIm, Walt. Thank you. How are you? \n\n\n\n0:27 | Colin\n\nHey, not too bad. \n\n\n\n0:31 | Colin\n\nDoes now still work for you? \n\n\n\n0:34 | Patrick\n\nDoes who? \n\n\n\n0:35 | Colin\n\nI said, does now, theres now still a good time for you? \n\n\n\n0:38 | Patrick\n\nOh, yeah. Thats fine. Im, on the way to the office? \n\n\n\n0:41 | Colin\n\nOh, nice. Okay. So, yeah, I just wanted to hop on. I know. So you had spoke with Mark Harbald, you said? \n\n\n\n0:48 | Patrick\n\nWe did, Mark, done some consulting work for us on some new rules over the last couple of years and said he had previously been involved in a solar business and he knew you guys and said youd be good people to talk to. \n\n\n\n1:05 | Colin\n\nYeah. Well, I appreciate that. So, you had recently done roof work on your building or just various stages of roof work over the year? Okay, nice. \n\n\n\n1:11 | Patrick\n\nWe have. \n\n\n\n1:14 | Patrick\n\nWe recently replaced most of the, all the roofs in the big building. \n\n\n\n1:20 | Colin\n\nGot it. Well, cool. Well, yeah, were familiar with that area. We just did a project for Klein Enterprises on one of the new facilities there right up the street right across from Union Craft on the other side of the highway. So, Im familiar with that area. \n\n\n\n1:37 | Patrick\n\nThats the self storage facility? \n\n\n\n1:41 | Colin\n\nYeah, we just did a project on that with them. I think it just got turned on probably a month ago. Oh, did they really, Klein did? \n\n\n\n1:46 | Patrick\n\nThey bought that land from us? Yeah. \n\n\n\n1:54 | Patrick\n\nWell, they actually made it. \n\n\n\n1:58 | Colin\n\nOr it was probably a joint venture, but, yeah. \n\n\n\n2:00 | Patrick\n\nYeah, they bought it from CSG Partners, who was the contract buyer that they assigned to decline. Yeah, we did a redevelopment in that area several years ago, and they were the last buyer in there, to do anything. Yeah. So, yeah, we. \n\n\n\n2:07 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n2:18 | Colin\n\nGot it. Yeah, we do a lot of stuff with Klein and I dont know if, you know, Matt Allen or Aaron Levinoff at all, but, yeah, we do a lot of stuff with those guys. \n\n\n\n2:28 | Patrick\n\nGo\u2026 Good. \n\n\n\n2:30 | Colin\n\nSo, yeah. So, what I mean, what do you know about solar? What, you know, there you go? \n\n\n\n2:35 | Patrick\n\nActually, I dont know anything. I got a, I got a, I responded to an ad, I think that I got in a newsletter that I get every day for a group in New Jersey called Solar Landscaping. And I responded to the ad and, theyre putting some information together. And then I called and talked to Mark about it and he recommended that I talk to you guys. I was kind of intrigued by the concept that, they suggested that you, they would basically lease the roof from you. So its like another tenant And, and I dont know if thats the right way to go or its the only way to go. I just, I mean, this is, very, Let me hear it. \n\n\n\n2:48 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n3:02 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n3:14 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n3:27 | Colin\n\nYeah. Well, I can give you the quick kind of crash course to at least give you some context. So, yeah, so Ill, just start, I mean, Im, one of the owners of Lumina, Im, the Chief Revenue Officer. So, I oversee all of our business development efforts. And, you know, were right, were located just south of the city, right? In Arbutus, Have about a, have about 160 employees. So we were really a construction, I mean, were a construction company, But we help with project development as well. So, you know, if you look at, I mean, you know, youre, a developer, right? I mean, is that how youd classify yourself as a developer? \n\n\n\n3:31 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n3:48 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n3:53 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n4:04 | Patrick\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n4:06 | Patrick\n\nYeah, thats what we do. Yep. \n\n\n\n4:06 | Colin\n\nYep. So, you know, not all different than, you know, commercial real estate. I mean, right? If you were building a building, you might have think of a parties involved Youd have like a financier like finance. \n\n\n\n4:20 | Colin\n\nYoud have a developer, youd probably have, youd have a general contractor and then youd have all the labor subs, right? Like that would be the typical like kind of four buckets and making a project happen. So, for a solar project, its actually fairly the same. You typically have a financier thats going to be the long term asset owner. You have a solar developer whos working to kind of, You know, find the deal, piece together the GC and the financing, etc, You have a general contractor to build it. And then you have, you know, labor subs, various stages, whatever. So, those are sort of the same four circles. So where we kind of fall into that is, we have all the labor. So we dont sub any labor Were a general contractor. So we can, we essentially can build the whole thing with all our labor, etc. And then, we are like 50 50 in the developer space. So we can, I can have conversations like this and help develop the projects. We have multiple financing avenues and partners we work with. We are not a financer Were not an asset owner. \n\n\n\n4:23 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n4:29 | Patrick\n\nYep. All of it. \n\n\n\n4:35 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n4:43 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n4:58 | Patrick\n\nSure. \n\n\n\n5:14 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n5:29 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n5:30 | Colin\n\nSo, some solar developers like Solar Landscape is a solar developer. Theyre theyre developing projects. They have a long term asset owner, and then they find They can general contract to some extent. But then they sub the labor out. Like we would be someone who they would potentially sub the labor to. So like they dont do, they dont have boots on the ground, right? They might, they might GC some of it. So we come at it, where were boots on the ground? Were the full GC, we can help develop it. And then we go to the market and help find a financier thats a long term asset owner based on the nature of the deal were trying to structure. \n\n\n\n5:36 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n5:52 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n5:59 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n6:10 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n6:11 | Colin\n\nSo, its important to kind of know that distinction. Most conversations that entities have are similar like what you described. They had a, and got something in the mail or someone reached out to them from a developer, Our biggest thing when we talk to clients is like understanding making sure you understand who the party is in all four circles at the time you sign the contract. So knowing who the financier is, whos the developer, whos the general contractor, basically, whos doing all the work. So theres no surprises. \n\n\n\n6:42 | Patrick\n\nWait, What? \n\n\n\n6:43 | Colin\n\nBut its just important to know because sometimes weve been in scenarios where people are trying to compare things and theyre talking to a financer, an asset owner, and then theyre talking to us, whos like the GC Were all trying to put together the same deal. Its just, it can\u2026 the nature of the conversation is a little different depending on what party youre talking to. So, I just wanted to make that aware. So, the second thing is, to your point is how its actually interconnected to the building, right? So, when we build a solar project, I mean, its largely the same depending on how you interconnect. Its just you build it, The question is, are we interconnecting it into your building for the power to be used on site Or are you exporting it out to the grid for that power to go to, you know, BG E, right? \n\n\n\n7:02 | Patrick\n\nSure. I understand. \n\n\n\n7:08 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n7:32 | Colin\n\nSo, if its being used on site, thats typically structured in whats known as a power purchase agreement. So, like, if, and maybe Ill ask this, what, how is the bill structure done on your building? Like, whos do you have tenants? And theyre paying the bills? And? \n\n\n\n7:53 | Patrick\n\nWe, we have, there actually, theres three buildings on site two and two, two of them. Well, forget the third building. Its just a little small building. So, we dont have to deal with that. But the other two buildings, have a single meter. We are built for all the electric and we rebuild tenants on a, on a fortunate basis. So, the tenants basically pay for it, But no, but there are no, nobody is separately metered. Theres just one meter, Well, maybe two meters because theres two buildings but. \n\n\n\n8:17 | Colin\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n8:22 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n8:28 | Colin\n\nPerfect. \n\n\n\n8:32 | Colin\n\nPerfect. So that I can talk into, you know, we can get into a later conversation what I think my recommendation would be, but that actually is a very good candidate for net metered behind the meter, PPA. So, basically, in that scenario finance, we work out a deal. The financier pays us to build it. So we build a system. You dont pay for it under a power purchase agreement. What happens is the power is being used in the building And we get you a rate thats lower than what youre currently paying BG E and its locked and its locked in. So itll never go up over time. So its a fixed rate. You dont have to pay all the taxes and fees and its, you know, should be a good size depending on your rate. It should be a good amount lower. So, its really a nice rate protection, and savings if youre paying the bill, \n\n\n\n8:39 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n8:47 | Patrick\n\nHmm. \n\n\n\n8:53 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n9:04 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n9:23 | Patrick\n\nAnd thats basically feeding thats using the solar generated power to offset the cost from the power suppliers. \n\n\n\n9:33 | Colin\n\nCorrect. So, lets say youre, I dont know how much power you use a year, but lets say its 500,000 kilowatt hours a year. Im, just making something up, right? If we design a system and it does its set to do 500,000 a year, then essentially, you know, there are some fixed costs you pay the grid, but essentially, youre just switching Instead of buying that from BG E at, you know, a higher rate that goes up every year. Youre going to just buy it at a lower rate thats fixed and never go up. You buy it from the financier. So youre, your benefit is that saving that gap in the rate and the savings and that savings grows over time because that rate never goes up. \n\n\n\n9:43 | Patrick\n\nNo. \n\n\n\n10:09 | Patrick\n\nInteresting. I think our, I think our annual electric cost is about, you know, 125,000 dollars. \n\n\n\n10:17 | Colin\n\nI dont know. \n\n\n\n10:19 | Patrick\n\nYeah, I think that Id have to, Id have to look at the budget, but thats my recollection that were probably around 200,000 for the gas and electric. And, oh, \n\n\n\n10:24 | Colin\n\nI mean, my, yeah. So my back of the napkin math, thats probably like 900,000 kilowatt hours. So thats a lot, thats a lot of power usage, right? So, and Ill explain the other option to do it. And then Ill explain how I identify, which I think might be best for a client. So, the other option is the one you described, which is its called Community Solar. But basically, what happens is we build the system the same, presumably, the same exact system, right? It doesnt change in how we build it. We get paid to build it. What happens is, instead of interconnecting it into the building, BG E comes in, puts a, you know, a meter, a feeder meter, and then we tie into that and all the power just exports completely out to the grid And, you know, the asset owner gets paid for that. But then they turn around and give you a lease payment. So, instead of saving instead of savings, its now an income scenario where youre, now generating income like a rent paying tenant. \n\n\n\n10:44 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n10:58 | Patrick\n\nRight. \n\n\n\n11:21 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n11:30 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n11:32 | Colin\n\nId say the first model is more common. Its, whats traditionally been done? The Community Solar is a newer model with newer legislation in the state over the past couple of years. Its a great model. Here is my way. I try to determine what is the best fit over to us. If you can use, if you pay the bill and you can use all the power in one meter. Generally speaking, youre typically going to have youre going to have more benefit, The savings youd get in, that is going to be greater than the lease payment youd get on the other side, if that makes sense. \n\n\n\n11:58 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n12:07 | Patrick\n\nYep. Okay. \n\n\n\n12:08 | Colin\n\nThe reason Community Solar is much more appealing is where its like, we like Klein, right? Klein has a shopping center with six tenants in it, And those tenants have different, each has a different meter and the tenants pay their own bills. And the tenants are on various contract terms. That would be a logistical nightmare to try to tie that in. Thats where it makes much more sense to just export it all out direct paying tenants. So if you told me like if you had said, hey, Ive, got three meters and my tenant pays them, blah, blah, blah. Id, be like, yeah, its probably better for Community Solar Or if you have way more roof space to fit panels than the power you need. So, for example, were doing a project for Pompeii and Olive Oil over on the other side of the city, They have a massive warehouse. \n\n\n\n12:20 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n12:26 | Patrick\n\nBye. \n\n\n\n12:33 | Patrick\n\nRight? \n\n\n\n13:00 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n13:02 | Colin\n\nThe amount of solar they can fit on that warehouse is like six times the usage in the building. So, obviously, in that scenario, it makes sense to do a larger system and export it out than a really small system to use. So, like in your scenario, so, if we can build a system that all the power can be used on site and its kind of one or two meters. And you pay that anyway, typically its a better deal in the long run to do that. And the reason is mainly because youre not youre, like not taxed on the, youre, not taxed on the savings. But if you have now an income generation, youre gonna get taxed on that. \n\n\n\n13:10 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n13:25 | Patrick\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n13:34 | Patrick\n\nBye. \n\n\n\n13:43 | Patrick\n\nRight. \n\n\n\n13:44 | Colin\n\nThe other thing is just, theres more cost involved to build because BG E, BG E has to get paid to go put this meter in. That doesnt exist. So, theyre, you know, their costs, they have their costs. \n\n\n\n13:56 | Patrick\n\nBye. \n\n\n\n13:58 | Colin\n\nAnd then there are some challenges, you know, you dont own the system. I mean, you essentially become a small, I mean, youre, basically a small power plant. \n\n\n\n14:08 | Colin\n\nI mean, really, So like even though you dont own it, theres some additional sort of like red tape and stuff in the contract about like what you can and cant do with your property because youre like a facilitator. So its still a great option. I just if someone can use all the power and pays the bill, its generally speaking, youre going to get a better deal. Do in the net meter PPA, where you just have an agreement to buy the power at a lower rate and have the savings. \n\n\n\n14:08 | Patrick\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n14:33 | Patrick\n\nOkay. The savings are greater, than the income would be. \n\n\n\n14:37 | Colin\n\nYeah. Most times we pencil it, the savings are going to be greater than the lease payment, And the savings grows over time. So typically like the lease payment is going to stay the same every year, but your savings as utility rates go up over time, the equivalent savings grows because we know utility rates go up over time, right? So when we model, it, you know, especially like BG E right now is talking about like 15 to 16 percent rate increases over the next couple years. \n\n\n\n15:01 | Patrick\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n15:12 | Patrick\n\nMm. Hmm. \n\n\n\n15:12 | Colin\n\nSo, its just a good, its, a good protection. So, thats sort of like, you know, the four circles of like, hey, a financier, a developer, a GC labor, We cover those GC developer labor. And what we do is depending on how you want to structure, depending on, whether you want community solar or we want net metering, we have various finance partners and we help, we kind of go to them and say, look heres whats going to cost. We have, we kind of, you know, we have the ones we work with, but they know, I kind of, I dont want to say pit them against each other, but, we make sure that theyre competitive and bring the best offer to the table, \n\n\n\n15:37 | Patrick\n\nBye. \n\n\n\n15:47 | Patrick\n\nSure. I mean, just like us, if were financing a building, we talk to multiple lenders. \n\n\n\n15:52 | Colin\n\nExactly. So, it, its sort of interesting. So, what we do is, we establish like, a good price to build the system. Thats thats comfortable for us to build it in a good timeline. We go out to the financers and make them, you know, make them compete like a lender would. So someone landscape, what theyre going to do is theyll bring in sort of a lender, Theyll get the deal and then theyll come to us, a company like us and make us for it. So theyll get one or two or three construction companies, solar, construction companies to bid on it. And, the problem is like, you dont want the construction companies cutting the call, cutting the corners, right? Its, like the finance companies is like money on paper really, But like, if youre going to the GCs and be like, Hey, youre, all competing for this, get your, get the price low? \n\n\n\n16:07 | Patrick\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n16:13 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n16:24 | Patrick\n\nRight. Yep. \n\n\n\n16:34 | Patrick\n\nRight. \n\n\n\n16:45 | Colin\n\nAll, it does like, we get our price to win it, but then you have change orders when things pop up and it just slows the whole thing down. But it, yeah. So, so yeah, I mean, I think, and like I have nothing, I mean, Solar Lantips, a great company. We, like I said, weve theyve subbed some stuff to us, But I think, theyre, predominantly doing the, the community. So, I think theyre exclusively doing community solar. And its a good, its a good model. I just, its not, right? It just depends on the application and what someones trying to do. So, I mean, we can show it both ways. And then the last thing Ill, say, you, it sounds like you had roof work done recently. But one of the things we sort of, I always sort of look for any sort of pain point that someone might have. So, like, usually, it might be a roof and we can say, look, we can give you some upfront money to help cover some costs like a roof, in exchange for like a higher rate. So, you basically fund, you basically finance it with it. So, like, for example, were doing a, were doing a Joppa town marketplace, which is a Quartus property and they needed a brand new roof which was going to be like 100,000 dollars. So Were giving them 800,000, That is a very, its, a large project, but were giving them 800,000 dollars up front. And, instead of getting a lower rate, theyre just getting the same rate that they have right now locked in. So, theyre, like, well, you know, hey, if you can pay for our roof, we dont need a lower rate, Just give us the same rate and you can tell me its never going to go up and we get our roof paid for Like, Ill take that. \n\n\n\n16:46 | Patrick\n\nAll right. \n\n\n\n16:52 | Patrick\n\nNo, i understand. Lowest place isnt necessarily the best deal. \n\n\n\n17:13 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n17:30 | Patrick\n\nWe have, yes. \n\n\n\n17:49 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n17:58 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n18:03 | Patrick\n\nRight. \n\n\n\n18:11 | Patrick\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n18:29 | Patrick\n\nYeah. And theyre, passing through those costs to their tenants anyway, so. \n\n\n\n18:32 | Colin\n\nRight. Yeah. So, yeah, for them, it was a, it was sort of a no brainer, Its like, hey, we get the same exact rate. We now know it doesnt get up and you just paid for our roof. So, \n\n\n\n18:42 | Patrick\n\nYeah, we redid all the lighting four or five years ago under a similar program where BG E or somebody basically paid for all the new lights and then we took it out of our rate. \n\n\n\n18:48 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n18:55 | Colin\n\nFinancing your electric bill or something, right? Yeah. So thats I mean, thats sort of the high level gist. I mean, that sounds so like the next step. What I, if youre like, hey, this, yeah, this sounds like something Id potentially be interested in. And then. \n\n\n\n18:58 | Patrick\n\nYep, exactly. Exactly. \n\n\n\n19:13 | Patrick\n\nWere certainly were certainly interested. Theres a couple of conflicting issues. One, is that one is that the, although we are billed for the electric, all that cost gets passed through the tenants. So we get reimbursed from the tenants\u2026 To the degree that we reduce that cost, it benefits the tenants, which is good, but it doesnt benefit the landlord directly. \n\n\n\n19:19 | Colin\n\nMm. Hmm. \n\n\n\n19:28 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n19:41 | Colin\n\nSo, you cant keep, you cant keep your billing to them the same while the reduction is to you, You have to pass that through one to one. \n\n\n\n19:51 | Patrick\n\nYeah, youre not actually landlords arent allowed to effectively mark up utility costs. I mean, thats against the law. \n\n\n\n19:57 | Colin\n\nHmm. Yep. \n\n\n\n20:02 | Colin\n\nYou could, I mean, some entities are just structured in their lease payment where they just say, hey, like youve been averaging like, you know, 500 dollars a month? Can we just do a 500 dollar a month lease bump? And then well take care of the electric bill? You could, you could do that? \n\n\n\n20:18 | Patrick\n\nYeah, theres some ways theres some ways to work around it although weve got 80 tenants on this project. So itd be fairly complicated to do that? \n\n\n\n20:28 | Colin\n\nSure. Yeah, thats fair. Yeah. So, that would be a little wrinkle. Yeah, that would be one little wrinkle. \n\n\n\n20:30 | Patrick\n\nSo, thats just one issue. I mean. \n\n\n\n20:36 | Patrick\n\nTheres a couple aspects to that, You know, landlord. There are also regulations being faced in that require buildings to achieve a higher level of efficiency, And this is one way to attack that problem. \n\n\n\n20:47 | Colin\n\nMm. Hmm. \n\n\n\n20:50 | Patrick\n\nSo, theres a couple aspects to it that we need to, we need to think about how, whats the most beneficial way to do this, So. \n\n\n\n20:51 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n21:03 | Colin\n\nYeah. And I can, I mean, I can show both options for, the lease payment routes, and then the net metered route, to see what sort of, you know, makes the most sense. Typically, I think typically the community solar projects arent on pitched roofs, and this is what the final size is when I design it, but this is going to probably be on the smaller size. Like usually community solar projects, they went a little bit bigger because of all the fixed costs to do the, you know, BGD engineering and stuff. But, why not? So usually this, I have this initial kind of discovery call just to see like, hey, are we kind of aligned on, you know, whats in the field? Yeah, that sounds good. Id, like to see some more specific numbers. I can do a system design for the building and just show sort of the difference in, you know, the rate savings versus the, yeah. So, the lease payments? \n\n\n\n21:11 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n21:32 | Patrick\n\nAll right. \n\n\n\n21:47 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n21:55 | Patrick\n\nWould you, would you need copies of our utility bills to be able to do that? \n\n\n\n22:01 | Colin\n\nYeah, if you dont if you dont mind, I mean, I have a general understanding of kind of BGD rates. I mean, do you have a third party supply rate? \n\n\n\n22:06 | Patrick\n\nYes, we do. And I cant tell you offhand who it is, my property manager, but I dont know off the top of my head, I just dont know. I dont know, I mean, I know we, Okay. Im, sure your email is in the, you have an email address there. So I can, I get copies of those and have them emailed over to you? Yeah. \n\n\n\n22:11 | Colin\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n22:17 | Colin\n\nIs it through Constellation, you think? Or someone else? Okay. Yeah, if you have a copy, Id, have you take a look? \n\n\n\n22:28 | Colin\n\nAnd then, \n\n\n\n22:36 | Colin\n\nyep. And then just real quick to some questions. Just a couple of questions on the property. Let me see here. So, I noticed theres sort of the brown or reddish roof. So its all pitched roof, right? Theres, that small flat roof, but the main building is pitched. \n\n\n\n22:54 | Patrick\n\nWell, the main building is half of its, a pitch is a flat roof and half of its a pitch roof? Thats the one we just replaced out a year and a half ago. So, if youre, looking at it on Google Earth, what would be the east half of the building, is white and thats all brand new? \n\n\n\n23:05 | Colin\n\nLet me see. \n\n\n\n23:13 | Colin\n\nThats and thats flat. \n\n\n\n23:17 | Patrick\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n23:17 | Colin\n\nOh, interesting. Its got like a, its got a strip down the middle that makes it look like a ridge, but I guess, interesting, Yeah, from Google Earth, its got like a. \n\n\n\n23:25 | Patrick\n\nWell, that may be slightly pitched for drainage purposes. \n\n\n\n23:32 | Colin\n\nYeah, but thats flat. Okay, Thats thats good to know. Thats makes it easier. And then the brown is pitched. And then, youve got like it looks like the Goodyear or something, on the end. Thats a little, thats kind of pitched facing south. \n\n\n\n23:38 | Patrick\n\nRight. \n\n\n\n23:45 | Patrick\n\nYep. Yeah. Theres three different roof sections in the main building, and then the, to the side, what we refer to as the annex, is a two or 3,000 square foot roof That is an old roof Thats a flat, its flat, but its old, That, that roof needs to be replaced. \n\n\n\n24:03 | Colin\n\nIs that whats showing up as like the acupuncture center or something Or the, its putting a dot there? Like maybe theyre all just saying, but its a little, its like a little roof, right right on the back, right on Chestnut Ave. \n\n\n\n24:14 | Patrick\n\nWell, \n\n\n\n24:19 | Colin\n\nVery small, like little pitched roof, I think. And then, and then on the back, you have a flat roof with a couple tenants in there. \n\n\n\n24:27 | Patrick\n\nYeah, theres really, yeah, theres two main buildings, although the address is Chestnut Avenue. Thats really not the main entry. The main entry is on the back side of the buildings and theres an alley that runs between the two main buildings. So, exactly. Yep, Its called Darby, basically an alley, and the large building, on the Chestnut Avenue side, again, just had Its about half a flat roof that was just replaced. \n\n\n\n24:41 | Colin\n\nI see that Darby Street and Mill Road basically back there. Yeah. \n\n\n\n24:48 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n24:59 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n25:02 | Patrick\n\nWas replaced. Half of it was replaced at the same time the flat roof was put on. The other half, we replaced seven or eight years ago. So, theyre, all that is relatively new. And then the small building on the other side of Darby is half flat roof and half pitch roof. And the flat roof was just replaced two months ago. And, and the pitch roof is, I dont know how old the pitch roof is, That may need to be replaced. Thats something that. \n\n\n\n25:28 | Colin\n\nGot it. \n\n\n\n25:34 | Colin\n\nIt looks like the, it looks like the flat roof on that small one by Darby is a little older or was that replaced too? \n\n\n\n25:41 | Patrick\n\nNo, thats the one that the small one thats on what wed, call the annex. Its, the annex is connected to the main building by a bridge. You can see, theres a physical connection. That roof hasnt been replaced in God knows how many years That needs to be replaced. So, yeah, wed, have to identify, wed, have to replace that roof. And we have to have more look at the pitch roof, on the, other side of Darby, because, I dont know, We bought this project in 2013, and we havent done anything with that pitch roof. So, I, it could be 25 years old. I just dont know. So, theres some investigation we need to do on a couple of these things to see whether it would make sense, to, to install a platform over the top of a roof thats 20 years old. \n\n\n\n25:47 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n26:01 | Colin\n\nOkay. So, that could be a pain point to identify if that was, yeah. \n\n\n\n26:18 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n26:26 | Colin\n\nOkay. Makes sense. \n\n\n\n26:44 | Colin\n\nYeah. I mean, well, what we would do is roll that into the deal and say, hey, heres, you know, heres the rate or heres, the lease payment and its factoring in replacing that roof, like giving money towards replacing that roof. Thats thats usually what we do especially on something smaller like that. \n\n\n\n26:48 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n26:57 | Patrick\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n27:00 | Patrick\n\nOkay. All right. Well, well, take a look at that From a physical point of view. Were surrounded by residential, by townhouses, and we are down in, a bit of a valley. So, many of the residents, are at our roof level or higher And, what visual effect would the, would this have on the neighbors? I mean, Im, thinking of reflected light or glare or is this something thats going to disturb the neighbors? \n\n\n\n27:02 | Colin\n\nAnd, mm, hmm. \n\n\n\n27:09 | Colin\n\nYep. \n\n\n\n27:20 | Colin\n\nMm. Hmm. \n\n\n\n27:29 | Colin\n\nNo. \n\n\n\n27:31 | Colin\n\nNo, I mean, theyre, anti glare. I mean, its not like its reflecting back in, their windows. I mean, obviously, if you look at the roof, I mean, youre going to see panels up there, but like its just going to, theyre, all, you know, we use typically an all black panel. So, its, I bet you, if you ask any of those residents, whats the color of that roof up there without looking, they wouldnt even know the color of the roof. So, its like, I doubt, but I mean, its a fair point. But yeah, its anti reflection. \n\n\n\n27:42 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n27:46 | Patrick\n\nOkay. Theres no. \n\n\n\n27:54 | Patrick\n\nYeah, Right. Okay. \n\n\n\n28:01 | Patrick\n\nOkay. So, again, Im, not sure you can see this in Google Earth, but the, the shingle roof, pitch roof in the main building, houses a whole bunch of art studios And the studios on the top floor, third floor, on that end of the building, all have, automatic ventilating systems plugged in, plugged into the roof, to circulate air. And would they just stay in place and theyd be underneath the panels? Is that how that would work? \n\n\n\n28:25 | Colin\n\nMm, hmm. \n\n\n\n28:31 | Colin\n\nHmm. \n\n\n\n28:37 | Colin\n\nAre they like theyre, like vent pipes or theyre, like, yeah, or attic, Its like a, its, like an attic fan kind of thing that youd have in a residential kind of just to circulate air. \n\n\n\n28:39 | Patrick\n\nYeah, Theyre, theyre, its a little fan, Its, a small fan. \n\n\n\n28:49 | Patrick\n\nYeah, except that, yeah, thats what its doing, Its circulating air, but it, its not generating any electric, Its, its wind powered. Basically. So, when, thats on the, not the flat roof, its, on the pitch roof. \n\n\n\n29:00 | Colin\n\nAnd thats on the roof, that older roof, youre, saying thats on that older roof, that older flat roof? \n\n\n\n29:07 | Colin\n\nOh, okay. Yeah, I mean, I see some of those up there. I see what youre talking about. Theyre like little white. Theyre, like little white circles at the ridge. Yeah, we would just install around them. We wouldnt put panels over them. Yeah, thats not a big deal. So, yeah, And then just a couple of questions. I just dont sort of understand. So, just understanding, I always kind of ask these questions to me and just understand like your, you know, paper process or decision making process? I mean, it doesnt sound, it sounds like youre, you dont have like a board, you dont have a board or like walk me through like how decisions get made kind of at the company and what, and like kind of the contracting process too. I mean, do you have in house counsel or like, how does that work usually? \n\n\n\n29:09 | Patrick\n\nIts on the pitch roof? \n\n\n\n29:17 | Patrick\n\nExactly. Okay. \n\n\n\n29:24 | Patrick\n\nSo, yeah. \n\n\n\n29:35 | Patrick\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n29:46 | Patrick\n\nSure. \n\n\n\n29:48 | Patrick\n\nSure. \n\n\n\n29:52 | Patrick\n\nYeah. We typically use Miles Stockbridge, There are kind of our go to council, And we are, there are four of us that are managing partners of this entity. And, actually two of us, My son, and my son is, my partner is a partner, and the two of us basically run the place day to day. So, we do have, we do have two other partners that would have a say in this, But theyre, remote, They dont theyre, not active participants. They basically do whatever we want. So, so theres no board to deal with. Theres no long process, If the economics makes sense, and it looks and theres a benefit to the tenants, a benefit to the project, we write it up, send him, send a memo, tell him. This is what were going to do and theyll sign off on it. And thatll be that. \n\n\n\n29:59 | Colin\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n30:09 | Colin\n\nHmm. \n\n\n\n30:20 | Colin\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n30:38 | Colin\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n30:53 | Colin\n\nYeah, Its always good to know. Youd be surprised or maybe you wouldnt be surprised, how many deals, you know, we spent maybe a year on, just to get to the goal line, and then, you know, its caught up in legal or, you know, business partner doesnt want to do it. So, I always try to get, just understand that a little upfront. \n\n\n\n30:55 | Patrick\n\nYeah, its pretty simple. \n\n\n\n31:06 | Patrick\n\nOh, yeah, I understand. \n\n\n\n31:09 | Patrick\n\nOh, yeah. \n\n\n\n31:12 | Patrick\n\nIts just like its, the, its, developed like developing a commercial building. \n\n\n\n31:13 | Colin\n\nDo you, do you see it as a benefit to Sort of your tenants in a sense of like, you know, when you pitch to tenants to be in the building that, its a, you know, a green building et cetera. I mean, is that an angle, youre, sort of, I mean, obviously, the financial, the financials have to make sense, But I mean, do you see that as part of, your message to the tenants? Nice. You know, one thing, I dont I think, I dont think this would be enough, to sway to make the financials. So, like, one thing Ive seen before is, Hey, there is a benefit, right? Lets say, for example, you did pass, you got a lower rate and you pass that rate through to your tenants. You could look at that and say, Hey, look, this is going to help me retain my tenants, longer term to say, Hey, look, if, you know, when youre, going out tomorrow, if youre, struggling to find tenants, which it doesnt seem like you are. But if its, if locked down long term tenants is a concern, there could be a lot of benefit to say, Hey, look, weve got a locked in, you know, rate, for power, thats cheaper and its green power Like youre, going to have a really low bill, compared to going somewhere else, right? That could be a selling point. \n\n\n\n31:18 | Patrick\n\nHmm. \n\n\n\n31:32 | Patrick\n\nYes. \n\n\n\n31:36 | Patrick\n\nBut yes. \n\n\n\n31:39 | Patrick\n\nI do. Yep. \n\n\n\n32:02 | Patrick\n\nHuh. \n\n\n\n32:14 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n32:27 | Patrick\n\nThank you. \n\n\n\n32:33 | Patrick\n\nThat is a, thats a selling, it is a selling point. No question about it. Yep. \n\n\n\n32:37 | Colin\n\nYeah, The question is just like, is that enough of a selling point to you for you to, you know, straight, pass up through all the benefit directly to them. I dont know. \n\n\n\n32:47 | Patrick\n\nNo, wed, have to look at the economics to see, what the actual savings look like? \n\n\n\n32:49 | Colin\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\n32:52 | Colin\n\nYep. Exactly. Okay. \n\n\n\n32:56 | Patrick\n\nSo, well, let me pull together some BG E, costs some bills. Well, have, Ill ask our property manager to email them over to you or Ill, send them. One of us will Well send them over and take a look and well, see what it looks like. \n\n\n\n33:08 | Colin\n\nOkay. \n\n\n\n33:14 | Colin\n\nAnd youll be the main point person to coordinate through, just kind of reviewing this stuff with you. \n\n\n\n33:19 | Patrick\n\nYeah, probably. \n\n\n\n33:21 | Colin\n\nOkay. All right. Sounds good, Pat. Well, Ill, yeah, if you want to email over whatever you have on the electric bill, youre probably going to have to get the Bee Genie and the supply because the supply you probably get as a separate from the supply company. So, if you just send me the Bee Genie, its probably just going to be the delivery charges. So you might have to chase down the other one as well. \n\n\n\n33:28 | Patrick\n\nCool. \n\n\n\n33:40 | Patrick\n\nOkay. Im sure our bookkeepers got them both. So, all right.

            "Here\u2019s an analysis of Colin\u2019s call based on the refined Discovery Call Template (MEDPICC framework):\n\n### **1. Introduction**\n   - **Greeting and Rapport**: Colin opened the call warmly and referred to connections and prior discussions, setting a personable tone that helped establish rapport.\n   - **Introduction to Lumina Solar**: Colin briefly introduced himself, his role, and Lumina Solar\u2019s capabilities as both a general contractor and partial developer, which provided context for Lumina's comprehensive role in solar projects.\n   - **Agenda and Purpose**: While he informally touched on what they\u2019d discuss, Colin didn\u2019t set a clear agenda, which could have added structure to the conversation.\n\n### **2. Rapport Building**\n   - **Personal Connection**: Colin quickly referenced familiar clients and locations, aligning with Patrick\u2019s experience in real estate development, which helped build a sense of understanding and trust.\n   - **Business-Specific Questions**: Colin asked about Patrick\u2019s understanding of solar and referred to similar projects, helping Patrick feel comfortable with Colin\u2019s expertise. He showed strong knowledge of similar businesses, which built credibility.\n\n### **3. Exploration and Discovery (MEDPICC Framework)**\n   - **Metrics (M)**: Colin discussed potential savings with on-site generation but didn\u2019t probe deeply into specific financial metrics Patrick wanted to target, which could have revealed Patrick\u2019s expectations for savings.\n   - **Economic Buyer (E)**: Colin verified that Patrick and his partners are key decision-makers. He asked about the approval process and in-house counsel but could have explored their priorities to make his proposal more compelling.\n   - **Decision Criteria (D)**: Colin highlighted Lumina\u2019s role as a full-service contractor and developer, which helped differentiate Lumina but didn\u2019t directly address criteria Patrick might use to compare providers. A brief question about benchmarks might have clarified Patrick\u2019s decision process.\n   - **Decision Process (D)**: Colin probed Patrick\u2019s decision-making and contractual process, learning about Patrick\u2019s partners and their straightforward approval system, which demonstrated a thorough approach.\n   - **Paper Process (P)**: Colin discussed general contracting and financing, covering who would own and maintain assets but didn\u2019t go into any specific legal requirements that Patrick might have for contracting.\n   - **Identify Pain (I)**: Colin explored Patrick\u2019s roof issues, tenant billing, and the client\u2019s interest in meeting efficiency regulations. This was effective but could have been expanded with questions about potential impacts of cost increases if solar isn\u2019t implemented.\n   - **Champion (C)**: Colin didn\u2019t identify a potential internal champion who would advocate for the project, missing an opportunity to build internal support.\n   - **Competition (C)**: Colin didn\u2019t ask if Patrick was considering other providers, which could have revealed Patrick\u2019s stance on community solar models.\n\n### **4. Financial and Site Suitability Assessment**\n   - **Site Suitability**: Colin covered roof structure, shading, and general suitability for solar, including details about the different sections of the roof, making his assessment thorough and aligned with the template.\n   - **Investment Model**: He provided a clear comparison between net-metered and community solar options and discussed potential savings versus lease payments, which aligned well with Patrick\u2019s financial concerns.\n\n### **5. Summarize and Confirm Key Insights**\n   - **Recap Key Points**: Colin didn\u2019t provide a concise summary of key takeaways from the discussion, which could have helped clarify next steps.\n   - **Validate Understanding**: Colin confirmed Patrick\u2019s understanding indirectly but didn\u2019t directly validate that Patrick was clear on the options discussed, which might have been beneficial.\n\n### **6. Next Steps and Timeline**\n   - **Outline Immediate Actions**: Colin requested utility bills and mentioned potential options for future calls, outlining basic next steps. A specific timeline for a follow-up meeting would have added structure.\n   - **Set a Follow-Up Date**: He didn\u2019t propose a specific follow-up date, which could have helped solidify Patrick\u2019s commitment and establish a sense of urgency.\n\n### **7. Closing Remarks**\n   - **Thank the Client**: Colin closed with appreciation, though a final statement emphasizing Lumina\u2019s commitment to helping Patrick\u2019s project succeed would reinforce value.\n   - **Reinforce Value and Dedication**: Colin highlighted Lumina\u2019s full-service approach but didn\u2019t explicitly emphasize Lumina\u2019s dedication to Patrick\u2019s long-term savings and tenant satisfaction.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Colin's Strengths and Improvement Areas**\n\n- **Strengths**: Colin excelled in rapport building, suitability assessment, and financial options, especially in providing Patrick with a thorough comparison of community solar and net-metered options.\n- **Improvement Areas**: Colin could improve by setting a clearer agenda, providing a recap at the end, and directly confirming client understanding. Addressing competitive landscape questions, identifying champions, and proposing a follow-up date would also strengthen his calls.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Report Card with Colin\u2019s Scores\n\n| **Discovery Call Component**       | **Description**                                                                   | **Shane (0-10)** | **Mark (0-10)** | **Phil (0-10)** | **Colin (0-10)** |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| **Introduction**                   | Clear introduction, purpose, and agenda set for the call                          | 6                | 5               | 5               | 6                |\n| **Rapport Building**               | Establish rapport by understanding the prospect's business and energy challenges  | 10               | 10              | 10              | 10               |\n| **Metrics (M)**                    | Discuss specific financial metrics, cost impacts, and targets                     | 5                | 3               | 5               | 6                |\n| **Economic Buyer (E)**             | Identify the primary decision-maker and their priorities                          | 6                | 5               | 6               | 7                |\n| **Decision Criteria (D)**          | Clarify criteria or benchmarks used to select a provider                          | 5                | 3               | 5               | 5                |\n| **Decision Process (D)**           | Understand the decision-making and approval process, including timeline           | 5                | 4               | 6               | 8                |\n| **Paper Process (P)**              | Discuss procurement, legal requirements, and contract clauses                     | 4                | 2               | 5               | 6                |\n| **Identify Pain (I)**              | Uncover challenges driving the need for solar and potential impact if unresolved  | 6                | 4               | 5               | 6                |\n| **Champion (C)**                   | Identify internal advocates or champions who would support the solar project      | 0                | 0               | 0               | 0                |\n| **Competition (C)**                | Ask if other providers are being considered or if there are competing solutions   | 0                | 0               | 0               | 0                |\n| **Suitability**                    | Assess site suitability, including structural and location factors                | 10               | 10              | 10              | 10               |\n| **Investment Model**               | Present and discuss different financing models (ownership vs. PPA)                | 10               | 10              | 10              | 10               |\n| **Recap Key Insights**             | Summarize main points and metrics covered in the discussion                       | 0                | 0               | 0               | 0                |\n| **Propose Next Steps**             | Outline specific follow-up actions and expectations                               | 8                | 5               | 6               | 6                |\n| **Confirm Timeline**               | Set a specific follow-up meeting or timeline                                      | 5                | 0               | 4               | 5                |\n| **Thank You and Enthusiasm**       | Express appreciation and reinforce commitment to the client\u2019s goals               | 8                | 8               | 6               | 7                |\n| **Reiterate Commitment**           | Directly emphasize Lumina Solar\u2019s dedication to helping the client                | 5                | 4               | 4               | 6                |\n\n### **Total Scores**\n- **Shane**: 88/160\n- **Mark**: 73/160\n- **Phil**: 77/160\n- **Colin**: 88/160\n\nBoth **Shane** and **Colin** scored the highest at **88/160**.
