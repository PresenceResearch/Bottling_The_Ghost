            "  \r\nJanuary 24, 2025\r\nRodney Myers\r\n Hydro-Terra Group\r\n 7420 Derry Street\r\n Harrisburg, PA 17111\r\nRe: Hydro-Terra \u2013 BAE Water Treatment Facility Solar Installation Update\r\nDear Mr. Myers,\r\nThank you for the opportunity to submit an updated proposal for the 41 kW DC solar photovoltaic array located at 1100 Bairs Road, York, PA 17408.\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nArray Design and Location: Updated to optimize performance and ensure compliance with current regulations.\r\nCost: Updated to reflect current market conditions and regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nScope of Work Update\r\nSolar Modules: 100 Trina 410 Watt modules\r\nRacking System: Pre-engineered to meet the latest safety and structural standards\r\nInverters: SolarEdge DC-to-AC power-optimized, ensuring efficient energy conversion and system monitoring\r\nCompliance: Installation in full compliance with current regulations and standards\r\n\r\nKey Updates\r\nPermits, Interconnection, and Engineering: Redone to comply with significant changes in code interpretation and system scope. This ensures that the project meets the latest regulatory requirements, avoiding potential delays and compliance issues.\r\nMesh Protection: Installed on all panels to meet updated safety standards, enhancing system durability and reducing the risk of accidents.\r\n\r\nProject Inclusions\r\nUpdated project engineering (electrical and site-specific)\r\nRe-application for all required local building permits\r\nRe-submittal of interconnection documents (utility approval and documentation)\r\nFull system installation, including mesh backing on all panels\r\nTrenching from array to interconnection point\r\nGround remediation after trenching\r\nSystem monitoring platform\r\nFinal inspection and system commissioning\r\nPost-install training and handoff\r\n\r\nProject Exclusions\r\nCosts associated with unanticipated jurisdictional or utility requirements, such as utility infrastructure upgrades or additional site preparation.\r\nAdditional expenses related to unforeseen ground cover or structural modifications.\r\n\r\nLumina Solar Fee\r\nTotal Cost: $195,635\r\n\r\nReasons for Cost Increase\r\nChanged Racking Design:\r\n The racking company has revised the array design to better align with current safety and structural standards. This change requires additional materials and labor, increasing the overall project cost. However, a portion of the racking materials already purchased will be utilized in the updated design.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreased Consumables and Electrical Costs:\r\n The prices of consumables and electrical components have risen due to market fluctuations and supply chain challenges. These essential materials are necessary for the installation and proper functioning of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor Costs:\r\n Labor costs represent a significant portion of the project budget. Due to the updated requirements and the need for more detailed and intricate work, the number of labor hours has increased substantially. Additionally, labor rates have risen over the past four years, further impacting the total cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulatory and Compliance Requirements:\r\n The reapplication for permits, interconnection, and engineering is necessary due to changes in code interpretation and system scope. These processes involve additional fees and the time required to complete them, contributing to the overall cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesh Protection:\r\n The installation of mesh protection on the backs of all panels is a new requirement to enhance system safety and durability. This additional measure requires additional materials and labor, increasing the project cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjustments for Purchased Equipment\r\nHydro-Terra has already purchased inverters and a portion of the racking. These costs will be deducted from the total project cost. The remaining balance of $27,665 from the initial $51,000 will be applied to the new project costs, minus storage fees and carrying costs, plus 4% annual interest. The total project cost becomes $167,980.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe updated cost stack for 2025 ensures the project meets all current codes, leverages the latest engineering optimizations, and reflects market-driven changes. These adjustments prioritize safety, durability, and long-term performance.\r\n\r\nAllocation of Funds Received\r\nTo date, Lumina Solar has received $51,000 from Hydro-Terra. $17,822 has been spent on non-reusable services. The remaining balance of $27,665 will be applied to new project costs, minus storage fees and carrying costs, plus 4% annual interest. The total project cost becomes $167,980.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n [Your Name]\r\n Lumina Solar\r\n\r"

This ensures that the project meets the latest regulatory requirements, avoiding potential delays and compliance issues.\r\n- Mesh Protection: Installed on all panels to meet updated safety standards, enhancing system durability and reducing the risk of accidents.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nProject Inclusions\r\n- Updated project engineering (electrical and site-specific)  \r\n- Re-application for all required local building permits  \r\n- Re-submittal of interconnection documents (utility approval and documentation)  \r\n- Full system installation, including mesh backing on all panels  \r\n- Trenching from array to interconnection point  \r\n- Ground remediation after trenching  \r\n- System monitoring platform  \r\n- Final inspection and system commissioning  \r\n- Post-install training and handoff  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nProject Exclusions\r\n- Costs associated with unanticipated jurisdictional or utility requirements, such as utility infrastructure upgrades or additional site preparation.\r\n- Additional expenses related to unforeseen ground cover or structural modifications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLumina Solar Fee\r\nTotal Cost: $195,635\r\n\r\nReasons for Cost Increase\r\n1. Changed Racking Design:  \r\n   The racking company has revised the array design to better align with current safety and structural standards. This change requires additional materials and labor, increasing the overall project cost. However, a portion of the racking materials already purchased will be utilized in the updated design.\r\n\r\n2. Increased Consumables and Electrical Costs:  \r\n   The prices of consumables and electrical components have risen due to market fluctuations and supply chain challenges. These essential materials are necessary for the installation and proper functioning of the system.\r\n\r\n3. Labor Costs:  \r\n   Labor costs represent a significant portion of the project budget. Due to the updated requirements and the need for more detailed and intricate work, the number of labor hours has increased substantially. Additionally, labor rates have risen over the past four years, further impacting the total cost.\r\n\r\n4. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements:  \r\n   The reapplication for permits, interconnection, and engineering is necessary due to changes in code interpretation and system scope. These processes involve additional fees and the time required to complete them, contributing to the overall cost.\r\n\r\n5. Mesh Protection:  \r\n   The installation of mesh protection on the backs of all panels is a new requirement to enhance system safety and durability. This additional measure requires additional materials and labor, increasing the project cost.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdjustments for Purchased Equipment\r\nHydro-Terra has already purchased inverters and a portion of the racking. These costs will be deducted from the total project cost. The remaining balance of $27,665 from the initial $51,000 will be applied to the new project costs, minus storage fees and carrying costs, plus 4% annual interest. The total project cost becomes $167,980.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe updated cost stack for 2025 ensures the project meets all current codes, leverages the latest engineering optimizations, and reflects market-driven changes. These adjustments prioritize safety, durability, and long-term performance.\r\n\r\nAllocation of Funds Received\r\nTo date, Lumina Solar has received $51,000 from Hydro-Terra. $17,822 has been spent on non-reusable services. The remaining balance of $27,665 will be applied to new project costs, minus storage fees and carrying costs, plus 4% annual interest.
