            "can you take this format:  the following memo \r\nThe Opportunity\r\n11 Million Acres, a solar developer based in Chicago, expressed interest in partnering with us. Their Project Delivery Manager, Mike Nakayama, contacted me late last year to inquire about our capacity to install solar arrays on all Dollar General stores within our operational area.\r\nThere are over 60 locations in our Maryland region alone, many of which are located within a half-hour drive of our office.\r\nDollar General Locations - Metro DC and Baltimore\r\n\r\nHowever, not all locations are candidates for solar installations.  Only freestanding stores are being considered at this point, which decreases the amount of viable locations.  I have calculated roughly 30 viable locations within the Baltimore Metro area.  \r\n11 Million Acres has analyzed each location, which allows for easy identification of viable sites.\r\nSample Site Analysis: Note building type \u201cFreestanding\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Partner\r\n\r\n11 Million Acres, a sustainability consulting firm, assists businesses in enhancing their environmental responsibility and operational efficiency. The firm offers a comprehensive suite of services, encompassing energy conservation, distributive energy solutions, microgrids, energy infrastructure, and renewable energy systems. Furthermore, 11 Million Acres provides flexible financing options, including operating and capital leases, tax equity investments, and power purchase agreements. Through these offerings, 11 Million Acres supports businesses in achieving their sustainability objectives while concurrently realizing their financial goals.\r\n\r\nThe Project\r\n\r\n11 Million Acres requires a local partner who can manage the entire process, excluding the procurement of modules, inverters, and racking. Lumina will be responsible for site selection, evaluation, and recommendation of any necessary work that must be completed prior to installation, such as a roof replacement. After sites are evaluated, Lumina will begin the projects as we would any full EPC; site review, structural, permit, interconnection, etc.\r\n\r\nEach site will host a 60 kW system. These systems are uniform throughout the portfolio. Actual design and module placement will be determined by Lumina.\r\n\r\nBelow, please find examples of potential sites in Baltimore:\r\n\r\n717 Washington Blvd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5815 York Road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming:\r\n\r\nPer Mike Nakayama:\r\n\r\n \u201cWe will start with IX applications in February and installs starting mid Q2 or early Q3.\u201d\r\n\r\nProposed install timeline below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScope of Work\r\n\r\n11 Million Acres will rely upon their local partner to visit and evaluate sites, determine suitability, and suggest any remedial work to be completed.  Any roofing replacements or repairs will be handled by Dollar General.\r\n\r\nAfter suitability has been determined, installations will commence.\r\n\r\nScope of Work as outlined in RFP\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nA pipeline of multiple, smaller projects creates a backlog of opportunities that can be integrated into gaps in the installation schedule, regardless of the size of the gap.\r\nProject sizes are such that residential crews can be utilized to supplement efforts should commercial installation teams be unavailable.\r\nNo capital outlay on equipment\r\nMinimal initial use of internal resources.\r\nPredictable cash flow\r\nLarge brand addition to Lumina Portfolio\r\nRisk Exposure::\r\nSolvency of Developer\r\nDeveloper competency\r\nIntermediary position between developer and site host\r\nDelays caused by site unsuitability\r\nOpportunity cost of committing resources to fixed profit projects\r\nPressure from Developer to lower prices for bulk orders\r\nPreconstruction process may be more extensive than expected\r\nLumina's inability to deliver\r\nChange order acceptance\r\nRecommended Next Steps:\r\nReach an agreement on preliminary pricing\r\nCompile a list of Lumina's terms and requirements:\r\nPayment terms\r\nContract structure\r\nInstallation flexibility and timing\r\nProvide to 11 Million Acres and schedule a meeting with their team next week.\r\nAttachment 1 - Pricing Calculations\r\n\r\nFULL EPC PRICE\r\nComponent\r\nPrice ($)\r\nPPW ($)\r\nPanel\r\n 31,800.00\r\n 0.53\r\nInverter\r\n 10,200.00\r\n 0.17\r\nRacking\r\n 10,800.00\r\n 0.18\r\nElectrical\r\n 9,000.00\r\n 0.15\r\nMaterials\r\n 61,800.00\r\n 1.03\r\nLabor\r\n 18,006.78\r\n 0.30\r\nEquipment Rental\r\n 4,000.00\r\n 0.07\r\nEngineering\r\n 3,000.00\r\n 0.05\r\nFleet Costs\r\n 178.20\r\n 0.00\r\nInterconnection\r\n 960.00\r\n 0.02\r\nPermitting\r\n 2,400.00\r\n 0.04\r\nShipping\r\n 600.00\r\n 0.01\r\nSoft Costs\r\n 7,138.20\r\n 0.12\r\nBuild\r\n 91,144.98\r\n 1.52\r\nGross Margin\r\n 61,429.99\r\n 1.02\r\nBuild With Gross Margin\r\n 152,574.97\r\n 2.54\r\nPass-Through Costs\r\n 0.00\r\n 0.00\r\nRep Commission\r\n 6,682.75\r\n 0.11\r\nTotal\r\n 159,257.72\r\n 2.65\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL REMOVAL\r\nComponent\r\nPrice ($)\r\nPanels\r\n31,800.00\r\nInverters\r\n10,200.00\r\nRacking\r\n10,800.00\r\nTotal Removed\r\n52,800.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILD ONLY PRICE\r\nComponent\r\nPrice ($)\r\nPPW ($)\r\nLabor\r\n18,006.78\r\n0.30\r\nEquipment Rental\r\n4,000.00\r\n0.07\r\nEngineering\r\n3,000.00\r\n0.05\r\nFleet Costs\r\n178.20\r\n0.00\r\nInterconnection\r\n960.00\r\n0.02\r\nPermitting\r\n2,400.00\r\n0.04\r\nShipping\r\n600.00\r\n0.01\r\nSoft Costs\r\n7,138.20\r\n0.12\r\nBuild Cost (Adjusted)\r\n38,344.98\r\n0.64\r\nGross Margin\r\n25,850.47\r\n0.43\r\nBuild With Gross Margin\r\n64,195.45\r\n1.07\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGross Margin Opportunity Cost\r\nFull EPC\r\n$61,249\r\nLabor Only\r\n$25,850\r\nOPPORTUNITY COST\r\n$35,579\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILD ONLY WITH OPPORTUNITY COST\r\nComponent\r\nPrice ($)\r\nPPW ($)\r\nLabor\r\n18,006.78\r\n0.30\r\nEquipment Rental\r\n4,000.00\r\n0.07\r\nEngineering\r\n3,000.00\r\n0.05\r\nFleet Costs\r\n178.20\r\n0.00\r\nInterconnection\r\n960.00\r\n0.02\r\nPermitting\r\n2,400.00\r\n0.04\r\nShipping\r\n600.00\r\n0.01\r\nSoft Costs\r\n7,138.20\r\n0.12\r\nAdjusted Build Cost\r\n38,344.98\r\n0.64\r\nGross Margin (Original)\r\n61,429.00\r\n1.01\r\nNew Build With Gross Margin\r\n99,773.98\r\n1.65\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment 2 - Cash Flow Projection\r\nAssumptions:\r\nOne-time payment at PTO.
