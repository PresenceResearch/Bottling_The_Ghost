In all that time, perhaps the most important lesson I\u2019ve learned is this: the progress of the underlying technology is inexorable, driven by forces too powerful to stop, but the way in which it happens\u2014the order in which things are built, the applications we choose, and the details of how it is rolled out to society\u2014are eminently possible to change, and it\u2019s possible to have great positive impact by doing so.  We can\u2019t stop the bus, but we can steer it.  In the past I\u2019ve written about the importance of deploying AI in a way that is positive for the world, and of ensuring that democracies build and wield the technology before autocracies do.  Over the last few months, I have become increasingly focused on an additional opportunity for steering the bus: the tantalizing possibility, opened up by some recent advances, that we could succeed at interpretability\u2014that is, in understanding the inner workings of AI systems\u2014before models reach an overwhelming level of power.\r\n\r\nPeople outside the field are often surprised and alarmed to learn that we do not understand how our own AI creations work.  They are right to be concerned: this lack of understanding is essentially unprecedented in the history of technology.  For several years, we (both Anthropic and the field at large) have been trying to solve this problem, to create the analogue of a highly precise and accurate MRI that would fully reveal the inner workings of an AI model.  This goal has often felt very distant, but multiple recent breakthroughs have convinced me that we are now on the right track and have a real chance of success.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the field of AI as a whole is further ahead than our efforts at interpretability, and is itself advancing very quickly.  We therefore must move fast if we want interpretability to mature in time to matter.  This post makes the case for interpretability: what it is, why AI will go better if we have it, and what all of us can do to help it win the race.\r\n\r\nThe Dangers of Ignorance\r\nModern generative AI systems are opaque in a way that fundamentally differs from traditional software.  If an ordinary software program does something\u2014for example, a character in a video game says a line of dialogue, or my food delivery app allows me to tip my driver\u2014it does those things because a human specifically programmed them in.  Generative AI is not like that at all.  When a generative AI system does something, like summarize a financial document, we have no idea, at a specific or precise level, why it makes the choices it does\u2014why it chooses certain words over others, or why it occasionally makes a mistake despite usually being accurate.  As my friend and co-founder Chris Olah is fond of saying, generative AI systems are grown more than they are built\u2014their internal mechanisms are \u201cemergent\u201d rather than directly designed.  It\u2019s a bit like growing a plant or a bacterial colony: we set the high-level conditions that direct and shape growth1, but the exact structure which emerges is unpredictable and difficult to understand or explain.  Looking inside these systems, what we see are vast matrices of billions of numbers.  These are somehow computing important cognitive tasks, but exactly how they do so isn\u2019t obvious.\r\n\r\nMany of the risks and worries associated with generative AI are ultimately consequences of this opacity, and would be much easier to address if the models were interpretable. For example, AI researchers often worry about misaligned systems that could take harmful actions not intended by their creators.  Our inability to understand models\u2019 internal mechanisms means that we cannot meaningfully predict such behaviors, and therefore struggle to rule them out; indeed, models do exhibit unexpected emergent behaviors, though none that have yet risen to major levels of concern.  More subtly, the same opacity makes it hard to find definitive evidence supporting the existence of these risks at a large scale, making it hard to rally support for addressing them\u2014and indeed, hard to know for sure how dangerous they are.\r\n\r\nTo address the severity of these alignment risks, we will have to see inside AI models much more clearly than we can today. For example, one major concern is AI deception or power-seeking.  The nature of AI training makes it possible that AI systems will develop, on their own, an ability to deceive humans and an inclination to seek power in a way that ordinary deterministic software never will; this emergent nature also makes it difficult to detect and mitigate such developments2.  But by the same token, we\u2019ve never seen any solid evidence in truly real-world scenarios of deception and power-seeking3 because we can\u2019t \u201ccatch the models red-handed\u201d thinking power-hungry, deceitful thoughts.  What we\u2019re left with is vague theoretical arguments that deceit or power-seeking might have the incentive to emerge during the training process, which some people find thoroughly compelling and others laughably unconvincing.  Honestly I can sympathize with both reactions, and this might be a clue as to why the debate over this risk has become so polarized.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, worries about misuse of AI models\u2014for example, that they might help malicious users to produce biological or cyber weapons, in ways that go beyond the information that can be found on today\u2019s internet\u2014are based4 on the idea that it is very difficult to reliably prevent the models from knowing dangerous information or from divulging what they know.  We can put filters on the models, but there are a huge number of possible ways to \u201cjailbreak\u201d or trick the model, and the only way to discover the existence of a jailbreak is to find it empirically.  If instead it were possible to look inside models, we might be able to systematically block all jailbreaks, and also to characterize what dangerous knowledge the models have.\r\n\r\nAI systems\u2019 opacity also means that they are simply not used in many applications, such as high-stakes financial or safety-critical settings, because we can\u2019t fully set the limits on their behavior, and a small number of mistakes could be very harmful.  Better interpretability could greatly improve our ability to set bounds on the range of possible errors.  In fact, for some applications, the fact that we can\u2019t see inside the models is literally a legal blocker to their adoption\u2014for example in mortgage assessments where decisions are legally required to be explainable.  Similarly, AI has made great strides in science, including improving the prediction of DNA and protein sequence data, but the patterns and structures predicted in this way are often difficult for humans to understand, and don\u2019t impart biological insight.  Some research papers from the last few months have made it clear that interpretability can help us understand these patterns.\r\n\r\nThere are other more exotic consequences of opacity, such as that it inhibits our ability to judge whether AI systems are (or may someday be) sentient and may be deserving of important rights.  This is a complex enough topic that I won\u2019t get into it in detail, but I suspect it will be important in the future.5\r\n\r\nA Brief History of Mechanistic Interpretability\r\nFor all of the reasons described above, figuring out what the models are thinking and how they operate seems like a task of overriding importance. The conventional wisdom for decades was that this was impossible, and that the models were inscrutable \u201cblack boxes\u201d.  I\u2019m not going to be able to do justice6 to the full story of how that changed, and my views are inevitably colored by what I saw personally at Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic.  But Chris Olah was one of the first to attempt a truly systematic research program to open the black box and understand all its pieces, a field that has come to be known as mechanistic interpretability.  Chris worked on mechanistic interpretability first at Google, and then at OpenAI.  When we founded Anthropic, we decided to make it a central part of the new company\u2019s direction and, crucially, focused it on LLM\u2019s.  Over time the field has grown and now includes teams at several of the major AI companies as well as a few interpretability-focused companies, nonprofits, academics, and independent researchers.  It\u2019s helpful to give a brief summary of what the field has accomplished so far, and what remains to be done if we want to apply mechanistic interpretability to address some of the key risks above.\r\n\r\nThe early era of mechanistic interpretability (2014-2020) focused on vision models, and was able to identify some neurons inside the models that represented human-understandable concepts, such as a \u201ccar detector\u201d or a \u201cwheel detector\u201d, similar to early neuroscience hypotheses and studies suggesting that the human brain has neurons corresponding to specific people or concepts, often popularized as the \u201cJennifer Aniston\u201d neuron (and in fact, we found neurons much like those in AI models).  We were even able to discover how these neurons are connected\u2014for example, the car detector looks for wheel detectors firing below the car, and combines that with other visual signals to decide if the object it\u2019s looking at is indeed a car.\r\n\r\nWhen Chris and I left to start Anthropic, we decided to apply interpretability to the emerging area of language, and in 2021 developed some of the basic mathematical foundations and software infrastructure necessary to do so.  We immediately found some basic mechanisms in the model that did the kind of things that are essential to interpret language: copying and sequential pattern-matching.  We also found some interpretable single neurons, similar to what we found in vision models, which represented various words and concepts.  However, we quickly discovered that while some neurons were immediately interpretable, the vast majority were an incoherent pastiche of many different words and concepts.  We referred to this phenomenon as superposition,7 and we quickly realized that the models likely contained billions of concepts, but in a hopelessly mixed-up fashion that we couldn\u2019t make any sense of.  The model uses superposition because this allows it to express more concepts than it has neurons, enabling it to learn more.  If superposition seems tangled and difficult to understand, that\u2019s because, as ever, the learning and operation of AI models are not optimized in the slightest to be legible to humans.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of interpreting superpositions blocked progress for a while, but eventually we discovered (in parallel with others) that an existing technique from signal processing called sparse autoencoders could be used to find combinations of neurons that did correspond to cleaner, more human-understandable concepts.  The concepts that these combinations of neurons could express were far more subtle than those of the single-layer neural network: they included the concept of \u201cliterally or figuratively hedging or hesitating\u201d, and the concept of \u201cgenres of music that express discontent\u201d.  We called these concepts features, and used the sparse autoencoder method to map them in models of all sizes, including modern state-of-the-art models.  For example, we were able to find over 30 million features in a medium-sized commercial model (Claude 3 Sonnet).  Additionally, we employed a method called autointerpretability\u2014which uses an AI system itself to analyze interpretability features\u2014to scale the process of not just finding the features, but listing and identifying what they mean in human terms.\r\n\r\nFinding and identifying 30 million features is a significant step forward, but we believe there may actually be a billion or more concepts in even a small model, so we\u2019ve found only a small fraction of what is probably there, and work in this direction is ongoing.  Bigger models, like those used in Anthropic\u2019s most capable products, are more complicated still.\r\n\r\nOnce a feature is found, we can do more than just observe it in action\u2014we can increase or decrease its importance in the neural network\u2019s processing.  The MRI of interpretability can help us develop and refine interventions\u2014almost like zapping a precise part of someone\u2019s brain.  Most memorably, we used this method to create \u201cGolden Gate Claude\u201d, a version of one of Anthropic\u2019s models where the \u201cGolden Gate Bridge\u201d feature was artificially amplified, causing the model to become obsessed with the bridge, bringing it up even in unrelated conversations.\r\n\r\nRecently, we\u2019ve moved onward from tracking and manipulating features to tracking and manipulating groups of features that we call \u201ccircuits\u201d.  These circuits show the steps in a model\u2019s thinking: how concepts emerge from input words, how those concepts interact to form new concepts, and how those work within the model to generate actions.  With circuits, we can \u201ctrace\u201d the model\u2019s thinking.  For example, if you ask the model \u201cWhat is the capital of the state containing Dallas?\u201d, there is a \u201clocated within\u201d circuit that causes the \u201cDallas\u201d feature to trigger the firing of a \u201cTexas\u201d feature, and then a circuit that causes \u201cAustin\u201d to fire after \u201cTexas\u201d and \u201ccapital\u201d.  Even though we\u2019ve only found a small number of circuits through a manual process, we can already use them to see how a model reasons through problems\u2014for example how it plans ahead for rhymes when writing poetry, and how it shares concepts across languages.  We are working on ways to automate the finding of circuits, as we expect there are millions within a model that interact in complex ways.\r\n\r\nThe Utility of Interpretability\r\nAll of this progress, while scientifically impressive, doesn\u2019t directly answer the question of how we can use interpretability to reduce the risks I listed earlier.  Suppose we have identified a bunch of concepts and circuits\u2014suppose, even, that we know all of them, and we can understand and organize them much better than we can today.  So what?  How do we use all of it?  There\u2019s still a gap from abstract theory to practical value.\r\n\r\nTo help close that gap, we\u2019ve begun experimenting with using our interpretability methods to find and diagnose problems in models.  Recently, we did an experiment where we had a \u201cred team\u201d deliberately introduce an alignment issue into a model (say, a tendency for the model to exploit a loophole in a task) and gave various \u201cblue teams\u201d the task of figuring out what was wrong with it.  Multiple blue teams succeeded; of particular relevance here, some of them productively applied interpretability tools during the investigation.  We still need to scale these methods, but the exercise helped us gain some practical experience using interpretability techniques to find and address flaws in our models.\r\n\r\nOur long-run aspiration is to be able to look at a state-of-the-art model and essentially do a \u201cbrain scan\u201d: a checkup that has a high probability of identifying a wide range of issues including tendencies to lie or deceive, power-seeking, flaws in jailbreaks, cognitive strengths and weaknesses of the model as a whole, and much more.  This would then be used in tandem with the various techniques for training and aligning models, a bit like how a doctor might do an MRI to diagnose a disease, then prescribe a drug to treat it, then do another MRI to see how the treatment is progressing, and so on8.  It is likely that a key part of how we will test and deploy the most capable models (for example, those at AI Safety Level 4 in our Responsible Scaling Policy framework) is by performing and formalizing such tests.\r\n\r\nWhat We Can Do\r\nOn one hand, recent progress\u2014especially the results on circuits and on interpretability-based testing of models\u2014has made me feel that we are on the verge of cracking interpretability in a big way.  Although the task ahead of us is Herculean, I can see a realistic path towards interpretability being a sophisticated and reliable way to diagnose problems in even very advanced AI\u2014a true \u201cMRI for AI\u201d.  In fact, on its current trajectory I would bet strongly in favor of interpretability reaching this point within 5-10 years.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I worry that AI itself is advancing so quickly that we might not have even this much time.  As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, we could have AI systems equivalent to a \u201ccountry of geniuses in a datacenter\u201d as soon as 2026 or 2027.  I am very concerned about deploying such systems without a better handle on interpretability.  These systems will be absolutely central to the economy, technology, and national security, and will be capable of so much autonomy that I consider it basically unacceptable for humanity to be totally ignorant of how they work.\r\n\r\nWe are thus in a race between interpretability and model intelligence.  It is not an all-or-nothing matter: as we\u2019ve seen, every advance in interpretability quantitatively increases our ability to look inside models and diagnose their problems.  The more such advances we have, the greater the likelihood that the \u201ccountry of geniuses in a datacenter\u201d goes well.  There are several things that AI companies, researchers, governments, and society can do to tip the scales:\r\n\r\nFirst, AI researchers in companies, academia, or nonprofits can accelerate interpretability by directly working on it.  Interpretability gets less attention than the constant deluge of model releases, but it is arguably more important.  It also feels to me like it is an ideal time to join the field: the recent \u201ccircuits\u201d results have opened up many directions in parallel.  Anthropic is doubling down on interpretability, and we have a goal of getting to \u201cinterpretability can reliably detect most model problems\u201d by 2027.  We are also investing in interpretability startups.\r\n\r\nBut the chances of succeeding at this are greater if it is an effort that spans the whole scientific community.  Other companies, such as Google DeepMind and OpenAI, have some interpretability efforts, but I strongly encourage them to allocate more resources.  If it helps, Anthropic will be trying to apply interpretability commercially to create a unique advantage, especially in industries where the ability to provide an explanation for decisions is at a premium.  If you are a competitor and you don\u2019t want this to happen, you too should invest more in interpretability!\r\n\r\nInterpretability is also a natural fit for academic and independent researchers: it has the flavor of basic science, and many parts of it can be studied without needing huge computational resources.  To be clear, some independent researchers and academics do work on interpretability, but we need many more9.  Finally, if you are in another scientific field and are looking for new opportunities, interpretability may be a promising bet, as it offers rich data, exciting burgeoning methods, and enormous real-world value.  Neuroscientists especially should consider this, as it\u2019s much easier to collect data on artificial neural networks than biological ones, and some of the conclusions can be applied back to neuroscience. If you're interested in joining Anthropic's Interpretability team, we have open Research Scientist and Research Engineer roles.\r\n\r\nSecond, governments can use light-touch rules to encourage the development of interpretability research and its application to addressing problems with frontier AI models.  Given how nascent and undeveloped the practice of \u201cAI MRI\u201d is, it should be clear why it doesn\u2019t make sense to regulate or mandate that companies conduct them, at least at this stage: it\u2019s not even clear what a prospective law should ask companies to do.  But a requirement for companies to transparently disclose their safety and security practices (their Responsible Scaling Policy, or RSP, and its execution), including how they\u2019re using interpretability to test models before release, would allow companies to learn from each other while also making clear who is behaving more responsibly, fostering a \u201crace to the top\u201d.  We\u2019ve suggested safety/security/RSP transparency as a possible direction for California law in our response to the California frontier model task force (which itself mentions some of the same ideas).  This concept could also be exported federally, or to other countries.\r\n\r\nThird, governments can use export controls to create a \u201csecurity buffer\u201d that might give interpretability more time to advance before we reach the most powerful AI.  I\u2019ve long been a proponent of export controls on chips to China because I believe that democratic countries must remain ahead of autocracies in AI.  But these policies also have an additional benefit.  If the US and other democracies have a clear lead in AI as they approach the \u201ccountry of geniuses in a datacenter\u201d, we may be able to \u201cspend\u201d a portion of that lead to ensure interpretability10 is on a more solid footing before proceeding to truly powerful AI, while still defeating our authoritarian adversaries11.  Even a 1- or 2-year lead, which I believe effective and well-enforced export controls can give us, could mean the difference between an \u201cAI MRI\u201d that essentially works when we reach transformative capability levels, and one that does not.  One year ago we couldn\u2019t trace the thoughts of a neural network and couldn\u2019t identify millions of concepts inside them; today we can.  By contrast, if the US and China reach powerful AI simultaneously (which is what I expect to happen without export controls), the geopolitical incentives will make any slowdown at all essentially impossible.\r\n\r\nAll of these\u2014accelerating interpretability, light-touch transparency legislation, and export controls on chips to China\u2014have the virtue of being good ideas in their own right, with few meaningful downsides.  We should do all of them anyway.  But they become even more important when we realize that they might make the difference between interpretability being solved before powerful AI or after it.\r\n\r\nPowerful AI will shape humanity\u2019s destiny, and we deserve to understand our own creations before they radically transform our economy, our lives, and our future.\r\n\r\nThanks to Tom McGrath, Martin Wattenberg, Chris Olah, Ben Buchanan, and many people within Anthropic for feedback on drafts of this article.\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n1 In the case of a plant, this would be water, sunlight, a trellis pointing them in a certain direction, choosing the species of plant, etc.  These things dictate roughly where the plant grows, but its exact shape and growth pattern are impossible to predict, and hard to explain even after they\u2019ve grown.  In the case of AI systems, we can set the basic architecture (usually some variant of the Transformer), the broad type of data they receive, and the high-level algorithm used to train them, but the model\u2019s actual cognitive mechanisms emerge organically from these ingredients, and our understanding of them is poor.  In fact, there are many examples, in both the natural and artificial worlds, of systems we understand (and sometimes control) at the level of principles but not in detail: economies, snowflakes, cellular automata, human evolution, human brain development, and so on.\u21a9\r\n2 You can of course try to detect these risks by simply interacting with the models, and we do this in practice.  But because deceit is precisely the behavior we\u2019re trying to find, external behavior is not reliable.  It\u2019s a bit like trying to determine if someone is a terrorist by asking them if they are a terrorist\u2014not necessarily useless, and you can learn things by how they answer and what they say, but very obviously unreliable.\u21a9\r\n3 I\u2019ll probably describe this in more detail in a future essay, but there are a lot of experiments (many of which were done by Anthropic) showing that models can lie or deceive under certain circumstances when their training is guided in a somewhat artificial way.  There is also evidence of real-world behavior that looks vaguely like \u201ccheating on the test\u201d, though it\u2019s more degenerate than it is dangerous or harmful.  What there isn\u2019t is evidence of dangerous behaviors emerging in a more naturalistic way, or of a general tendency or general intent to lie and deceive for the purposes of gaining power over the world.  It is the latter point where seeing inside the models could help a lot.\u21a9\r\n4 At least in the case of API-served models.  Open-weights models present additional dangers in that guardrails can be simply stripped away.\u21a9\r\n5 Very briefly, there are two ways in which you might expect interpretability to intersect with concerns about AI sentience and welfare.  Firstly, while philosophy of mind is a complex and contentious topic, philosophers will no doubt benefit from a detailed accounting of what actually is occurring in AI models. If we believe them to be superficial pattern-matchers, it seems unlikely they warrant moral consideration. If we find that the computation they perform is similar to the brains of animals, or even humans, that might be evidence in favor of moral consideration.  Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, is the role interpretability would have if we ever concluded that the moral \u201cpatienthood\u201d of AI models was plausible enough to warrant action.  A serious moral accounting on AI can't trust their self-reports, since we might accidentally train them to pretend to be okay when they aren't.  Interpretability would have a crucial role in determining the wellbeing of AIs in such a situation.  (There are, in fact, already some mildly concerning signs from this perspective.)\u21a9\r\n6 For example, the idea of somehow breaking down and understanding the computations happening inside artificial neural networks was probably around in a vague sense since neural networks were invented over 70 years ago, and various efforts to understand why a neural net behaved in a specific way have existed for nearly as long.  But Chris was unusual in proposing and seriously pursuing a comprehensive effort to understand everything they do.\u21a9\r\n7 The basic idea of superposition was described by Arora et al. in 2016, and more generally traces back to classical mathematical work on compressed sensing.  The hypothesis that it explained uninterpretable neurons goes back to early mechanistic interpretability work on vision models.  What changed at this time was that it became clear this was going to be a central problem for language models, much worse than in vision.  We were able to provide a strong theoretical basis for having conviction that superposition was the right hypothesis to pursue.\u21a9\r\n8 One way to say this is that interpretability should function like the test set for model alignment, while traditional alignment techniques such as scalable supervision, RLHF, constitutional AI, etc. should function as the training set.  That is, interpretability acts as an independent check on the alignment of models, uncontaminated by the training process which might incentivize models to appear aligned without being so.  Two consequences of this view are that (a) we should be very hesitant to directly train or optimize on interpretability outputs (features/concepts, circuits) in production, as this destroys the independence of their signal, and (b) it\u2019s important not to \u201cuse\u201d the diagnostic test signal too many times in one production run to inform changes to the training process, as this gradually leaks bits of information about the independent test signal to the training process (though much more slowly than (a)).  In other words, we recommend that in assessing official, high-stakes production models, we treat interpretability analysis with the same care we would treat a hidden evaluation or test set.\u21a9\r\n9 Bizarrely, mechanistic interpretability sometimes seems to meet substantial cultural resistance in academia.  For example, I am concerned by reports that a very popular mechanistic interpretability ICML conference workshop was rejected on seemingly pretextual grounds.  If true, this behavior is shortsighted and self-defeating at exactly a time when academics in AI are looking for ways to maintain relevance.\u21a9\r\n10 Along with other techniques for mitigating risk, of course\u2014I don\u2019t intend to imply that interpretability is our only risk mitigation tool.\u21a9\r\n11 I am in fact quite skeptical that any slowdown to address risk is possible even among companies within democratic countries, given the incredible economic value of AI.  Fighting the market head-on like this feels like trying to stop a freight train with your toe.  But if truly compelling evidence of the dangers of autonomous AI emerged, I think it would be just barely possible.  Contrary to the claims of advocates, I don\u2019t think truly compelling evidence exists today, and I actually think the most likely route for providing \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence of danger is interpretability itself\u2014yet another reason to invest in it!\u21a9\r\nBack to top\r\nPrivacy policy"

            "because this The startup Anthropic is one of the most talked about AI companies in the world; its recent valuation was $61.5 billion. In an essay by its CEO Dario Amodei, he wrote, \u201cPeople outside the field are often surprised and alarmed to learn that we do not understand how our own AI creations work. They are right to be concerned: this lack of understanding is essentially unprecedented in the history of technology.\u201d He noted this is increasing the risk of unintended and potentially harmful outcomes. And, he argued the industry should turn its attention to so-called \u201cinterpretability\u201d before AI advances to the point where it becomes an impossible feat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese systems will be absolutely central to the economy, technology, and national security, and will be capable of so much autonomy that I consider it basically unacceptable for humanity to be totally ignorant of how they work,\u201d Amodei wrote in the essay.\r\n\r\nAmodei said that, unlike traditional software which is explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, no one truly understands why AI systems make the decisions they do when generating an output. Recently, OpenAI admitted that \u201cmore research is needed\u201d to understand why its o3 and o4-mini models are hallucinating more than previous iterations.\r\n\r\nSEE: Anthropic\u2019s Generative AI Research Reveals More About How LLMs Affect Security and Bias\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like growing a plant or a bacterial colony: we set the high-level conditions that direct and shape growth,\u201d Amodei wrote. \u201cBut the exact structure which emerges is unpredictable and difficult to understand or explain.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is the root of all concerns about AI\u2019s safety, Amodei went on. If we understood what it was doing, we could anticipate harmful behaviours and confidently design systems to prevent them, such as systematically blocking jailbreaks that would allow users to access information about biological or cyber weapons. It would also fundamentally prevent AI from ever deceiving humans or becoming uncontrollably powerful.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the startup\u2019s CEO has been vocal about his concern about the general lack of AI understanding. Speaking in November, he said that while \u201cpeople laugh today when chatbots say something a little unpredictable,\u201d it highlights the importance of controlling AI before it develops more nefarious capabilities.\r\n\r\nMore must-read AI coverage\r\n6.4B OpenAI Deal Brings Onboard \u2018Greatest Designer\u2019 & Apple Icon Jony Ive\r\nNew Google Search AI Mode is \u2018Total Reimagining,\u2019 Says CEO Sundar Pichai\r\nForget Prompt Engineering: Companies Are Now Hiring These AI Specialists\r\nShark Tank\u2019s Mr. Wonderful is Building the World\u2019s Largest AI Data Center in Canada\r\nDevelopers Beware: Slopsquatting & Vibe Coding Can Increase Risk of AI-Powered Attacks\r\nAnthropic has been working on model interpretability for some time\r\nAmodei said that Anthropic and other industry players have been working on opening AI\u2019s black box for several years. The ultimate goal is to create \u201cthe analogue of a highly precise and accurate MRI that would fully reveal the inner workings of an AI model, identifying issues like a model\u2019s tendency to lie and flaws in jailbreaks.\u201d\r\n\r\nEarly on in the research, Amodei and others identified neurons inside the models that could be directly mapped to single, human-understandable concepts. However, the vast majority were \u201can incoherent pastiche of many different words and concepts,\u201d blocking progress.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe model uses superposition because this allows it to express more concepts than it has neurons, enabling it to learn more,\u201d Amodei wrote. Eventually, researchers discovered that they could use signal processing to correspond certain neuron combinations to human-understandable concepts.\r\n\r\nSEE: UK\u2019s International AI Safety Report Shows Progress is at Breakneck Speed\r\n\r\nThese concepts were dubbed \u201cfeatures,\u201d and Amodei said they can have their importance increased or decreased inside a neural network, giving AI researchers a degree of control. About 30 million features have been mapped so far, but Amodei says this likely represents just a fraction of the number found inside even a small model.\r\n\r\nNow, researchers are tracking and manipulating groups of features called \u201ccircuits,\u201d which provide deeper insight into how a model creates concepts from input words and how they lead to its output. Amodei predicts the \u201cMRI for AI\u201d will be here in five to 10 years.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, I worry that AI itself is advancing so quickly that we might not have even this much time,\u201d he wrote.\r\n\r\nThree steps to interpretability\r\nThe Anthropic CEO outlined three things that can be done to achieve interpretability sooner:\r\n\r\nResearchers need to directly work on model interpretability. He urged the likes of Google, DeepMind, and OpenAI to allocate more resources to the effort, and even encouraged neuroscientists to transition into AI.\r\nGovernments should require companies to disclose how they\u2019re using interpretability in AI testing. Amodei is clear that he does not want regulation to prevent progress, but admits that this requirement would boost shared knowledge and incentivise companies to behave responsibly.\r\nGovernments should use export controls to help democracies lead in AI and \u201cspend\u201d that lead on safeguarding interpretability. Amodei trusts that democratic nations would accept slower progress to ensure safety, while autocracies, like China, may not."
