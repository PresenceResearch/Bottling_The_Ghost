And right now, the current tax on Chinese \nL231: imports \u3010104\u2020could go as high as 125 percent\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011.\nL232: \nL233: Unfortunately, some retailers and manufacturers are taking advantage of the \nL234: situation with subtle tricks to get you buying less-than-worthwhile models. \nL235: Here\u2019s what you need to avoid and what you should do instead if you need to buy \nL236: a laptop before tariff price bumps kick in.\nL237: \nL238: ## Trick #1: Suspiciously good sale prices \nL239: \nL240: The best-selling laptop on Amazon right now is an unspecified Lenovo IdeaPad \nL241: that\u2019s being sold by a third-party seller named AZXUT STORE\u2014and this product \nL242: listing is highly suspicious.\nL243: \nL244: \u3010105\u2020It first appeared on Amazon in early April\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011 at a price\nL245:  of $1,499, then was cut down to $399. It has since increased to $429, meaning \nL246: the laptop is listed as \u201c71% off.\u201d It\u2019s also labeled as the \u201c#1 Best Seller\u201d in \nL247: the Traditional Laptop Computers category. It even lists 32GB of memory and a \nL248: 1TB solid state drive. With all that, I can\u2019t blame anyone who bought this over \nL249: the past few days. It looks like a killer deal. But it isn\u2019t.\nL250: \nL251: [Image 1: Lenovo IdeaPad laptop suspicious sale pricing on Amazon product \nL252: listing]\nL253: \nL254: Matt Smith / Foundry \nL255: \nL256: The first sign that something\u2019s fishy is the processor. The listing claims that \nL257: this laptop has an Intel Celeron N4500, a dual-core processor that released in \nL258: 2021. The Celeron N4500 was among the slowest processors produced by Intel at \nL259: the time, and today its performance is truly abysmal. According to Geekbench 6, \nL260: a typical laptop with a Celeron N4500 \u3010106\u2020hits a multi-core score of \nL261: 731\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 120U\u2014a modern chip \nL262: found in many budget laptops\u2014\u3010107\u2020typically scores about \nL263: 7,500\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011.\nL264: \nL265: To me, this stinks of a scam that\u2019s preying on less knowledgeable folk. The \nL266: seller, AZXUT STORE, has many recent 1-star reviews. Some customers say the \nL267: products they received were used, that they didn\u2019t match their respective \nL268: listings, or that they received nothing at all.\nL269: \nL270: I couldn\u2019t find contact information for AZXUT STORE, and the contact button on \nL271: Amazon\u2019s website directed me to a chatbot. I\u2019ve reached out to Amazon for \nL272: comment on the situation.\nL273: \nL274: ## Trick #2: Deceptive marketing claims \nL275: \nL276: The #1 best-selling laptop on Amazon is plenty suspicious, but it isn\u2019t the only\nL277:  way sellers are looking to pull one over on shoppers. Some are trying to trick \nL278: buyers by misrepresenting what a laptop can do.\nL279: \nL280: Gaming laptops are a particularly deep reservoir of terrible listings. A search \nL281: for \u201cgaming laptop\u201d on Amazon will surface comically terrible laptops like the \nL282: \u3010108\u2020ACEMAGIC AX16PRO\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011, \u3010109\u2020NIMO N155\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011, and the\u2026 \nL283: uh\u2026 \u201c\u3010110\u2020Gaming Laptop, Laptop Computer, Computer Laptop\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011.\u201d\nL284: \nL285: [Image 2: Deceptive gaming laptop product listings on Amazon search results]\nL286: \nL287: Matt Smith / Foundry \nL288: \nL289: The ACEMAGIC, being sold by a company called SMART DEALS WAREHOUSE, is guilty of\nL290:  the first trick mentioned above with a very high listed price of $1,600 that\u2019s \nL291: discounted down to $500. But it pours salt on the wound with a second trick: it \nL292: misrepresents itself as a gaming laptop. The listing claims it\u2019s an \u201cACEMAGIC \nL293: 2025 Gaming Laptop\u201d and uses generic marketing images with attractive anime \nL294: characters and race cars, with particular focus on the laptop\u2019s AMD Radeon Vega \nL295: 8 graphics.\nL296: \nL297: As you probably already know, the Vega 8 is the integrated graphics solution \nL298: included with many AMD Ryzen chips. Not only is it an iGPU, it\u2019s not even the \nL299: latest iGPU. The Ryzen 5700U on this laptop was launched back in 2021, so its \nL300: equipped Radeon integrated graphics are a couple generations behind the latest \nL301: hardware.\nL302: \nL303: \u3010111\u2020PC World\u2019s review of the HP Envy x360\u3011, a laptop with the same Ryzen 5700U \nL304: and Radeon Vega 8 graphics, found it achieved a 3Dmark Time Spy score of roughly\nL305:  1,500. Laptops with the latest integrated graphics from Intel and AMD tend to \nL306: score at least 3,000 in that test.\nL307: \nL308: Can the ACEMAGIC laptop load and play a PC game? Sure. But the experience isn\u2019t \nL309: going to be any better than what you can get with any other budget or mid-range \nL310: laptop with integrated graphics.\nL311: \nL312: ## Trick #3: High-pressure sales tactics \nL313: \nL314: Vaio, the remnant of the Sony Vaio brand (which Sony sold years ago), was quick \nL315: to take advantage of the April tariff announcement. The company swiftly sent out\nL316:  a marketing email \u3010112\u2020that urged shoppers to buy a laptop now at \u201ctariff-free\u201d\nL317:  prices\u3011 before the tariffs went into effect.\nL318: \nL319: This trick is a bit less shady than the first two. The laptops that Vaio linked \nL320: to in the email were no different than the laptops they usually offer, nor did \nL321: they have marked-up prices or ancient hardware. Still, the email was an obvious \nL322: scare tactic meant to push consumers into making panic buys, which could lead \nL323: shoppers into buyer\u2019s remorse.\nL324: \nL325: [Image 3: Example Vaio FS 16 laptop being sold on Costco listing]\nL326: \nL327: Matt Smith / Foundry \nL328: \nL329: Vaio laptops don\u2019t have a strong presence in the United States. While there\u2019s \nL330: nothing wrong with the configurations they offer, Vaio laptops are pretty \nL331: unremarkable. And I\u2019d say they\u2019re on the pricey side, too. A laptop like the \nL332: Vaio FS\u2014\u3010113\u2020sold for $1,099.99 online via Costco\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011\u2014is a \nL333: decent laptop, but if you had the chance to look into similar machines, you\u2019d \nL334: likely find a better deal\u2026 like, say, the \u3010114\u2020Asus Vivobook S 16 Flip for \nL335: $1,069\u2020click.linksynergy.com\u3011.\nL336: \nL337: Vaio is hardly alone. I\u2019ve received several marketing emails from other \nL338: companies in the past few days that play up these fears. Plus, Vaio laptops are \nL339: advertised as \u201cproudly manufactured in Japan,\u201d which is funny since it means \nL340: Vaio laptops won\u2019t be subject to the steepest tariffs. In that sense, US tariffs\nL341:  on China could work out well for Vaio in the long run. But that also means \nL342: there isn\u2019t as much pressure to buy a Vaio ASAP.\nL343: \nL344: ## If you need to buy a laptop now, do this \nL345: \nL346: You now know three common tricks that retailers and manufacturers are trying to \nL347: pull to get you buying a laptop now. But knowing these tricks only tells you \nL348: what you need to avoid. What should you actually look for? It\u2019s obviously a \nL349: complex topic, but I have some simple advice.\nL350: \nL351: First, identify what CPU (and GPU, if applicable) the laptop has. If you can\u2019t \nL352: find that information in the listing, don\u2019t buy it.\nL353: \nL354: Then, once you know the CPU (and/or GPU), pull up your favorite search engine \nL355: and search for that exact CPU (and/or GPU) to find the date it was released. \nL356: You\u2019ll want a CPU that launched in the last year or two, and a GPU that launched\nL357:  in the last three years. If the CPU and/or GPU in the laptop you\u2019re eyeing is \nL358: older than those thresholds, yet the retailer is claiming that the laptop is ","summary":"Buying a laptop before China tariffs kick in?

If the CPU and/or GPU in the laptop you\u2019re eyeing is \nL358: older than those thresholds, yet the retailer is claiming that the laptop is \nL359: \u201cnew,\u201d then don\u2019t buy it.\nL360: \nL361: For more guidance on how to buy a good budget laptop without being cheated or \nL362: swindled, see our articles on \u3010115\u2020minimum specs for a budget laptop\u3011 and \nL363: \u3010116\u2020what a $500 laptop looks like these days\u3011.

These 2-in-1 \nL390: laptops are less portable than 14-inch machines yet still have good battery \nL391: life. The more expensive models are speedy, too.

Recommended Chinese Notebooks 2019\nL187: \nL188: [Image 0]\nL189: \nL190: [Image 1: Recommended Chinese Notebooks 2019] \nL191: \nL192: Just like my \u301015\u2020recommended tablet list\u3011, these are laptops I have owned, \nL193: tested and reviewed that come recommended by me. Since it\u2019s 2019 I don\u2019t \nL194: recommend anyone buy laptops powered by the older Apollo Lake chipset\u2019s they are\nL195:  around 15-20% slower than the newer Gemini Lake don\u2019t have DDR4 support or HDMI\nL196:  2.0. The latest generation of laptops are not only better built (Some with full\nL197:  metal designs) But with options such as 2280 M.2 SSD slots, they have the \nL198: faster Gemini Lake series of chips powering with better GPU\u2019s, faster turbo \nL199: clock speeds, native VP9, and HEVC decoding (since the Apollo Lake) and all \nL200: support Intel Wireless AC with BT 5.0.\nL201: \nL202: The Gemini Lake Celeron N4100 chipset is good for light tasks, such as editing \nL203: docs, multi-tabs in Chrome, and Edge with many tabs open. Some light \nL204: multitasking and older or light games such as Counter-Strike at 720p and League \nL205: of Legends on low visual settings 1080p run okay. They are not good for video \nL206: editing, heavy gaming, and any demanding 3D work. One of the best features of \nL207: the Gemini Lake & is the great battery life of up to 8 hours and in some cases \nL208: even more and of course their price. Most Gemini Lake laptops have HDMI 2.0A 4k \nL209: 60hz support and are completely fanless.\nL210: \nL211: And they make ideal for first notebooks, great for students, light school work \nL212: and secondary cheaper travel notebooks where someone already has a powerful PC \nL213: for heavy tasks like gaming and video editing.\nL214: \nL215: ## Recommended Gemini Lake Powered Laptops:\nL216: \nL217: #1 BMAX Y13:\nL218: \nL219: The BMAX Y13 is currently my favorite for the build, a good backlit keyboard but\nL220:  harder to see keycaps due to the colour. However, the fully laminated IPS \nL221: screen (74% Adobe RGB) supports touch with great touch response and touch \nL222: accuracy.

Despite its long-term reputation for making affordable, budget \nL140: laptops, the company currently has one of the widest selections of models, with \nL141: multiple laptop lineups like the productivity-focused Aspire and Swift, the \nL142: gaming Nitro and Predator lines, the creation-geared Concept lineup, and more. \nL143: Acer is also one of the biggest Chromebook manufacturers, producing popular \nL144: models like the \u301057\u2020Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (2020)\u3011 and even gaming Chromebooks\nL145:  like the \u301058\u2020Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE (2024)\u3011.\nL146: \nL147: The best Acer laptop we've tested is the Acer Swift Go 14 (2024), a 14-inch \nL148: ultraportable.

The keyboard feels \nL153: spacious, albeit slightly mushy, and the touchpad is large and responsive.

Although\nL641:  it has made computer peripherals since the 1980s, its Surface line of personal \nL642: computers is relatively young, with the first device released back in 2012. \nL643: Microsoft has popularized the 2-in-1 tablet form factor with its Surface Pros, \nL644: and it often makes devices with unique features, like the Surface Laptop's \nL645: Alcantara-covered keyboard deck and the Surface Book's detachable display. \nL646: Microsoft has a fairly small lineup, focusing almost solely on productivity and \nL647: media consumption devices. Its laptops are usually well-built and provide a \nL648: great user experience, but they're more expensive than similar models from other\nL649:  brands.\nL650: \nL651: The best Microsoft laptop we've tested is the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th \nL652: Edition 15 (2024). After six generations of the Surface Laptop, Microsoft has \nL653: finally given this latest model some sorely needed changes, including a more \nL654: compact design with slimmer bezels, a brighter 120Hz display with full DCI P3 \nL655: coverage, a haptic touchpad, a wider port selection, and a higher-resolution \nL656: webcam. This model is also a huge departure from its predecessors, as it now \nL657: sports an ARM-based SoC, the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite. This chip performs \nL658: well and is incredibly efficient, resulting in a whopping 17-hour battery life \nL659: in light uses. That said, not all programs will work or run properly on this new\nL660:  platform, so check that the apps you use are compatible first.\nL661: \nL662: Another Microsoft device worth mentioning is the \u301077\u2020Microsoft Surface Pro 11th \nL663: Edition (2024)\u3011. There are also changes on this model compared to older \nL664: generations of the Surface Pros, including the adoption of Qualcomm's Snapdragon\nL665:  X Plus and X Elite SoCs, an OLED display option, a 1440p webcam, Wi-Fi 7, and a\nL666:  new type cover with a haptic touchpad. The latter is now Bluetooth-enabled, \nL667: allowing you to use the type cover keyboard even when detached from the device. \nL668: Unfortunately, the keyboard and stylus are still separate purchases, and they \nL669: aren't exactly cheap, making this tablet PC very expensive with everything \nL670: combined.\nL671: \nL672: \u301038\u2020See our review \u3011 \nL673: \nL674: ## Recent Updates\nL675: \nL676:   1.

Direct from \u301044\u2020Chuwi\u2020store.chuwi.com\u3011\nL270: \nL271: Something is odd about the availability of the CoreBook X that makes me wonder \nL272: if it\u2019s a limited run, possibly using a limited supply of the older Intel \nL273: processors that have been made available.\nL274: \nL275: While most Chuwi models appear on all the regional Chuwi sites and on Amazon in \nL276: most regions, the CoreBook X is only available on the global outlet.\nL277: \nL278: There are currently four CoreBook X SKUs, with one using the i3-1220P CPU, two \nL279: using the i5-12450H, and one using the i5-1235U.\nL280: \nL281: The two i5-1245H models are a standard CoreBook X that\u2019s the review hardware, \nL282: and Chuwi also makes a CoreBook XPro option with an even bigger 15.6-inch \nL283: display, and slightly more battery capacity.\nL284: \nL285: The i3 model starts at $369, and the i5-12450 is $399 in the USA. They are \nL286: \u20ac357.20 and \u20ac386.24 in Europe and \u00a3297.51 or \u00a3321.69 in the UK.\nL287: \nL288: For those interested, the CoreBook XPro is $429/\u20ac415.28/\u00a3345.88, and I couldn\u2019t \nL289: find the i5-1235U model in the Chuwi store.\nL290: \nL291: Typically, Intel Core i5 laptops start at around $500, like the Acer Aspire 5 15\nL292:  Slim Laptop. But these can use DDR5 memory, have USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and \nL293: biometrics.\nL294: \nL295: There is a reason the CoreBook X is so cheap, and this factor impacts the \nL296: usability of this equipment.

What\u2019s slightly odd about \nL387: the chosen panel is that it\u2019s not as saturated as some IPS displays I\u2019ve seen, \nL388: and at the higher brightness settings, it can appear a little washed out. And, \nL389: because of the aspect, watching TV or file content results in large black bars \nL390: at the top and bottom of the presentation.\nL391: \nL392: The keyboard uses the full width of the laptop, although it doesn\u2019t manage to \nL393: find room for a numeric pad, and the touchpad is one of those unfortunate \nL394: flexible click varieties. I wasn\u2019t expecting much from either, but the keyboard \nL395: works well enough.\nL396: \nL397: If possible, I would like to see inside laptops to determine what upgrade \nL398: options are available.\nL399: \nL400: That was a more complicated exercise than it initially looked, even if you can \nL401: get to the unused SODIMM memory slot merely by removing a plate held in place by\nL402:  two screws.\nL403: \nL404: [Image 22: Chuwi CoreBook X]\nL405: \nL406: (Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\nL407: \nL408: To remove the underside involves nine visible screws, one of which was \nL409: underneath a QA sticker.

In fact, \nL227: most people don\u2019t need to spend much at all. Whether you\u2019re on a budget or \nL228: you\u2019re buying for a student or child, sometimes the best laptop is the one \nL229: that\u2019s most affordable. \nL230: \nL231: But just because you\u2019re spending less doesn\u2019t mean you should settle for less. \nL232: To make sure your laptop won\u2019t leave you frustrated and pulling your hair out, \nL233: there are a few key specs that you shouldn\u2019t compromise on\u2014or else you\u2019ll \nL234: probably regret your purchase.\nL235: \nL236: What counts as a budget laptop? In this case, we\u2019re aiming for a price around \nL237: $500 and we\u2019re using \u3010104\u2020PCWorld\u2019s best budget laptop picks\u3011 to get a sense of \nL238: what\u2019s possible, what\u2019s reasonable, and what\u2019s non-negotiable. Just be aware \nL239: that you\u2019ll give up some luxuries (like a dedicated graphics card) at this price\nL240:  point, but you\u2019ll end up with a great daily driver laptop for work, school, and\nL241:  everyday activities.\nL242: \nL243: That said, let\u2019s dive into the most important specs for a budget laptop and the \nL244: absolute minimum acceptable for each one.\nL245: \nL246: > Further reading: \u3010105\u2020Buying a laptop before China tariffs kick in? Don\u2019t fall\nL247:  for these tricks\u3011\nL248: \nL249: ## Operating system\nL250: \nL251: [Image 2: best buy chromebook sale]\nL252: \nL253: Asus, Samsung, Lenovo \nL254: \nL255: The very first choice you must make is the operating system. And if you\u2019re on a \nL256: budget, you really only have two options: Windows or ChromeOS. (You could also \nL257: run Linux if you\u2019re tech-savvy enough, but if you know enough to run Linux, you \nL258: likely don\u2019t need this article.)\nL259: \nL260: Windows is the de facto choice because it\u2019s used everywhere, everyone is \nL261: familiar with it, and most apps \u201cjust work\u201d on Windows computers. But it has a \nL262: lot of system overhead so it doesn\u2019t run as well on low-end hardware and you \nL263: might experience subpar performance.\nL264: \nL265: ChromeOS, which is the operating system for Chromebooks, is far more restricted \nL266: in what apps it can run. If it isn\u2019t available in the Chrome Web Store, you\u2019re \nL267: pretty much out of luck. (Sure, you can use workarounds like remote desktop-ing \nL268: into a separate Windows machine, but that kind of defeats the point of buying a \nL269: budget laptop!)\nL270: \nL271: That said, there are \u3010106\u2020plenty of good reasons to buy a Chromebook over a \nL272: laptop\u3011, like the bang-for-your-buck on performance and price, so don\u2019t be \nL273: turned off. Chromebooks are quite good these days.\nL274: \nL275: Note: If you\u2019re buying a laptop for a student, you should definitely check with \nL276: their school first because some schools have mandatory OS requirements. Even if \nL277: they don\u2019t, they might have specific software needs\u2014and if that software isn\u2019t \nL278: available on ChromeOS, you\u2019ll have to go with Windows.\nL279: \nL280: What about MacBooks? While it\u2019s possible to buy a MacBook on a budget, you\u2019ll \nL281: have to give up a lot in the process\u2014or stretch your definition of \u201cbudget.\u201d \nL282: Even the cheapest MacBooks far exceed $500, and they tend to be older discounted\nL283:  models. Generally speaking, Macs aren\u2019t great for getting the best specs for \nL284: your money.\nL285: \nL286: ## RAM\nL287: \nL288: [Image 3: Framework Laptop taken apart with parts ordered neatly]\nL289: \nL290: Framework \nL291: \nL292: You can think of RAM like the amount of workspace you have on your desk: more \nL293: RAM means more space to concurrently run apps and keep numerous files open, \nL294: allowing you to jump between and multitask without having to close and re-open \nL295: stuff all the time.\nL296: \nL297: That\u2019s why RAM is key to laptop performance, and it\u2019s important to get a laptop \nL298: that has enough RAM to run smoothly. I recommend a minimum 8GB of RAM, but bump \nL299: it up to 16GB if you want to \u201cfuture proof\u201d against growing needs in the future.\nL300: \nL301: The good news is, finding solid laptops with at least 8GB of RAM isn\u2019t \nL302: difficult\u2014but if your budget is limited to around $300, you\u2019re likely to be \nL303: stuck with 4GB options at best. If you can afford it, it\u2019s definitely worth the \nL304: extra cash to hit 8GB, even on Chromebooks. Otherwise, you\u2019ll find that your \nL305: laptop\u2019s sluggishness will affect your enjoyment of it.\nL306: \nL307: ## CPU\nL308: \nL309: [Image 4: Der CPU-Prozessor-Chip \u00fcberhitzt und brennt im Sockel auf der \nL310: Hauptplatine des Computers]\nL311: \nL312: BLKstudio / Shutterstock.com \nL313: \nL314: When it comes to CPUs on budget laptops, you have to temper your expectations. \nL315: You won\u2019t be able to get anything truly powerful, but you will be able to find \nL316: something that suits your needs and gets you through non-intensive tasks like \nL317: office work, studying, and watching videos.\nL318: \nL319: Among the more affordable Windows laptops, Intel i3 and i5 processors are the \nL320: most common options. Ideally you should opt for the i5, but you can settle for \nL321: an i3 if you\u2019re on a tight budget; it should keep up with regular tasks as long \nL322: as you pair it with at least 8GB of RAM. AMD Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 5 processors are \nL323: also frequently seen in budget-tier laptops, and they can save you a little more\nL324:  money than their Intel alternatives.\nL325: \nL326: In Chromebooks, you\u2019ll mostly find Intel i3 and i5 processors along with \nL327: MediaTek options. MediaTek processors are typically found in budget phones \nL328: because they have better battery life, but they have the disadvantage of being \nL329: less powerful.\nL330: \nL331: Either way, opt for Intel or AMD if you care about performance. Just don\u2019t \nL332: expect any high-end gaming! You\u2019d need a dedicated GPU for that, and that\u2019s not \nL333: happening in a budget laptop.\nL334: \nL335: ## Battery life\nL336: \nL337: [Image 5: laptop battery level indicator]\nL338: \nL339: Panos Sakalakis / Unsplash \nL340: \nL341: You have lots of options when it comes to battery life, even in the affordable \nL342: laptop territory. Not only do weaker processors give you longer staying power, \nL343: but larger batteries can help too\u2014if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice weight and \nL344: portability.\nL345: \nL346: And here, too, is an area where your choice of OS matters. Generally speaking, \nL347: Chromebooks usually last longer on a single charge than an equivalent Windows \nL348: laptop.\nL349: \nL350: If you travel frequently or simply prefer to use your laptop unplugged, then aim\nL351:  for one that promises 10 to 12 hours of battery life. Most manufacturers \nL352: overpromise and under deliver, so it\u2019s quite possible you\u2019ll only get around 8 \nL353: hours despite their claims. Still, 8 hours of battery life on a laptop should be\nL354:  enough to last a workday or a school day, all while letting you live \nL355: comfortably untethered. \nL356: \nL357: If in doubt about a particular laptop, check if PCWorld has reviewed it\u2014\u3010107\u2020we \nL358: run battery tests\u3011 to confirm if laptops live up to their promises.","summary":"Buying a budget laptop?

Jacobi \nL365: \nL366: Sticking to a budget means cutting some corners, and storage space is usually \nL367: among the first areas hit by compromise. That can be a problem if you aren\u2019t \nL368: careful, though.\nL369: \nL370: For the best laptop experience, you\u2019ll want ample storage and you\u2019ll want it to \nL371: be fast. A slow hard drive with inadequate capacity will leave you micromanaging\nL372:  your files and apps as well as waiting inordinately long for files and apps to \nL373: load.\nL374: \nL375: Among good budget options, you\u2019ll find storage options ranging from 64GB to \nL376: 256GB. Obviously, more is better, but if you\u2019re on Windows, you shouldn\u2019t dip \nL377: below 128GB at the very least. (The operating system alone will take up around \nL378: 30GB, and modern apps are space hogs on top.) Anything less than 128GB and \nL379: you\u2019ll find yourself running out of space so often that you\u2019ll be tearing out \nL380: your hair.\nL381: \nL382: Chromebooks, on the other hand, can survive pretty well on 64GB of storage for \nL383: several reasons: the OS doesn\u2019t take up as much space, Chromebook apps are \nL384: typically smaller, and ChromeOS relies more on cloud storage than local storage.\nL385:  The downside is that you basically need 24/7 internet access for day-to-day \nL386: use.\nL387: \nL388: > Note: If you have to settle for a laptop with inadequate storage space, you \nL389: can always add an external drive to expand capacity. Just make sure the laptop \nL390: you get has enough ports for it (addressed later in this article), and stick to \nL391: \u3010108\u2020our picks for best external drives\u3011.\nL392: \nL393: ## Storage types\nL394: \nL395: [Image 7: Verschiedene Arten von SSD-Festplattenlaufwerken einzeln auf Laptop-\nL396: Tastatur]\nL397: \nL398: Maxx-Studio / Shutterstock.com \nL399: \nL400: Modern Windows laptops come with two primary options: SSD or eMMC. Don\u2019t settle \nL401: for anything less than an SSD. Some cheaper laptops may offer eMMC drives, but \nL402: eMMC drives run very slow and fill up faster due to their smaller capacities. \nL403: You\u2019ll be frustrated, trust me.\nL404: \nL405: Chromebooks, however, tend to come with three options: SSD, eMMC, and UFS. \nL406: Again, I don\u2019t recommend eMMC drives for the same reasons, but UFS is worth \nL407: considering. Universal Flash Storage is \u201cnewer\u201d and more typically found on \nL408: mobile devices, but since ChromeOS is a mobile-like operating system, it\u2019s well-\nL409: suited to run on UFS.\nL410: \nL411: In general, UFS is faster than eMMC but slower than an SSD. If you want the best\nL412:  speeds, an SSD is still the best (but most expensive) option. If your goal is \nL413: to save money, you\u2019ll do fine with a UFS drive.\nL414: \nL415: ## Display resolution\nL416: \nL417: [Image 8: Windows 11 mit dem neuen Bing Copilot direkt in das OS integriert.]\nL418: \nL419: guteksk7 / Shutterstock.com \nL420: \nL421: At cheaper tiers, laptops mainly come with 720p or 1080p resolutions. I only saw\nL422:  one laptop featuring a higher resolution, but that came at the expense of \nL423: cutting other corners.\nL424: \nL425: So, when buying a budget laptop, you\u2019ll want to stick to 1080p unless you\u2019re \nL426: particularly strapped for cash. Going with 720p can save money, but the \nL427: experience is subpar: text is harder to read, video content suffers, and you \nL428: have less screen real estate for apps and files.\nL429: \nL430: Stepping up to 1080p solves all of that, and you\u2019ll appreciate the improved \nL431: resolution if you end up using your laptop to watch Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc.\nL432: \nL433: ## Laptop size\nL434: \nL435: [Image 9: Razer gaming laptop closed with logo on lid hero]\nL436: \nL437: Thiago Trevisan / IDG \nL438: \nL439: The ideal laptop size really depends on your needs.\nL440: \nL441: On the larger end, you have 15-inch and 17-inch laptops that provide bigger \nL442: screens and wider keyboards, but laptops at this size tend to be heavy and \nL443: detract from portability. And be aware that larger laptop screens may sometimes \nL444: have lower resolutions, which can affect crispness of image and the actual \nL445: amount of usable screen real estate. On the flip side, you have smaller 13-inch \nL446: laptops that are lighter and more portable but generally more cramped with \nL447: tighter keyboards.\nL448: \nL449: I find that the sweet spot for portable productivity is with a 13-inch laptop \nL450: that has a 1080p resolution. You get ample screen real estate and crisp images, \nL451: a lightweight body that doesn\u2019t take up much space in a bag, and the price is \nL452: usually quite affordable.\nL453: \nL454: ## Ports and connectivity\nL455: \nL456: [Image 10: External hard drive plugged into side of Windows laptop] \u3010109\u2020Immo \nL457: Wegmann / Unsplash\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011\nL458: \nL459: Ports are important on budget laptops, especially if you\u2019re sacrificing storage \nL460: space and screen size. With the right ports, you have the flexibility to connect\nL461:  external drives and external monitors.\nL462: \nL463: Thankfully, unless you go very low on price, you have good options. If possible,\nL464:  aim for at least one USB-C port and one USB-A port. USB-C has taken over as the\nL465:  dominant connector, but plenty of storage devices and other accessories still \nL466: rely on USB-A.\nL467: \nL468: If you can find a budget laptop with an HDMI port as well, you should consider \nL469: it because it\u2019ll make it easy to connect an external monitor. USB-C can \nL470: theoretically handle monitors as well, but not every USB-C port is built the \nL471: same and capable of supporting the same devices.\nL472: \nL473: > Note: If you have to settle for a laptop with inadequate ports, you can always\nL474:  add extra ports separately with a USB-C hub or docking station. See our picks \nL475: for \u3010110\u2020best USB-C hubs\u3011 and \u3010111\u2020best Thunderbolt docks\u3011.\nL476: \nL477: ## Min specs for budget laptops in a nutshell \nL478: \nL479: Phew, that\u2019s a lot to digest, so here\u2019s a quick summary of my recommended \nL480: minimum specs for budget laptops without all the contextual explanations and \nL481: rationale:\nL482: \nL483:   * RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB if you can afford it.","summary":"Buying a budget laptop?

That can be a problem if you aren\u2019t \nL368: careful, though.\nL369: \nL370: For the best laptop experience, you\u2019ll want ample storage and you\u2019ll want it to \nL371: be fast. A slow hard drive with inadequate capacity will leave you micromanaging\nL372:  your files and apps as well as waiting inordinately long for files and apps to \nL373: load.\nL374: \nL375: Among good budget options, you\u2019ll find storage options ranging from 64GB to \nL376: 256GB. Obviously, more is better, but if you\u2019re on Windows, you shouldn\u2019t dip \nL377: below 128GB at the very least. (The operating system alone will take up around \nL378: 30GB, and modern apps are space hogs on top.) Anything less than 128GB and \nL379: you\u2019ll find yourself running out of space so often that you\u2019ll be tearing out \nL380: your hair.\nL381: \nL382: Chromebooks, on the other hand, can survive pretty well on 64GB of storage for \nL383: several reasons: the OS doesn\u2019t take up as much space, Chromebook apps are \nL384: typically smaller, and ChromeOS relies more on cloud storage than local storage.\nL385:  The downside is that you basically need 24/7 internet access for day-to-day \nL386: use.\nL387: \nL388: > Note: If you have to settle for a laptop with inadequate storage space, you \nL389: can always add an external drive to expand capacity. Just make sure the laptop \nL390: you get has enough ports for it (addressed later in this article), and stick to \nL391: \u3010108\u2020our picks for best external drives\u3011.\nL392: \nL393: ## Storage types\nL394: \nL395: [Image 7: Verschiedene Arten von SSD-Festplattenlaufwerken einzeln auf Laptop-\nL396: Tastatur]\nL397: \nL398: Maxx-Studio / Shutterstock.com \nL399: \nL400: Modern Windows laptops come with two primary options: SSD or eMMC. Don\u2019t settle \nL401: for anything less than an SSD. Some cheaper laptops may offer eMMC drives, but \nL402: eMMC drives run very slow and fill up faster due to their smaller capacities. \nL403: You\u2019ll be frustrated, trust me.\nL404: \nL405: Chromebooks, however, tend to come with three options: SSD, eMMC, and UFS. \nL406: Again, I don\u2019t recommend eMMC drives for the same reasons, but UFS is worth \nL407: considering. Universal Flash Storage is \u201cnewer\u201d and more typically found on \nL408: mobile devices, but since ChromeOS is a mobile-like operating system, it\u2019s well-\nL409: suited to run on UFS.\nL410: \nL411: In general, UFS is faster than eMMC but slower than an SSD. If you want the best\nL412:  speeds, an SSD is still the best (but most expensive) option. If your goal is \nL413: to save money, you\u2019ll do fine with a UFS drive.\nL414: \nL415: ## Display resolution\nL416: \nL417: [Image 8: Windows 11 mit dem neuen Bing Copilot direkt in das OS integriert.]\nL418: \nL419: guteksk7 / Shutterstock.com \nL420: \nL421: At cheaper tiers, laptops mainly come with 720p or 1080p resolutions. I only saw\nL422:  one laptop featuring a higher resolution, but that came at the expense of \nL423: cutting other corners.\nL424: \nL425: So, when buying a budget laptop, you\u2019ll want to stick to 1080p unless you\u2019re \nL426: particularly strapped for cash. Going with 720p can save money, but the \nL427: experience is subpar: text is harder to read, video content suffers, and you \nL428: have less screen real estate for apps and files.\nL429: \nL430: Stepping up to 1080p solves all of that, and you\u2019ll appreciate the improved \nL431: resolution if you end up using your laptop to watch Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc.\nL432: \nL433: ## Laptop size\nL434: \nL435: [Image 9: Razer gaming laptop closed with logo on lid hero]\nL436: \nL437: Thiago Trevisan / IDG \nL438: \nL439: The ideal laptop size really depends on your needs.\nL440: \nL441: On the larger end, you have 15-inch and 17-inch laptops that provide bigger \nL442: screens and wider keyboards, but laptops at this size tend to be heavy and \nL443: detract from portability. And be aware that larger laptop screens may sometimes \nL444: have lower resolutions, which can affect crispness of image and the actual \nL445: amount of usable screen real estate. On the flip side, you have smaller 13-inch \nL446: laptops that are lighter and more portable but generally more cramped with \nL447: tighter keyboards.\nL448: \nL449: I find that the sweet spot for portable productivity is with a 13-inch laptop \nL450: that has a 1080p resolution. You get ample screen real estate and crisp images, \nL451: a lightweight body that doesn\u2019t take up much space in a bag, and the price is \nL452: usually quite affordable.\nL453: \nL454: ## Ports and connectivity\nL455: \nL456: [Image 10: External hard drive plugged into side of Windows laptop] \u3010109\u2020Immo \nL457: Wegmann / Unsplash\u2020go.skimresources.com\u3011\nL458: \nL459: Ports are important on budget laptops, especially if you\u2019re sacrificing storage \nL460: space and screen size. With the right ports, you have the flexibility to connect\nL461:  external drives and external monitors.\nL462: \nL463: Thankfully, unless you go very low on price, you have good options. If possible,\nL464:  aim for at least one USB-C port and one USB-A port. USB-C has taken over as the","summary":"Buying a budget laptop?

On one end you have mainstream Chinese manufacturers like **Lenovo**, **Huawei**, **Xiaomi** and **ASUS** that have become global powerhouses.  Canalys data shows that in Q4\u00a02024 Lenovo shipped roughly **16.9\u00a0million** laptops worldwide and has maintained the #1 market share\u3010974435448442152\u2020L119-L133\u3011; its ThinkPad, Legion and Yoga lines are known for solid build quality and innovative designs (foldable screens, e\u2011ink lids)\u3010426002845858368\u2020L555-L563\u3011.  Xiaomi\u2019s Mi\u00a0Notebook Pro and RedmiBook series pack mid\u2011range Intel Core processors, SSD storage and thin metal chassis at student\u2011friendly prices\u3010974435448442152\u2020L169-L176\u3011.  These laptops compete directly with Dell and Apple in performance and design while often costing less\u3010974435448442152\u2020L73-L76\u3011.\n\nOn the other end are **budget brands** like **Chuwi** and **Teclast**, which target price\u2011sensitive markets.  They deliver decent specs for casual use \u2013 Chuwi\u2019s CoreBook\u00a0X comes with a 12th\u2011gen Intel\u00a0Core\u00a0i5, 16\u00a0GB RAM and a 2K screen\u3010864461160134218\u2020L229-L241\u3011 \u2013 but the low price hides compromises.  TechRadar notes that the CoreBook\u00a0X \u201clacks an easy means to upgrade the storage,\u201d offers only USB\u00a03.0\u2011grade ports and omits biometric security\u3010864461160134218\u2020L244-L248\u3011.  Reviewers also point out that its battery struggles to last a full workday\u3010864461160134218\u2020L252-L257\u3011.  Many budget sellers on marketplaces misrepresent their hardware: PCWorld found that a top\u2011selling \u201cLenovo\u00a0IdeaPad\u201d on Amazon claimed huge RAM and storage but used a sluggish Celeron\u00a0N4500 processor that scores **~731** on Geekbench \u2013 far slower than a modern Core\u00a0Ultra\u00a0120U (~7,500 points)\u301092524522479053\u2020L251-L263\u3011.  Some listings also hype integrated graphics as \u201cgaming\u2011class\u201d when they\u2019re two generations old\u301092524522479053\u2020L280-L306\u3011.\n\n### Are they worth it?\n\n- **Reputable Chinese brands (Lenovo, ASUS, Huawei, Xiaomi)** \u2013 Yes, these can be great values.  They offer current\u2011generation CPUs, good displays and respectable build quality at prices lower than many U.S. brands.  Warranty and support are usually solid in North America for Lenovo and ASUS, while Huawei laptops are harder to buy in the U.S. but popular abroad\u3010974435448442152\u2020L145-L159\u3011.  If you choose one of these brands, you\u2019re essentially buying a mainstream laptop that happens to be made in China.\n- **No\u2011name budget brands (Chuwi, Teclast and Amazon\u2011only sellers)** \u2013 Approach with caution.  They can be worth it if your needs are basic (web, Office, streaming) and you accept trade\u2011offs like shorter battery life, older processors and limited support.  Avoid listings that look \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d and don\u2019t trust enormous discount percentages.  Always verify the CPU/GPU model and search for its release year; PCWorld advises avoiding CPUs older than **two years** and GPUs older than **three years**\u301092524522479053\u2020L344-L359\u3011.  Check seller reviews \u2013 some buyers reported receiving used or completely different machines\u301092524522479053\u2020L265-L268\u3011.\n\n### What to look for (processing speed and other specs)\n\n| Spec/Feature | Recommended minimum for a decent experience (budget/low\u2011cost laptops) | Why it matters |\n|---|---|---|\n| **CPU** | At least an **Intel\u00a0Core\u00a0i3/i5** or **AMD\u00a0Ryzen\u00a03/5** (12th gen or newer).  PCWorld notes that i3/i5 or Ryzen\u00a03/5 chips handle everyday tasks and cost\u2011effectively\u301050831543413637\u2020L314-L323\u3011.  Avoid older Celeron/Pentium chips or random \u201c10\u2011core\u201d marketing claims \u2013 they often deliver poor real\u2011world performance\u301092524522479053\u2020L251-L263\u3011. | Modern CPUs have better single\u2011thread speed and efficiency, essential for responsive multitasking. |\n| **RAM (memory)** | **8\u00a0GB minimum**, **16\u00a0GB** if you can swing it\u301050831543413637\u2020L297-L304\u3011. | Insufficient RAM is the main reason cheap laptops feel slow when multiple tabs or apps are open. |\n| **Storage** | **128\u00a0GB SSD** minimum for Windows, **64\u00a0GB** for ChromeOS\u301050831543413637\u2020L375-L379\u3011.  Use SSDs or UFS; avoid slow eMMC drives\u301050831543413637\u2020L400-L405\u3011. | SSDs dramatically reduce boot and load times compared with eMMC or HDD. |\n| **Battery** | Claims of **10\u201312\u00a0hours** usually translate to ~8\u00a0hours in real use\u301050831543413637\u2020L350-L355\u3011.  Look for at least this rating unless you\u2019re comfortable carrying a charger. | A strong battery prevents mid\u2011day charging panic. |\n| **Display** | **1080p (Full\u00a0HD)** resolution is the minimum for comfortable reading and video\u301050831543413637\u2020L421-L431\u3011.  Some cheap laptops advertise 2K panels (like Chuwi\u2019s 2160\u00d71440)\u3010864461160134218\u2020L229-L241\u3011, but watch for sacrifices in other areas. | Higher resolution improves clarity; 720p displays look grainy and cramped. |\n| **Ports** | At least **one USB\u2011C and one USB\u2011A**, plus HDMI for external monitors\u301050831543413637\u2020L459-L468\u3011.  Budget Chinese laptops sometimes skimp on modern ports\u3010864461160134218\u2020L244-L248\u3011. | Adequate ports ensure you can connect drives, peripherals and displays without dongle overload. |\n| **GPU** (for gaming/graphics) | Integrated graphics (Intel\u00a0UHD/Iris or AMD\u00a0Radeon\u00a0iGPU) are fine for light tasks.  If you plan to game or edit video, look for an NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a04060 or better; Lenovo\u2019s Legion\u00a05i with an RTX\u00a04060 offers strong gaming value\u301092524522479053\u2020L399-L403\u3011. | \u201cGaming laptops\u201d with only integrated Vega or UHD graphics often can\u2019t handle modern games smoothly\u301092524522479053\u2020L294-L303\u3011. |\n\n### Bottom line\n\nIf you stick with established Chinese brands and ensure the CPU, RAM and storage meet modern baseline specs, a \u201ccheap\u201d Chinese laptop can deliver tremendous bang for your buck.  For general productivity, a recent Core\u00a0i5/Ryzen\u00a05 with 16\u00a0GB of RAM and a 512\u00a0GB SSD will feel plenty snappy.  For gaming or creative work, expect to pay more for a model with a discrete GPU and better cooling.  Most importantly, resist the siren song of ultra\u2011cheap listings that promise \u201chigh performance\u201d with unspecified processors or unrealistic discounts.  Do your research, verify hardware release dates, and buy from reputable sellers.\n\nWith those caveats in mind, a wallet\u2011friendly laptop from the Middle Kingdom can absolutely be a smart purchase \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re not trading away the fundamentals for a flashy spec sheet."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":333,"end_ix":360,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Top Chinese Laptop Brands To Watch In 2025 -","url":"https://reads.alibaba.com/top-chinese-laptop-brands-to-watch/#:~:text=1","text":"1.

Established Chinese manufacturers like **Lenovo**, **ASUS**, **Huawei**, and **Xiaomi** offer competitive prices while maintaining solid quality. These brands often feature current-generation CPUs, good displays, and reliable build quality, with Lenovo and ASUS providing strong warranty and support services. For example, Lenovo and Xiaomi's laptops compete with bigger brands like Dell and Apple in terms of performance and design, with Mi Notebook Pro and RedmiBook series offering good value in the mid-range price bracket.\n\nOn the other hand, budget brands like **Chuwi** and **Teclast** may have attractive prices but tend to cut corners in areas like battery life, ports, and processor speed. While these brands may suffice for casual use (email, streaming, web browsing), their low price points often mean compromises in performance and support. Users should be cautious when considering \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d deals and avoid outdated processors or falsely advertised graphics.\n\nTo judge whether these laptops are worth it, focus on established brands for reliable quality. For no-name or budget brands, ensure the specs match your needs and be aware of potential compromises.\n\nWhen buying, consider the following specs:\n\n- **CPU**: Look for at least Intel Core i5 (12th gen) or AMD Ryzen 5. Avoid older Celeron or Pentium processors.\n- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum; 16 GB if possible, especially for multitasking.\n- **Storage**: Minimum 128 GB SSD for Windows (64 GB for ChromeOS). SSDs offer faster boot and load times compared to eMMC drives.\n- **Battery**: Look for a battery that promises at least 8 hours of usage.\n- **Display**: 1080p (Full HD) should be the minimum for comfortable viewing.\n- **Ports**: At least one USB-C, one USB-A, and HDMI.\n- **GPU**: Integrated graphics (Intel or AMD) are fine for light tasks, but a dedicated GPU is necessary for gaming or video editing.\n\nOverall, high-performance Chinese laptops from reputable brands can offer great value, but caution should be taken with budget brands or overly discounted \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d listings. Ensure the laptop meets modern baseline specs for the best experience.","is_complete":true,"n7jupd_subtool":{"generic_api_func":null,"subtool":null,"used_internet":false,"changed_url":false,"result_of_subtool":null},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"f51a1fe0-e0f6-4ab3-8edc-dd8438c60f9e","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"b83d73ae-7f28-4f89-bb44-5dd485d65521","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"687bb9de-bf48-8322-8122-05ff05f76a28","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":["http://localhost:8451","https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oEE1rVp","https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-chuwi-corebook-x-is-cheap-for-several-important-reasons","https://www.pcworld.com/article/2413663/buying-a-budget-laptop-dont-go-below-these-minimum-specs.html/find?pattern=minimum","https://techtablets.com/recommended-chinese-notebooks-brands/","http://localhost:8674/search_available_apis?query=github","http://localhost:8451/image/[pdf_url","https://www.globalsources.com/knowledge/chinese-laptop-brands/","https://www.pcworld.com/article/2682518/buying-a-laptop-before-china-tariffs-kick-in-dont-fall-for-this-trick.html","https://www.pcworld.com/article/2682518/buying-a-laptop-before-china-tariffs-kick-in-dont-fall-for-this-trick.html/find?pattern=chinese","https://reads.alibaba.com/top-chinese-laptop-brands-to-watch/","http://localhost:8451/[pdf_url","http://localhost:8674","https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/best/brands","https://www.facebook.com/mark.manthy","https://www.pcworld.com/article/2413663/buying-a-budget-laptop-dont-go-below-these-minimum-specs.html","https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/best/brands/find?pattern=lenovo"],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"is_read_only":null,"voice":null,"async_status":4,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":false,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","context_scopes":null,"sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false,"owner":null,"id":"687bb9de-bf48-8322-8122-05ff05f76a28"}
