            "Proper pipeline management is essential for accurate sales forecasting for several key reasons:\n\n1. **Visibility into Sales Process**: A well-managed pipeline provides clear visibility into where each prospect stands in the sales process. This clarity allows for more accurate predictions of which deals are likely to close and when.\n\n2. **Quality Data**: Effective pipeline management ensures that the data in the pipeline is current and reliable. Accurate data is the foundation of any trustworthy forecast, as it reflects the true status of potential sales.\n\n3. **Understanding of Sales Cycle**: By managing the pipeline effectively, a sales team gains a deep understanding of their sales cycle, including how long it takes, on average, to convert a lead into a customer. This knowledge is critical for making realistic forecasts.\n\n4. **Lead Scoring Accuracy**: Proper pipeline management often includes lead scoring, which ranks prospects based on their likelihood to convert. This scoring helps in focusing on high-quality leads in forecasts.\n\n5. **Historical Trend Analysis**: A well-managed sales pipeline allows for the analysis of historical data, which can be used to identify trends and patterns in sales cycles. These insights are invaluable for forecasting future sales performance.\n\n6. **Deal Progress Tracking**: By continuously monitoring the progress of deals through the pipeline, sales teams can more accurately predict which deals are likely to close within a given period, enhancing the precision of the forecast.\n\n7. **Resource Allocation**: Effective pipeline management helps in identifying which areas require more resources. This allows for better allocation of sales efforts, which in turn leads to more accurate forecasting.\n\n8. **Identification of Potential Issues**: Regular pipeline reviews help in identifying potential issues in the sales process, such as bottlenecks or stages where prospects frequently drop out. Addressing these issues can lead to more predictable and stable sales outcomes.\n\n9. **Consistent Review and Adjustment**: A well-managed pipeline is regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed. This dynamic approach allows sales teams to quickly adapt their forecasts based on the latest data and market conditions.\n\n10. **Alignment with Market Conditions**: Proper pipeline management includes adapting the sales strategy to current market conditions. This alignment ensures that the forecasts are grounded in the reality of the market environment.\n\nIn summary, proper pipeline management contributes to accurate sales forecasting by ensuring high-quality, up-to-date data and a deep understanding of the sales process and market conditions. It allows sales teams to make informed predictions about future sales, leading to better strategic planning and decision-making."

            "A best-in-class sales forecast strategy involves a combination of accurate data analysis, effective sales pipeline management, and the use of advanced forecasting techniques. Here are the key components:\n\n1. **Robust CRM System**: Utilize a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to track all sales activities, customer interactions, and pipeline data. This system should be the single source of truth for all sales-related information.\n\n2. **Detailed Pipeline Management**: Keep the sales pipeline updated with all potential deals, their stages, values, and estimated close dates. Regularly clean the pipeline to remove stalled or lost deals.\n\n3. **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze past sales data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality. This analysis should inform your understanding of typical sales cycles, conversion rates, and average deal sizes.\n\n4. **Lead Scoring and Qualification**: Implement a lead scoring system to prioritize leads based on their likelihood to convert. Focus on high-quality leads in the forecast to improve accuracy.\n\n5. **Sales Team Input**: Regularly gather insights from the sales team about their deals. Their on-the-ground perspective is invaluable for understanding the nuances of each potential sale.\n\n6. **Market and Competitive Analysis**: Stay informed about market trends and competitor activities. Changes in the market can significantly impact your sales, and this should be factored into forecasts.\n\n7. **Segmentation of Sales Data**: Break down sales data by product line, region, sales channel, or customer type. This segmentation can reveal specific trends and patterns that are not visible in the aggregate data.\n\n8. **Use of Forecasting Models**: Employ statistical models and forecasting techniques like regression analysis, time series analysis, or machine learning algorithms, depending on the complexity and volume of your sales data.\n\n9. **Scenario Planning**: Develop forecasts under different scenarios (e.g., best case, worst case, most likely case) to understand potential outcomes and prepare for various situations.\n\n10. **Continuous Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust the forecasts based on the latest sales data, market trends, and feedback from the sales team.\n\n11. **Integration with Financial Planning**: Align sales forecasts with overall business financial planning. This ensures that forecasts are realistic and in line with business objectives.\n\n12. **Training and Development**: Train your sales team on the importance of accurate forecasting and how to effectively use the CRM and other forecasting tools.\n\n13. **Collaboration and Communication**: Foster a culture of collaboration and open communication across the sales team and other departments like marketing and finance, to ensure a unified approach to forecasting.\n\n14. **Accountability and Performance Tracking**: Hold sales representatives accountable for the accuracy of their forecasts and track performance over time to identify areas for improvement.\n\n15. **Leverage Technology and Automation**: Use advanced tools and technologies for data analysis and forecasting. Automation can help in processing large volumes of data and generating more accurate forecasts.\n\nA best-in-class sales forecast strategy is dynamic and adaptable, leveraging technology, data, and the insights of the sales team to predict future sales as accurately as possible. This strategy not only informs sales targets and goals but also guides overall business strategy and resource allocation."

The Halethorpe-based business started with just four employees in 2018, but now has 198 employees in two states \u2013 more than 160 in Maryland and the rest in Pennsylvania \u2013 with plans to open a Virginia location later this year.\n\nWithin three or four years, Lumina\u2019s workforce could double, he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be the best solar installation and services company in the country in our market class,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can be the #1 renewable energy company in Maryland in the residential and commercial space.\u201d\n\n[Image 1][Image 2]\n\nA native of Northern Baltimore County, Kirby has worked in the solar industry since graduating from college in 2009. When it came time to launch his own firm, Maryland\u2019s strong market made it a natural choice for Lumina\u2019s headquarters, as well as a recently opened second office in Halethorpe to support its commercial business.\n\nThe company has three areas of focus: residential solar installations, commercial solar installations, and energy services. Those adjacent services include maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.\n\nThe company sees opportunity ahead due to the growing appetite for renewable energy, particularly amid concerns about rising energy costs and climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important to deploy as much clean power throughout Maryland as possible in the next 20 years and we think we can lead the state's transition to a renewable based economy,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cTo do that, we have to be a great partner for our customers throughout Maryland by delivering a world-class installation and experience.\u201d\n\nLumina Solar also prides itself on creating a positive environment for its employees \u2013 it recently ranked among the \u301055\u2020Baltimore Sun\u2019s Top Workplaces for 2022\u2020www.baltimoresun.com\u3011 .\n\n\u201cWe want to be a great place for our colleagues to work and to build a future.

The Halethorpe-based business started with just four employees in 2018, but now has 198 employees in two states \u2013 more than 160 in Maryland and the rest in Pennsylvania \u2013 with plans to open a Virginia location later this year.\n\nWithin three or four years, Lumina\u2019s workforce could double, he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be the best solar installation and services company in the country in our market class,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can be the #1 renewable energy company in Maryland in the residential and commercial space.\u201d\n\n[Image 1][Image 2]\n\nA native of Northern Baltimore County, Kirby has worked in the solar industry since graduating from college in 2009. When it came time to launch his own firm, Maryland\u2019s strong market made it a natural choice for Lumina\u2019s headquarters, as well as a recently opened second office in Halethorpe to support its commercial business.\n\nThe company has three areas of focus: residential solar installations, commercial solar installations, and energy services. Those adjacent services include maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.\n\nThe company sees opportunity ahead due to the growing appetite for renewable energy, particularly amid concerns about rising energy costs and climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important to deploy as much clean power throughout Maryland as possible in the next 20 years and we think we can lead the state's transition to a renewable based economy,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cTo do that, we have to be a great partner for our customers throughout Maryland by delivering a world-class installation and experience.\u201d\n\nLumina Solar also prides itself on creating a positive environment for its employees \u2013 it recently ranked among the \u301055\u2020Baltimore Sun\u2019s Top Workplaces for 2022\u2020www.baltimoresun.com\u3011 .\n\n\u201cWe want to be a great place for our colleagues to work and to build a future. It's a core element of our long-term strategy,\u201d Kirby said.\n\n\u301029\u2020Renewable Energy in Maryland\u3011\n\nShare \n\nKeep up with the latest.\n\nSign up for e-mail

This strategy proved successful even amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While many companies faced layoffs and furloughs during this period, Lumina Solar managed to avoid these measures and even saw growth, doubling its number of employees. This expansion included hiring skilled tradesmen, operations, and administrative staff. The company filled several key management roles during this time, underscoring its robust approach to navigating difficult market conditions\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThroughout its history, Lumina Solar has shown a commitment to environmental sustainability and addressing climate change. The company specializes in residential and commercial solar installations and energy services, including maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.

The Halethorpe-based business started with just four employees in 2018, but now has 198 employees in two states \u2013 more than 160 in Maryland and the rest in Pennsylvania \u2013 with plans to open a Virginia location later this year.\n\nWithin three or four years, Lumina\u2019s workforce could double, he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be the best solar installation and services company in the country in our market class,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can be the #1 renewable energy company in Maryland in the residential and commercial space.\u201d\n\n[Image 1][Image 2]\n\nA native of Northern Baltimore County, Kirby has worked in the solar industry since graduating from college in 2009. When it came time to launch his own firm, Maryland\u2019s strong market made it a natural choice for Lumina\u2019s headquarters, as well as a recently opened second office in Halethorpe to support its commercial business.\n\nThe company has three areas of focus: residential solar installations, commercial solar installations, and energy services. Those adjacent services include maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.\n\nThe company sees opportunity ahead due to the growing appetite for renewable energy, particularly amid concerns about rising energy costs and climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important to deploy as much clean power throughout Maryland as possible in the next 20 years and we think we can lead the state's transition to a renewable based economy,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cTo do that, we have to be a great partner for our customers throughout Maryland by delivering a world-class installation and experience.\u201d\n\nLumina Solar also prides itself on creating a positive environment for its employees \u2013 it recently ranked among the \u301055\u2020Baltimore Sun\u2019s Top Workplaces for 2022\u2020www.baltimoresun.com\u3011 .\n\n\u201cWe want to be a great place for our colleagues to work and to build a future.

They are a full-service Solar Installer, and Maryland\u2019s Highest Rated Solar Company. \u201cLumina was founded because we felt there was an opportunity to create a truly great company and make a positive impact on the lives of our customers while tackling a really important problem; climate change\u201d \u2013 Mike Kirby, CEO & Co-Founder.  \n\nWith a heavy focus on the \u201ccustomer experience\u201d and drive to make an impact on environmental awareness Lumina Solar saw immediate growth, even featured on Midday Maryland on WMAR.  \n\nThe goal was simple; offer better products, newer technology, and the best customer service possible. Internally labeled and branded as the \u201cLumina Solar 2.0 Pledge.\u201d   \n\nThis is not an easy task, homeowners have been overpromised and underdelivered by other solar companies in Maryland for over a decade, but Lumina was well on their way to proving it was a viable concept, and then COVID-19 hit.  \n\n\u201cWe suddenly had to re-learn and re-tool our processes and do it quickly if we were going to survive the pandemic. The way we handled COVID and were able to quickly adapt to the pandemic climate without really missing a beat is one of the proudest moments I have had thus far at Lumina.\u201d Zachary Hare, Maryland Director of Sales & Co-Founder.  \n\nAll these changes so quickly could have been detrimental to most companies, but not Lumina Solar. By empowering their employees with the plan to not lay people off they noticed a rather unexpected change, they saw drastic growth.   \n\nWhile the rest of the country saw unemployment rise from 3.5% in January to 14.7% in April, Lumina Solar\u2019s proactive approach saw no layoffs and no furloughs. By the time August-September hit Lumina had hired more employees including some laid-off by other companies at the beginning of the pandemic.  \n\nIn fact, since March of 2020 Lumina Solar has doubled its total number of employees, including skilled tradesmen, operations, and administrative individuals. Recently multiple management roles of necessity were also filled including:   \n\nJune 2020 - Jessica Diday, Human Resources Director  \nAugust 2020 - Mark Manthy, Lead Commercial Solar Consultant  \nSeptember 2020 - Ryan Farrell, Director of Business Operations  \nJanuary 2021 - Robert Gill, Director of Marketing   \n\nOne thing is evident, Lumina Solar has the leadership and longevity needed to continue its growth. Despite a contentious election year, a pandemic, and a struggling economy Lumina was able and is able to \u201cFlip the Switch\u201d and follow through on their Solar 2.0 Pledge.  \n\n3600 Commerce Drive, Suite 601  \nHalethorpe, MD 21227  \nMark Donoghue   \n\nLumina Solar is incorporating the newest technology, and best financing in the industry in order to help homeowners go solar.

The Halethorpe-based business started with just four employees in 2018, but now has 198 employees in two states \u2013 more than 160 in Maryland and the rest in Pennsylvania \u2013 with plans to open a Virginia location later this year.\n\nWithin three or four years, Lumina\u2019s workforce could double, he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be the best solar installation and services company in the country in our market class,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can be the #1 renewable energy company in Maryland in the residential and commercial space.\u201d\n\n[Image 1][Image 2]\n\nA native of Northern Baltimore County, Kirby has worked in the solar industry since graduating from college in 2009. When it came time to launch his own firm, Maryland\u2019s strong market made it a natural choice for Lumina\u2019s headquarters, as well as a recently opened second office in Halethorpe to support its commercial business.\n\nThe company has three areas of focus: residential solar installations, commercial solar installations, and energy services. Those adjacent services include maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.\n\nThe company sees opportunity ahead due to the growing appetite for renewable energy, particularly amid concerns about rising energy costs and climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important to deploy as much clean power throughout Maryland as possible in the next 20 years and we think we can lead the state's transition to a renewable based economy,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cTo do that, we have to be a great partner for our customers throughout Maryland by delivering a world-class installation and experience.\u201d\n\nLumina Solar also prides itself on creating a positive environment for its employees \u2013 it recently ranked among the \u301055\u2020Baltimore Sun\u2019s Top Workplaces for 2022\u2020www.baltimoresun.com\u3011 .\n\n\u201cWe want to be a great place for our colleagues to work and to build a future.

They are a full-service Solar Installer, and Maryland\u2019s Highest Rated Solar Company. \u201cLumina was founded because we felt there was an opportunity to create a truly great company and make a positive impact on the lives of our customers while tackling a really important problem; climate change\u201d \u2013 Mike Kirby, CEO & Co-Founder.  \n\nWith a heavy focus on the \u201ccustomer experience\u201d and drive to make an impact on environmental awareness Lumina Solar saw immediate growth, even featured on Midday Maryland on WMAR.  \n\nThe goal was simple; offer better products, newer technology, and the best customer service possible. Internally labeled and branded as the \u201cLumina Solar 2.0 Pledge.\u201d   \n\nThis is not an easy task, homeowners have been overpromised and underdelivered by other solar companies in Maryland for over a decade, but Lumina was well on their way to proving it was a viable concept, and then COVID-19 hit.  \n\n\u201cWe suddenly had to re-learn and re-tool our processes and do it quickly if we were going to survive the pandemic. The way we handled COVID and were able to quickly adapt to the pandemic climate without really missing a beat is one of the proudest moments I have had thus far at Lumina.\u201d Zachary Hare, Maryland Director of Sales & Co-Founder.  \n\nAll these changes so quickly could have been detrimental to most companies, but not Lumina Solar. By empowering their employees with the plan to not lay people off they noticed a rather unexpected change, they saw drastic growth.   \n\nWhile the rest of the country saw unemployment rise from 3.5% in January to 14.7% in April, Lumina Solar\u2019s proactive approach saw no layoffs and no furloughs. By the time August-September hit Lumina had hired more employees including some laid-off by other companies at the beginning of the pandemic.  \n\nIn fact, since March of 2020 Lumina Solar has doubled its total number of employees, including skilled tradesmen, operations, and administrative individuals.

When it came time to launch his own firm, Maryland\u2019s strong market made it a natural choice for Lumina\u2019s headquarters, as well as a recently opened second office in Halethorpe to support its commercial business.\n\nThe company has three areas of focus: residential solar installations, commercial solar installations, and energy services. Those adjacent services include maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.\n\nThe company sees opportunity ahead due to the growing appetite for renewable energy, particularly amid concerns about rising energy costs and climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important to deploy as much clean power throughout Maryland as possible in the next 20 years and we think we can lead the state's transition to a renewable based economy,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cTo do that, we have to be a great partner for our customers throughout Maryland by delivering a world-class installation and experience.\u201d\n\nLumina Solar also prides itself on creating a positive environment for its employees \u2013 it recently ranked among the \u301055\u2020Baltimore Sun\u2019s Top Workplaces for 2022\u2020www.baltimoresun.com\u3011 .\n\n\u201cWe want to be a great place for our colleagues to work and to build a future.

They are a full-service Solar Installer, and Maryland\u2019s Highest Rated Solar Company. \u201cLumina was founded because we felt there was an opportunity to create a truly great company and make a positive impact on the lives of our customers while tackling a really important problem; climate change\u201d \u2013 Mike Kirby, CEO & Co-Founder.  \n\nWith a heavy focus on the \u201ccustomer experience\u201d and drive to make an impact on environmental awareness Lumina Solar saw immediate growth, even featured on Midday Maryland on WMAR.  \n\nThe goal was simple; offer better products, newer technology, and the best customer service possible. Internally labeled and branded as the \u201cLumina Solar 2.0 Pledge.\u201d   \n\nThis is not an easy task, homeowners have been overpromised and underdelivered by other solar companies in Maryland for over a decade, but Lumina was well on their way to proving it was a viable concept, and then COVID-19 hit.  \n\n\u201cWe suddenly had to re-learn and re-tool our processes and do it quickly if we were going to survive the pandemic. The way we handled COVID and were able to quickly adapt to the pandemic climate without really missing a beat is one of the proudest moments I have had thus far at Lumina.\u201d Zachary Hare, Maryland Director of Sales & Co-Founder.  \n\nAll these changes so quickly could have been detrimental to most companies, but not Lumina Solar. By empowering their employees with the plan to not lay people off they noticed a rather unexpected change, they saw drastic growth.   \n\nWhile the rest of the country saw unemployment rise from 3.5% in January to 14.7% in April, Lumina Solar\u2019s proactive approach saw no layoffs and no furloughs. By the time August-September hit Lumina had hired more employees including some laid-off by other companies at the beginning of the pandemic.  \n\nIn fact, since March of 2020 Lumina Solar has doubled its total number of employees, including skilled tradesmen, operations, and administrative individuals. Recently multiple management roles of necessity were also filled including:   \n\nJune 2020 - Jessica Diday, Human Resources Director  \nAugust 2020 - Mark Manthy, Lead Commercial Solar Consultant  \nSeptember 2020 - Ryan Farrell, Director of Business Operations  \nJanuary 2021 - Robert Gill, Director of Marketing   \n\nOne thing is evident, Lumina Solar has the leadership and longevity needed to continue its growth. Despite a contentious election year, a pandemic, and a struggling economy Lumina was able and is able to \u201cFlip the Switch\u201d and follow through on their Solar 2.0 Pledge.  \n\n3600 Commerce Drive, Suite 601  \nHalethorpe, MD 21227  \nMark Donoghue   \n\nLumina Solar is incorporating the newest technology, and best financing in the industry in order to help homeowners go solar.

When it came time to launch his own firm, Maryland\u2019s strong market made it a natural choice for Lumina\u2019s headquarters, as well as a recently opened second office in Halethorpe to support its commercial business.\n\nThe company has three areas of focus: residential solar installations, commercial solar installations, and energy services. Those adjacent services include maintenance for existing solar systems, EV charger installations, and roofing.\n\nThe company sees opportunity ahead due to the growing appetite for renewable energy, particularly amid concerns about rising energy costs and climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important to deploy as much clean power throughout Maryland as possible in the next 20 years and we think we can lead the state's transition to a renewable based economy,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cTo do that, we have to be a great partner for our customers throughout Maryland by delivering a world-class installation and experience.\u201d\n\nLumina Solar also prides itself on creating a positive environment for its employees \u2013 it recently ranked among the \u301055\u2020Baltimore Sun\u2019s Top Workplaces for 2022\u2020www.baltimoresun.com\u3011 .\n\n\u201cWe want to be a great place for our colleagues to work and to build a future.

They are a full-service Solar Installer, and Maryland\u2019s Highest Rated Solar Company. \u201cLumina was founded because we felt there was an opportunity to create a truly great company and make a positive impact on the lives of our customers while tackling a really important problem; climate change\u201d \u2013 Mike Kirby, CEO & Co-Founder.  \n\nWith a heavy focus on the \u201ccustomer experience\u201d and drive to make an impact on environmental awareness Lumina Solar saw immediate growth, even featured on Midday Maryland on WMAR.  \n\nThe goal was simple; offer better products, newer technology, and the best customer service possible. Internally labeled and branded as the \u201cLumina Solar 2.0 Pledge.\u201d   \n\nThis is not an easy task, homeowners have been overpromised and underdelivered by other solar companies in Maryland for over a decade, but Lumina was well on their way to proving it was a viable concept, and then COVID-19 hit.  \n\n\u201cWe suddenly had to re-learn and re-tool our processes and do it quickly if we were going to survive the pandemic. The way we handled COVID and were able to quickly adapt to the pandemic climate without really missing a beat is one of the proudest moments I have had thus far at Lumina.\u201d Zachary Hare, Maryland Director of Sales & Co-Founder.  \n\nAll these changes so quickly could have been detrimental to most companies, but not Lumina Solar. By empowering their employees with the plan to not lay people off they noticed a rather unexpected change, they saw drastic growth.   \n\nWhile the rest of the country saw unemployment rise from 3.5% in January to 14.7% in April, Lumina Solar\u2019s proactive approach saw no layoffs and no furloughs. By the time August-September hit Lumina had hired more employees including some laid-off by other companies at the beginning of the pandemic.  \n\nIn fact, since March of 2020 Lumina Solar has doubled its total number of employees, including skilled tradesmen, operations, and administrative individuals. Recently multiple management roles of necessity were also filled including:   \n\nJune 2020 - Jessica Diday, Human Resources Director  \nAugust 2020 - Mark Manthy, Lead Commercial Solar Consultant  \nSeptember 2020 - Ryan Farrell, Director of Business Operations  \nJanuary 2021 - Robert Gill, Director of Marketing   \n\nOne thing is evident, Lumina Solar has the leadership and longevity needed to continue its growth. Despite a contentious election year, a pandemic, and a struggling economy Lumina was able and is able to \u201cFlip the Switch\u201d and follow through on their Solar 2.0 Pledge.  \n\n3600 Commerce Drive, Suite 601  \nHalethorpe, MD 21227  \nMark Donoghue   \n\nLumina Solar is incorporating the newest technology, and best financing in the industry in order to help homeowners go solar. Our team has 50+ years of combined solar experience, and makes the process of going solar easy!  \n\nThis release was published on openPR.  \n\nPermanent link to this press release: \n\nCopy\n\nPlease set a link in the press area of your homepage to this press release on openPR. openPR disclaims liability for any content contained in this release. \n\n\u301031\u2020 Share\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n\n\u301032\u2020 Tweet \u2020twitter.com\u3011\n\n\u301033\u2020 \u2020send\u3011\n\nEmail\n\n### You can edit or delete your press release Lumina Solar, a bright spot in a dark year. here\n\n    Delete press release     Edit press release News-ID: 2225462 \u2022 Views: 2209\n\n## More Releases from Lumina Solar\n\n[Image 4]  [Image 5: Lumina Solar works with Local Charity to provide support to families in need.] \n\n12-04-2020 | \u30108\u2020Energy & Environment\u3011   \n\u301030\u2020Lumina Solar\u3011 \n\n\u301034\u2020 Lumina Solar works with Local Charity to provide support to families in need. \u3011 \n\nIn a year enveloped in uncertainty, many Marylanders are struggling to simply make ends meet.
