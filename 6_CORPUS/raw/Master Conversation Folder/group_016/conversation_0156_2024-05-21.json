By the end of 2023, the company will have installed dozens of reclosers that allow crews to isolate a problem on one portion of a power line while keeping electricity flowing through the rest of the line.\n\nDon McGettigan, acting president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations: \"As the population has grown across our Maryland service area, so has the demand for electricity, especially as customers adopt electrification tactics in their homes and businesses. Our company's continued investments in the energy distribution system will help us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable and affordable electricity to homes, businesses and communities.\"\n\nPotomac Edison customers will continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies. The updated rates in the Oct. 18 order from the PSC went into effect and are now active. The bill impact of the newly approved rates will be partially offset at the beginning of 2024 by a decrease in the Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS), resulting in a 3.5 percent overall increase \u2013 or $4.62 monthly \u2013 for the average Potomac Edison residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month.\n\nPotomac Edison has grown significantly in the last five years, now serving approximately 20,000 more Maryland customers than it did during its last base distribution rate review in 2018. Prior to that rate update, the company did not increase its base rate for nearly 25 years. The company currently provides power to about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties. Potomac Edison also serves about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia who are unaffected by the rate review.\n\nPotomac Edison continues efforts to keep costs manageable for customers. To help customers manage their bills, Potomac Edison offers an average payment plan, special payment plans and access to energy assistance programs.

By the end of 2023, the company will have installed dozens of\u00a0reclosers that allow crews to isolate a problem on one portion of a power line while keeping electricity flowing through the rest of\u00a0the line.\n\nDon McGettigan, acting president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations: \"As the population has grown across our Maryland service area, so has the demand for electricity, especially as customers adopt electrification tactics in their homes and businesses. Our company's continued investments in the energy distribution system will help us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable and affordable electricity to homes, businesses and communities.\"\n\nPotomac Edison customers will continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies. The updated rates in the Oct. 18 order from the PSC went into effect and are now active. The bill impact of the newly approved rates will be partially offset at the beginning of 2024 by a decrease in the Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS), resulting in a 3.5 percent overall increase \u2013 or $4.62 monthly \u2013 for the average Potomac Edison residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month.\n\nPotomac Edison has grown significantly in the last five years, now serving approximately 20,000 more Maryland customers than it did during its last base distribution rate review in 2018. Prior to that rate update, the company did not increase its base rate for nearly 25 years. The company currently provides power to about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties. Potomac Edison also serves about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia who are unaffected by the rate review.\n\nPotomac Edison continues efforts to keep costs manageable for customers. To help customers manage their bills, Potomac Edison offers an average payment plan, special payment plans and access to energy assistance programs.

            "Potomac Edison, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp, has received approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) for a $28 million rate adjustment. This change, effective from October 18, 2023, aims to support ongoing service reliability improvements, such as tree trimming, equipment inspections, and maintenance to prevent power outages during severe weather conditions. \n\nFor commercial customers in Washington County, this rate adjustment will result in an overall increase of 3.5% in their electric bills starting in early 2024. This increase is somewhat mitigated by a decrease in the Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS). Despite these changes, Potomac Edison customers will continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30107\u2020source\u3011."

By the end of 2023, the company will have installed dozens of reclosers that allow crews to isolate a problem on one portion of a power line while keeping electricity flowing through the rest of the line.\n\nDon McGettigan, acting president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations: \"As the population has grown across our Maryland service area, so has the demand for electricity, especially as customers adopt electrification tactics in their homes and businesses. Our company's continued investments in the energy distribution system will help us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable and affordable electricity to homes, businesses and communities.\"\n\nPotomac Edison customers will continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies. The updated rates in the Oct. 18 order from the PSC went into effect and are now active. The bill impact of the newly approved rates will be partially offset at the beginning of 2024 by a decrease in the Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS), resulting in a 3.5 percent overall increase \u2013 or $4.62 monthly \u2013 for the average Potomac Edison residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month.\n\nPotomac Edison has grown significantly in the last five years, now serving approximately 20,000 more Maryland customers than it did during its last base distribution rate review in 2018. Prior to that rate update, the company did not increase its base rate for nearly 25 years. The company currently provides power to about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties. Potomac Edison also serves about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia who are unaffected by the rate review.\n\nPotomac Edison continues efforts to keep costs manageable for customers. To help customers manage their bills, Potomac Edison offers an average payment plan, special payment plans and access to energy assistance programs.

By the end of 2023, the company will have installed dozens of\u00a0reclosers that allow crews to isolate a problem on one portion of a power line while keeping electricity flowing through the rest of\u00a0the line.\n\nDon McGettigan, acting president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations: \"As the population has grown across our Maryland service area, so has the demand for electricity, especially as customers adopt electrification tactics in their homes and businesses. Our company's continued investments in the energy distribution system will help us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable and affordable electricity to homes, businesses and communities.\"\n\nPotomac Edison customers will continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies. The updated rates in the Oct. 18 order from the PSC went into effect and are now active. The bill impact of the newly approved rates will be partially offset at the beginning of 2024 by a decrease in the Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS), resulting in a 3.5 percent overall increase \u2013 or $4.62 monthly \u2013 for the average Potomac Edison residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month.\n\nPotomac Edison has grown significantly in the last five years, now serving approximately 20,000 more Maryland customers than it did during its last base distribution rate review in 2018. Prior to that rate update, the company did not increase its base rate for nearly 25 years. The company currently provides power to about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties. Potomac Edison also serves about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia who are unaffected by the rate review.\n\nPotomac Edison continues efforts to keep costs manageable for customers. To help customers manage their bills, Potomac Edison offers an average payment plan, special payment plans and access to energy assistance programs.
