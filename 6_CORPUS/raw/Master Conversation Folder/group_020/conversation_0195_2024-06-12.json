Admission will remain free to all guests.\n\n\u201cBaltimore\u2019s roster of annual festivals has changed a lot since the pandemic, but we\u2019re proud that WTMD\u2019s First Thursdays will continue presenting diverse music lineups and amplifying our community,\u201d said Craig Swagler, President and General Manager of Your Public Radio Corp., which owns WTMD. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to welcome thousands of Baltimoreans to enjoy free music by the harbor and showcase some of the city\u2019s many local food and craft vendors.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe First Thursday Festival series drew its largest-ever audience in June 2023, with an estimated 12,000 people in attendance. The 2023 First Thursday season also set a new record with nearly 100 locally based vendors and artisans, including a new Baker Artist Alley, showcasing works by members of the \u301022\u2020Baker Artist Portfolio\u2020bakerartist.org\u3011.\n\n\u201cFirst Thursdays is our love letter to Baltimore,\u201d said Sam Sessa, WTMD\u2019s Director of Events. \u201cDespite the challenges of rising costs, last season was a smashing success, and we\u2019re thrilled to help bring this series back to the city this summer.\u201d\n\nFounded two decades ago in Mt. Vernon Place, First Thursdays moved to Canton Waterfront Park in 2014 and has featured free performances by established indie artists such as Los Lonely Boys, Joan Osborne and Lake Street Dive, as well as rising stars the Black Pumas, Waxahatchee and many others.\u00a0\n\nWTMD\u2019s 2024 First Thursday Festival series is made possible with support from Baltimore City Rec & Parks, CFG Bank, McCormick, Breakthru Beverage, Chesapeake Beverage and other unique and local businesses such as Ekiben and Fuzzie\u2019s Burgers.
