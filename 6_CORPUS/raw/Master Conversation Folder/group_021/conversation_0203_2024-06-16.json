            "Please create this image In the early 1960s, Las Vegas was still the ultimate playground for the stars, and the Rat Pack was at the peak of their fame. One warm evening, after a spectacular performance at the Sands Hotel and Casino's Copa Room, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. decided they needed a late-night bite. They headed to The Garden Room, the upscale restaurant inside the Sands, only to find it had just closed for the night.\n\nHowever, the allure of the Rat Pack was undeniable, and the staff quickly reopened the restaurant for the legendary trio. As they settled into their plush, red leather seats, the smoky haze from countless cigarettes created an intimate, almost magical atmosphere. The table was adorned with glasses of bourbon, martinis, and champagne, reflecting the opulence of the evening.\n\nJust as the night seemed perfect, Cab Calloway, the famed bandleader known for his \"Hi-De-Ho\" scatting style, joined the table. Cab was performing his electrifying show at the nearby Moulin Rouge, the first integrated casino in Las Vegas, breaking barriers and winning hearts nightly.\n\nAs the group laughed and reminisced, hunger struck, and Cab decided he wanted a cheeseburger. As he casually ordered, Frank Sinatra leaned in, his blue eyes sparkling with mischief, and said, \"Come on, Cabby, baby. If you want that burger, you gotta do better than that.\"\n\nCab grinned widely and began to scat his order in the style of his greatest hit, \"Minnie the Moocher.\" \"Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho, I want a cheeseburger with everything on the go, medium rare, didi doo doop!\"\n\nThe waiter, clearly entertained, asked, \"And what would you like on top?\"\n\nWithout missing a beat, Cab continued, \"Lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and a fried egg and bacon, boop boop-a-doop!\"\n\nSammy Davis Jr. laughed heartily, \"Cabby Baby! It\u2019s not time for breakfast yet!\"\n\nCab chuckled and explained, \"Well, you know, before all this, I used to be a short-order cook at an all-night diner in Washington, D.C., during the Depression. The railroad workers would come in at 4 in the morning. They wanted something for breakfast but also for lunch since they kept such late hours. Some habits just stick!\"\n\nJust as the waiter brought out the burger, a young Elvis Presley walked through the door. Fresh from a successful show at the International Hotel, Elvis was in high spirits. The aroma and commotion drew Elvis's attention, and he leaned over, curiosity piqued. \"What's that?\" he asked, his voice filled with southern charm.\n\nDean Martin, ever the comedian, quipped, \"That's a scat burger, baby.\"\n\nThe waiter soon returned with Cab's creation, a towering masterpiece that looked like a work of art. The burger, piled high with all the fixings, gleamed under the dim lights of The Garden Room. The sight and smell were irresistible.\n\nWord of Cab's unique order quickly spread throughout the Vegas nightlife. Though the \"scat burger\" never appeared on the official menu, those in the know could always order it. It became a symbol of the wild, unpredictable nights at The Sands, a testament to the magic of Las Vegas in its heyday."
