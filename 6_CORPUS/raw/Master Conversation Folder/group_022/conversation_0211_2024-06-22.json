Sehr behaglich  \nTchaikovsky - Finale from Swan Lake \n\nRepertoire subject to change \n\n# Chamber Track \n\nBSO Academy Chamber Orchestra Conductor, \u301077\u2020Jonathan Carney\u3011\n\nRepertoire:  \n\nMendelssohn - Symphony No. 1   \nHaydn - Symphony No. 104\n\nRepertoire subject to change \n\nAll tracks include:\n\n  * Welcome dinner with BSO musicians\n  * Instrument-specific workshops\n  * Classes led by BSO musicians\n  * Special topics in musicology, wellness, and more led by guest lecturers\n  * Lunches with BSO musicians\n  * Performance on the Meyerhoff stage, free and open to the public\n  * Opportunity to collaborate with BSO Pianist-in-Residence, Lura Johnson, as part of the Solo with Piano Recital\n  * Take private lessons with BSO musicians for an additional fee\n  * Perform in large ensembles (string orchestra, flute ensemble, clarinet ensemble, double reed choir, brass choir, or percussion ensemble) led by BSO musicians\n\nAdditional components of each track:\n\nOrchestral Track\n\n  * Side-by-side rehearsals with BSO musicians\n  * Virtual workshops with BSO musicians prior to the Academy\n  * Sectionals led by BSO musicians\n\nChamber Track\n\n  * Perform and rehearse under BSO Concertmaster Jonathan Carney\n  * String sections led by BSO principals\n  * Perform in a chamber group alongside a BSO musician\n\nPlease note that you may elect to perform in a chamber group even if you are not in the chamber track. Placement in a chamber group is dependent on instrumentation needs and we cannot guarantee a spot to everyone who signs up.\n\n\u276fWhen will I receive my music?\n\nPractice parts will be distributed via email once part assignments are made. Spiral bound hard copies will be mailed to you in May.\n\n\u276fWhere can I park during the week?\n\nAs of February 2023, the former Cathedral Street Garage is closed. Parking will be available at a discounted rate of $5 per day at the Symphony Center Garage, located at 1030 Park Avenue. $5 vouchers must be purchased in advance and can be picked up upon registration. You may also consider street parking. Parking for those with mobility issues can be arranged with the Academy staff. Please note that overnight parking is PROHIBITED at the Symphony Center Garage.\n\n\u276fWill shuttle service be provided from our hotels to the Meyerhoff?\n\nDue to lack of demand, we are unable to offer shuttles between the hotels and the Meyerhoff. We encourage carpooling with fellow Academy participants or arranging rideshares via Uber or Lyft.\n\n\u276fWhat is the age requirement for the Academy Week?\n\nAll participants must be 18 years old by the first day of the Academy Week. The average age for Academy Week participants is about 64, but in 2018 participants ranged from 22 to 75 years of age. Special consideration for participants under age 18 might be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u276fWhere can I practice by myself during the Academy Week?\n\nPractice spaces at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall are shared and communal. A limited number of private practice spaces may be available on a first come, first served basis. \n\n\u276fIs there a requirement for playing ability?\n\nThe BSO Academy does not require an audition to be accepted. However, a basic knowledge of reading music is required, and the program is most enjoyable for participants who can comfortably play or follow along with the level of the selected repertoire and contribute to conversations about the techniques used to play the repertoire. Many participants are not able to play every single note in a difficult passage. You don\u2019t have to! The entire BSO is sitting with you and will cover the parts that are beyond your ability. The BSO faculty will guide you with suggestions on how to simplify or otherwise make it through a tough passage.

Sehr behaglich  \nTchaikovsky - Finale from Swan Lake \n\nRepertoire subject to change \n\n# Chamber Track \n\nBSO Academy Chamber Orchestra Conductor, \u301077\u2020Jonathan Carney\u3011\n\nRepertoire:  \n\nMendelssohn - Symphony No. 1   \nHaydn - Symphony No. 104\n\nRepertoire subject to change \n\nAll tracks include:\n\n  * Welcome dinner with BSO musicians\n  * Instrument-specific workshops\n  * Classes led by BSO musicians\n  * Special topics in musicology, wellness, and more led by guest lecturers\n  * Lunches with BSO musicians\n  * Performance on the Meyerhoff stage, free and open to the public\n  * Opportunity to collaborate with BSO Pianist-in-Residence, Lura Johnson, as part of the Solo with Piano Recital\n  * Take private lessons with BSO musicians for an additional fee\n  * Perform in large ensembles (string orchestra, flute ensemble, clarinet ensemble, double reed choir, brass choir, or percussion ensemble) led by BSO musicians\n\nAdditional components of each track:\n\nOrchestral Track\n\n  * Side-by-side rehearsals with BSO musicians\n  * Virtual workshops with BSO musicians prior to the Academy\n  * Sectionals led by BSO musicians\n\nChamber Track\n\n  * Perform and rehearse under BSO Concertmaster Jonathan Carney\n  * String sections led by BSO principals\n  * Perform in a chamber group alongside a BSO musician\n\nPlease note that you may elect to perform in a chamber group even if you are not in the chamber track. Placement in a chamber group is dependent on instrumentation needs and we cannot guarantee a spot to everyone who signs up.\n\n\u276fWhen will I receive my music?\n\nPractice parts will be distributed via email once part assignments are made. Spiral bound hard copies will be mailed to you in May.\n\n\u276fWhere can I park during the week?\n\nAs of February 2023, the former Cathedral Street Garage is closed. Parking will be available at a discounted rate of $5 per day at the Symphony Center Garage, located at 1030 Park Avenue. $5 vouchers must be purchased in advance and can be picked up upon registration. You may also consider street parking. Parking for those with mobility issues can be arranged with the Academy staff. Please note that overnight parking is PROHIBITED at the Symphony Center Garage.\n\n\u276fWill shuttle service be provided from our hotels to the Meyerhoff?\n\nDue to lack of demand, we are unable to offer shuttles between the hotels and the Meyerhoff. We encourage carpooling with fellow Academy participants or arranging rideshares via Uber or Lyft.\n\n\u276fWhat is the age requirement for the Academy Week?\n\nAll participants must be 18 years old by the first day of the Academy Week. The average age for Academy Week participants is about 64, but in 2018 participants ranged from 22 to 75 years of age. Special consideration for participants under age 18 might be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u276fWhere can I practice by myself during the Academy Week?\n\nPractice spaces at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall are shared and communal. A limited number of private practice spaces may be available on a first come, first served basis. \n\n\u276fIs there a requirement for playing ability?\n\nThe BSO Academy does not require an audition to be accepted. However, a basic knowledge of reading music is required, and the program is most enjoyable for participants who can comfortably play or follow along with the level of the selected repertoire and contribute to conversations about the techniques used to play the repertoire. Many participants are not able to play every single note in a difficult passage. You don\u2019t have to! The entire BSO is sitting with you and will cover the parts that are beyond your ability. The BSO faculty will guide you with suggestions on how to simplify or otherwise make it through a tough passage. We welcome a short recording of your playing if you are not sure if this program is right for you and would like our advice.\n\n\u276fWhere do participants come from?\n\nA large amount of Academy participants hail from the Mid-Atlantic region of the US (Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, etc.), but many of our participants come from even further. Participants in the 2023 BSO Academy represented over 20 states, stretching from Vermont to Hawaii, and 3 countries: Canada, China, and the United States!\n\n* * *\n\nQuestions?

Placement in a chamber group is dependent on instrumentation needs and we cannot guarantee a spot to everyone who signs up.\n\n\u276fWhen will I receive my music?\n\nPractice parts will be distributed via email once part assignments are made. Spiral bound hard copies will be mailed to you in May.\n\n\u276fWhere can I park during the week?\n\nAs of February 2023, the former Cathedral Street Garage is closed. Parking will be available at a discounted rate of $5 per day at the Symphony Center Garage, located at 1030 Park Avenue. $5 vouchers must be purchased in advance and can be picked up upon registration. You may also consider street parking. Parking for those with mobility issues can be arranged with the Academy staff. Please note that overnight parking is PROHIBITED at the Symphony Center Garage.\n\n\u276fWill shuttle service be provided from our hotels to the Meyerhoff?\n\nDue to lack of demand, we are unable to offer shuttles between the hotels and the Meyerhoff. We encourage carpooling with fellow Academy participants or arranging rideshares via Uber or Lyft.\n\n\u276fWhat is the age requirement for the Academy Week?\n\nAll participants must be 18 years old by the first day of the Academy Week. The average age for Academy Week participants is about 64, but in 2018 participants ranged from 22 to 75 years of age. Special consideration for participants under age 18 might be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u276fWhere can I practice by myself during the Academy Week?\n\nPractice spaces at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall are shared and communal. A limited number of private practice spaces may be available on a first come, first served basis. \n\n\u276fIs there a requirement for playing ability?\n\nThe BSO Academy does not require an audition to be accepted. However, a basic knowledge of reading music is required, and the program is most enjoyable for participants who can comfortably play or follow along with the level of the selected repertoire and contribute to conversations about the techniques used to play the repertoire. Many participants are not able to play every single note in a difficult passage. You don\u2019t have to! The entire BSO is sitting with you and will cover the parts that are beyond your ability. The BSO faculty will guide you with suggestions on how to simplify or otherwise make it through a tough passage. We welcome a short recording of your playing if you are not sure if this program is right for you and would like our advice.\n\n\u276fWhere do participants come from?\n\nA large amount of Academy participants hail from the Mid-Atlantic region of the US (Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, etc.), but many of our participants come from even further. Participants in the 2023 BSO Academy represented over 20 states, stretching from Vermont to Hawaii, and 3 countries: Canada, China, and the United States!\n\n* * *\n\nQuestions?

Placement in a chamber group is dependent on instrumentation needs and we cannot guarantee a spot to everyone who signs up.\n\n\u276fWhen will I receive my music?\n\nPractice parts will be distributed via email once part assignments are made. Spiral bound hard copies will be mailed to you in May.\n\n\u276fWhere can I park during the week?\n\nAs of February 2023, the former Cathedral Street Garage is closed. Parking will be available at a discounted rate of $5 per day at the Symphony Center Garage, located at 1030 Park Avenue. $5 vouchers must be purchased in advance and can be picked up upon registration. You may also consider street parking. Parking for those with mobility issues can be arranged with the Academy staff. Please note that overnight parking is PROHIBITED at the Symphony Center Garage.\n\n\u276fWill shuttle service be provided from our hotels to the Meyerhoff?\n\nDue to lack of demand, we are unable to offer shuttles between the hotels and the Meyerhoff. We encourage carpooling with fellow Academy participants or arranging rideshares via Uber or Lyft.\n\n\u276fWhat is the age requirement for the Academy Week?\n\nAll participants must be 18 years old by the first day of the Academy Week. The average age for Academy Week participants is about 64, but in 2018 participants ranged from 22 to 75 years of age. Special consideration for participants under age 18 might be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u276fWhere can I practice by myself during the Academy Week?\n\nPractice spaces at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall are shared and communal. A limited number of private practice spaces may be available on a first come, first served basis. \n\n\u276fIs there a requirement for playing ability?\n\nThe BSO Academy does not require an audition to be accepted. However, a basic knowledge of reading music is required, and the program is most enjoyable for participants who can comfortably play or follow along with the level of the selected repertoire and contribute to conversations about the techniques used to play the repertoire. Many participants are not able to play every single note in a difficult passage. You don\u2019t have to! The entire BSO is sitting with you and will cover the parts that are beyond your ability. The BSO faculty will guide you with suggestions on how to simplify or otherwise make it through a tough passage.
