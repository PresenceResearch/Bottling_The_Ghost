            "please take this call transcript and map it into a solutions call template.  Please cite specific examples in this call for key points in the template 0:00 | Shane\none sec. \n\n0:11 | Shane\nAll right. You with me? Perfect. May I look at you in the office or\u2026 early on a Friday? You, you must have some golfing to do a little later on? No, I. \n\n0:26 | Robb\nI just want to knock it out so I can get out of here. \n\n0:29 | Shane\nI don't blame you. That's that's the way I see it. I was actually appreciated of this. I lined up to behind you. And then I'm like man, I have worked, you know, six, seven hours by then get out of here. Yeah. All right. Well, look, I appreciate you jumping back on here. You know, getting me in contact, mark Miller was a great help. I will tell you if you ever go this road again, just get somebody hooked up with Jimmy, your facilities manager at those clubs. He, he knows everything there is to know about those buildings. I ended up talking with him and he just kinda knocked it all out with sure. So I was able to get the information for whitemarsh, towson, and eldersberg, we can strictly focus on whitemarsh. If you want to focus there. If you want to see the other ones. I mean, at the end of it all, they've really all three\u2026 fall in the same bucket as far as we're concerned, right? From an install perspective, from the layout of the roof, you know, it's all kind of the same. So the reality, is all the payback, everything, you know, I just know there's, some nuances that you described on your end? \n\n1:35 | Robb\nMaybe it has to do with ownership. \n\n1:38 | Shane\nExactly. Yeah. So, so I can show you what we see on our end. And then obviously, you can dive, you know, into, the nuances on, you know, behind the scenes for you guys. \n\n1:47 | Robb\nLet's focus on whitemarsh because that one is owned by the club. \n\n1:51 | Shane\nOkay. \n\n1:52 | Robb\nEasy, as for us to do from an ownership perspective, the other ones, I still haven't figured it out. So. \n\n1:58 | Shane\nOkay. That's fine. It's a good start. And then Rob, if you don't mind again, just sort of recapping\u2026 what has you motivated to, you know, hear me out, right? Like what's what sort of the motivations, in looking into this? \n\n2:15 | Robb\nMotivation here would be\u2026 you know, reducing their electric Bill. So basically, what you're saying, is, I mean just an operating expense situation, right? So that, what other motivation would there be? Well, I mean. \n\n2:33 | Shane\nMean, just looking at obviously, the overall company, you know, yes, you're reducing their cost but you're creating, you know, value there, right? Like I mean, eventually, this system sort of pays for itself. You know, it gets a little further than reducing that operating expense and actually creating, a bit of an income stream over time, right? You'll actually make some money off of the system rather than that. \n\n2:55 | Robb\nWell, that wouldn't be a motivation. We make money by running a fitness club, not by selling electric. Well, that's. \n\n3:04 | Shane\nselling electra that's not what I. \n\n3:06 | Robb\nWe're saving money. We're saving money, right? I mean, chain\u2026 if you're gonna save us what? 70,000 dollars a year in electricity Bill, something like that, but the white Marsh club makes, you know, a half a 1,000,000 dollars a year or 600,000 dollars a year. So in the overall scheme of things, it's no, it's still 70,000 bucks, which is important, but it's not, I, you're not doubling my income. \n\n3:34 | Shane\nRight, right. Right. I'm with you. All right. Well, let's run through sort of what I have here\u2026 get you here, share the screen. \n\n3:53 | Shane\nAll right. So here's sort of the broad overview\u2026 your system sides pans out at about 206 point six K dub. \n\n4:04 | Robb\nYeah. Well. \n\n4:05 | Shane\nSystem about five and a quarter. The projected payback is about four to five years really. Right now, it's leaning into the fourth\u2026 the systems. Yeah, it's really designed. Well. The layout is really good. So sort of what we know, you have one inter connection that we're going to offset right now, that inter connection so that you're aware is about eight, 750 to 800,000 kilowatt hours annually. Okay. I'm going to produce about 260,000 exactly quick math, you know, a little over a quarter of that electricity Bill. I'm gonna be able to reduce off of there. It doesn't change the economics of what I can or cannot save you, right? Like you're gonna pay vge, no matter what, right? Or, your third party, you know, whether it's 10 percent 100 percent, you know, the savings of the savings because you're always going to pay BG. \n\n5:02 | Robb\nRight? Because you can't produce enough. \n\n5:04 | Shane\nExactly. But\u2026 up there, we do have a rock ballast roof. Sort of the implications here are how it will come down to the ballast rays and how the engineers want to design this. So the only thing that could happen, the system could get slightly smaller, but we would change the degree of the panel pitch from a five degree to a 10 degree overall. The production would likely go down slightly, but the economics would technically get slightly better just because they would produce more. But again the overall system and the overall offset would get slightly less. I making sense there. \n\n5:54 | Robb\nI guess so, and that what that has to do with whether the roof can hold the system? \n\n5:58 | Shane\nNot so much the roof holding, the river rock that's up there is large, right? And we want to lay ballast rays on top of that rock, right? Without having to penetrate the roof when we do that river rock is so large, those ballast rates could kind of\u2026 the wind lift, and that sort of thing could be impactful. So, the engineers need to understand and do that study on it. And it's not as easy as mean, yes or no because they can actually measure the parapet wall that's around the Edge, right? That could actually reduce the wind lift. There's so many things that go into it that I don't do you know that I'm not going to sit here and tell you, I know one way or the other, okay, we will ultimately decide on the best, you know, option for you and present that to you. You know, once we get there that's sort of the, you know, it's a construction project, right? We've got to get real people not just me on the roof to sort of understand, you know, this is a longterm hold for you. So, you know, in addition to that payback right? You do continue to produce electricity, you know, long term, which is great. Again, what we don't know the ballast system is gonna be required that will impact, you know, roughly the final system and size layout. I always put structural suitability. What I will tell you is given that you have the amount of river rock up there on that roof, that typically means the support system that you have in place. It's gonna have some extra, you know, psf ability. \n\n7:36 | Robb\nUp there. \n\n7:37 | Shane\nTo, and what we're gonna do, yeah. \n\n7:46 | Shane\nKind of, the just of whitemarsh questions, you know, based around, the broad look at that. Okay\u2026 you can do this if you want certainly don't have to. But this is, the, you know, the devil and the details of how we sort of get to where we are, right? Yeah. So kilowatt hour production. What I will tell you if you look at those two bills comparatively that you sent me the 2022 Bill, you guys are paying about 10 cents that 2021. I, about 20 cents that should let you know what electricity rates are doing now. I'm, still going to be conservative. I'm not using 20 cents because again, there can be variability Bill to Bill. I'm gonna be slightly conservative and show you that utility rate. If ultimately you're paying 20 cents payback could be even better than I'm talking about because that is substantial, but that's sort of the importance, of looking at Solar really, right? Like rates are going up. Vge is telling us that over the next three years, we might see an additional 30 percent increase. You know, they're pushing for that. \n\n8:58 | Robb\nRight. \n\n8:58 | Shane\nSo, you know, your utility spend is reduced by what you see on there for, you know, roughly 40 grand a year. We can see your capital cost. There is a Maryland grant that we can apply for, you know, every all science points that, you know, you would get that it caps on this system size at 20 grand the renewable energy credits. I think we discuss these, but basically, they're gonna get these in addition to, the energy savings it's sort of the offset, of renewable energy requirements for bte. They're gonna pay you some money via a broker, you know, for every 1,000 kilowatts you produce, you get one of these sex. Another reason to look at this now, west more did pass a renewable energy plan and they're increasing these sex over probably the next one to three years by one point five. So basically, they're multiplying by, you know, by one point five for the sex that are more valuable. They, they're allotting like 270 megawats, of system, to apply and get these. So you're well within receiving that right now. \n\n10:06 | Robb\nSo explain that, how do the mechanics of that work? What, what? Like what is that? So, do you make an application every year? Do you, what is that? \n\n10:18 | Shane\nWe hook you up with a broker. So you don't do anything except see money come into the account that you want it to every three months. So basically, what happens is, you know, you have, the inverter on the system tells all the information of how much energy is produced. We give access to rec, trade dot com. They're, a Solar renewable energy credit broker. So they'll look in every three months and go, okay, whitemarsh produced, you know, 35,000 kilowatt hours. They get, you know, 35 sex at, you know, 70 dollars bamboom, and they pay you out, right? So they're going a direct deposit. They're going to handle everything. They take a five percent fee. But again, it's not something you guys want to have any part of your team managing it's. It's certainly not worth it. You're more to there's no like kick back in the relationship. We just know that it's easy to set you up with people that know what they're doing. They give you the money. You move on. Now, you'll see that they sort of depreciatein time. I do believe that will remain a bit stronger because I think we're going to renew our energy goals to 100 percent renewable by, you know, 20 50, who knows what they're gonna say? But every state that's around us, DC, pa, Delaware now, Virginia all have 100 percent renewable energy goals. Maryland's likely going to keep up with Jones here, and do the same. So probably a conservative approach on those sec here, but, you know, I'd rather underpromise over deliver. \n\n11:55 | Robb\nSo, okay. So I see the money coming in there and it reduces because you think the value of sex is gonna go down. \n\n12:03 | Shane\nExactly. So there's an acp on these. So basically, all right. So, I dive a little deeper here. Bge has a renewable energy goal and a Solar goal. I think it's like 14 percent annually, that they need to produce electricity via Solar. They don't do that. They pay a huge fine. We know what that fine is gonna be. They know what that fine is gonna be. So basically, they see you producing Solar renewal, Solar via, their grid and their meters. So they say, well, I'm gonna take credit for that. I'm gonna give them a few bucks less than the fee that I would have to pay, right? So they're kind of hedging their losses, right? \n\n12:41 | Robb\nRight? So the money is coming from BG. \n\n12:46 | Shane\nTechnically, but it's almost like a market at this point. It's almost like a little wall street going on, right? And they're basically looking and saying, okay, they're producing this much. The value is worth this much. The acp predictably each year is this much. So this is how much we see it being worth, right? There's a chance that could change slightly up or down. I think again when you look further out is where you're going to see us increasing renewable energy goals and sort of, you know, maybe, that 11 447, you know, gets more solid for more years in advance. \n\n13:27 | Robb\nAnd the federal tax credit, how does the mechanics of that? Where you just fill out a form and. \n\n13:31 | Shane\nYeah. So when your accountant does taxes for whitemarsh, they're gonna say that you made a renewable energy upgrade and you are gonna get a 30 percent federal tax credit. So that amount again, if, you know, you pay half a 1,000,000 dollars in taxes there, you're going to pay 350,000, right? If I don't think you're getting money back. So I want to go there, you know, if let's say you paid 100,000 in taxes and you got that 158, you would actually get 58 back, right? \n\n14:01 | Robb\nRight. \n\n14:01 | Shane\nGot it. So it is a credit, you know? \n\n14:05 | Robb\nYep. Got it. \n\n14:06 | Shane\nThe, you see the tax impact. So we do take into account taxes, you can talk to your account on it. I mean, beings that you're bigger some of the, you know, residential homeowners don't worry about, you know, claiming the Rex or whatever you probably want to look into that we account for that. \n\n14:20 | Robb\nSure. We'll. \n\n14:21 | Shane\nshow you the depreciation there. So you are able to now right now, it is still 60 percent year one and then you'll take 10 percent for, the following for years. We are waiting for ink on paper to increase that, where you could take the entirety of the depreciation if you wanted to year one. I don't know how much, that matters or changes things to you. You can always disperse it amongst years if you want to as well\u2026 again, things that your account will be able to tell you. So sort of all of that information, right? The savings on utility spend, how much you're gonna pay, how much you saving, you know, depreciation, all of that. We come over here and then we just start, you know, reducing off, of, the net Solar cost, which tells us via all of those things after about four years, this system is even up for, you know? And then you can look over, you know, 25 years if it's up there, you know, you can save a 1,000,000 bucks. I mean, you know, ultimately this matters, right? I mean, it's producing. Yeah. What are you guys gonna make in 25 years? So. \n\n15:28 | Robb\nA chunk change, but\u2026 was the start investment? Yeah. I'm not sure. I follow the math, go to year six. We save 43,000 dollars, right? Right? And then we get 8,000 in X9 thousand, right? Looks like I can't really see it 80. Sorry, 8,700. Yeah. Right. So, how did you get to energy savings? 43,000? I'm not seeing that math. I. \n\n16:02 | Shane\nThat is right here over to your left. So basically we're saying. \n\n16:05 | Robb\nRight, right. \n\n16:07 | Shane\nMultiplied by your utility right now, I have a one and a half percent. \n\n16:12 | Robb\nNo, I get that. I get that, but your cash impact, 887 100. What the next thing is energy. So you're just bringing that 43 over exactly. Okay. And then you go, you subtract out\u2026 that the tax impact which I'm not sure what that is. \n\n16:32 | Shane\nThat's the tax on, the. \n\n16:35 | Robb\nGot. it. Get. Okay. A, I got it. All right. Very good. Good. Very good. Yeah. Okay. \n\n16:41 | Shane\nYeah. And I just highlight sort of 710 and 15 some, you know, bullet years. So you can kind of see, you know, the impact there, you know? \n\n16:51 | Robb\nOkay, good. Roof look like what's that? What's the roof look like? \n\n16:58 | Shane\nWhat does that put it? You mean this? \n\n17:01 | Robb\nYeah, that, yeah. Okay. So you've left us room around all of our. \n\n17:07 | Shane\nExactly. Yeah. You've got about four feet around everyone with a Lane to get to everyone\u2026 you know, is this the final design? Obviously, I don't know that, but we do know that you need access to all of those units you need, you know, pathways, and workaround so that. \n\n17:26 | Robb\nIt does it look like? I see you've got a pathway down at the bottom. \n\n17:32 | Shane\nYeah, there should be, I mean, maybe I missed one but there should be a pathway to every single unit or every single thing on here somewhere. \n\n17:43 | Robb\nOkay. \n\n17:44 | Shane\nAnd this is you, just if you can see my cursor, you know, your roof hatch is over here and you've got four feet around the edges, too, right? So\u2026 and again, this is me doing this design, right? And engineers going to come in and look at it. And you can also say, hey, I want it, you know, this way or, you know, maybe Jimmy looks at this and say, would really have it this way. \n\n18:09 | Robb\nGot it. Okay. Looks good. Yeah, it looks good. \n\n18:15 | Shane\nOkay. Yeah. Trying to be conservative. That also helps with, you know, again, if so, so what this would look like if they said, okay\u2026 we need to disperse the weight via the ballast more. So what the, what that 10 degree ballast looks like is, they spread the tray wider to disperse the weight. So there's less lift like direct lift, on the balance. \n\n18:42 | Robb\nOn. \n\n18:42 | Shane\nthe panels, right? So you have to have a larger span in between because we're gonna go from a five degree tilt to a 10 degree. So the shadow casts a bit longer, right? So basically, what this would look like is just a bit more space in between the\u2026 you know, I guess let's say the horizontal space and panels, it would go from like seven or eight inches to probably 16 or 17. \n\n19:12 | Robb\nOkay. So it's just less panels at that point. Yeah. \n\n19:16 | Shane\nAgain, it would likely be less panels. We would increase, the site quality or the ratio of production because at 10 degrees, again, it's sort of the math, you know, five degree gives a larger system which gives a bigger offset of electricity. The 10 degrees will actually give you better production. But again, because of the spacing less offset. \n\n19:38 | Robb\nHow long do these panels? \n\n19:39 | Shane\nLast? So great question. Everything that we have up on that roof has a manufacturer's warranty of 25 years. The panels will likely last, everything would last longer than that. But given that you would probably need to, you know, do this roof, you know, in the next, let's say 20 years. \n\n20:01 | Robb\nAt that. \n\n20:02 | Shane\nPoint you would probably look at, okay, we've made our bank on this, what's the next latest and greatest technology, you know? And maybe. \n\n20:11 | Robb\na, \n\n20:13 | Shane\nyou can remove and reinstall the system again given the length of time before you're gonna need to do that. I think you're looking at sort of, you know, a replacement to the system if you will. \n\n20:26 | Robb\nCan you dispose of these just an irregular landfill? \n\n20:30 | Shane\nSo you can, or you can recycle them. There's a cost to that right now. I'm hoping that changes. \n\n20:39 | Robb\nSo, you would probably disposal. \n\n20:44 | Shane\nRight now, yes, I think by the time that you're going to do that, they're going to be easily recyclable. It is a huge piece of, our industry right now that they are really looking. You know, again, if we're going to try and save the world, we can't just fill the landfills, like it's counter. Productive. So, I think that you will have, \n\n21:05 | Robb\nit's kind of the whole issue with like the wind turbines and things like that carbon, or then what they're saying? \n\n21:13 | Shane\nI know I got an all electric car, and I look at it now and I'm like did I even make the right decision? I think the right decision is a hybrid. \n\n21:21 | Robb\nYou. \n\n21:21 | Shane\nknow, because again, you're not mining, if you have a short trip, you can run off battery. \n\n21:28 | Robb\nI wish they'd had done it, you know? \n\n21:29 | Shane\nSo, you know, we don't know, I mean, we know, this is good. It's right at the end of the day, it's a smart financial investment, you know, and look, I would say there's just like a undetermined value to this in that you have a ribbon cutting and you let everybody know that, hey, I'm running, this building of renewable energy there's people that are gonna come to your club because of that. I mean, you know, again, you're making\u2026 book bucks a few extra members, but I think it's a cool thing to advertise, and a cool value to add to your company. I really do. \n\n22:07 | Robb\nI'm sure our marketing people will love it. \n\n22:12 | Shane\nAll right. So, I should have sort of laid out, you know, what the beginning at the beginning, sort of what this lock? \n\n22:16 | Robb\nBut the, you know, so I. \n\n22:17 | Shane\ntake a step back here. Typically, what we look to do from here is loesslntp which allows us again collect some money so that we can go up on the roof and do some work that would all go towards, you know, the final contract amount. The other way to do it is if you feel really good about this, and you understand sort of what the, you know, the high level potential changes on system size are, we can go right to contract. You can red line we can, you know, the lntp fntp is in there, you know, so, so whatever speed you're looking to move at this, you can, but that's sort of the next steps is if you're coming out of this meeting and saying, I like it, I think we want to do it. I'm guessing you've got to talk to a few people before that. \n\n23:04 | Robb\nI forgot to run this by our CEO. \n\n23:06 | Shane\nSure. I get it. But that would be, you know, the next go of this. \n\n23:13 | Robb\nWhy would, why would, yeah, why wouldn't we just go to contract? I would share. \n\n23:19 | Shane\nLet me get off you real quick. I would share that sentiment with you because again, you know, the loe, basically, it's if you're looking and saying, okay, well, I want to know what the final system size is before I say yes, but the reality is what I, what I'm say? \n\n23:35 | Robb\nIt's the same whether it's 260, 260,000 kilowatts or 220,000 kilos, right? \n\n23:43 | Shane\nThe economics are going to be the same. \n\n23:45 | Robb\nI was just say let's go to contract. \n\n23:47 | Shane\nThat's that's sort of the way, that, I, \n\n23:51 | Robb\nhow about you do this? Then shoot me that presentation and then prepare a contract. I mean, I'm confident that I'll show my CEO and he's a co, trustee on and he'll say, yeah, this looks good. Let's do it. We need a guinea pig because if we're ever gonna do this in a broader sense, we still haven't figured out how to do it on our mayor property zone buildings, but this one's easy. Yeah, it makes complete financial sense. And like you say, I'm sure there'll be some marketing blah, blah blah that. \n\n24:24 | Shane\nA big real estate sign on the front with the overhead we'll give you. I mean, honestly part of this too, like we like it, right? So it can be one of those things where we can put together a drone video for you guys. You know, we can do some cool stuff on the side, you know, to sort of, you know, make it look cool. Yeah, you know, put you in a little cameo of a video for Linkedin, you know, you'll be the, you know, the savior of Baltimore county. \n\n24:51 | Robb\nYou're not getting me to do that. That's for sure. I'm as skeptical about all this nonsense as anybody. Probably more. Okay. Well, good. Well, well, yeah, shoot me this and you can start working on a contract because I'm. \n\n25:05 | Shane\nyeah, I'll put it all up together and. \n\n25:08 | Robb\nI know I won't see him today, but I will see him Monday. \n\n25:11 | Shane\nYeah. \n\n25:11 | Robb\nThat's if you shoot it to me, at least I'll shoot an e-mail to him and let him know. I think that we should do this and then he might even just get back to me and say, go ahead. \n\n25:21 | Shane\nOkay. Do you want me to, is there any, do you want to put me into like the names or anything like that as far as what you would want to see on the contract at this point? \n\n25:31 | Robb\nRight? The entities off shooting. Yeah. \n\n25:34 | Shane\nYou can shoot the entities if you're going to be, the main point of contact or if there's somebody else that? \n\n25:40 | Robb\nI'll be the main point. Okay. Yes. All right. Perfect. Okay. Great. \n\n25:45 | Shane\nI appreciate your time this morning. I'll get that, you know, sometime early next week, I'll have the contract out. I'll shoot this proposal in about five minutes. It does have the other two on there. So you guys can just, you know, internally discuss that in the future. \n\n25:58 | Robb\nA, we have an inhouse tax guy and well, I don't think he's figured out a solution yet on those that's the issue. So, but it'd be nice to know because if we can figure it out that it would be nice to know what our spend is if we were to do all. \n\n26:13 | Shane\nI would mention maybe he's already thought of it, but I would just mention to him about putting the Solar as its own, you know, LLC where you could then kind of put it to whomever, and then maybe you just, I, so whoever owns it and then you just Bill the, you know, eldersberg, or towson, the cost of, the electricity, right? You can give them sort of a reduced rate. \n\n26:38 | Robb\nWell, I'm not sure. I understand that. So the clubs pay the electric Bill. \n\n26:43 | Shane\nCorrect? So, if let's. \n\n26:45 | Robb\nthat's how building, but they don't own the building. \n\n26:48 | Shane\nRight. So, if towson, so if merit properties owns it, the building and I'm just naming. \n\n26:54 | Robb\nYou as to. \n\n26:54 | Shane\nSay they own it, they own that system, right? So they're gonna get all the depreciation all of the same. \n\n26:59 | Robb\nA mayor crates can't take those deductions that's that. \n\n27:03 | Shane\nCould you set up an LLC that the club could own? You could make an ease in on the roof, for merit? \n\n27:16 | Robb\nMaybe. But then the problem becomes if you sell the building and you have this system there and the new owner doesn't want it, it's a little more complicated in that situation. \n\n27:29 | Shane\nA much smarter than I am, I sort. \n\n27:31 | Robb\nHe's figured out a couple of ways and they've all be at the end of the day. What he's figured out so far, it has not been worth our effort to work. It's. Just been like, wow, that's complicated and difficult and we're not getting the benefit. This one's simple. This one's easy. Send the other two. And I'll we'll show it. We're in there, you know, the first. \n\n27:52 | Shane\nThe slides are for whitemarsh. The rest of it's in there. You guys do as you will. My focus is obviously whitemarsh, and to help you with any other information you need along. \n\n27:59 | Robb\nthe way, very good. \n\n28:01 | Shane\nAll right, Rob, thanks so much, Van, you have a great weekend. \n\n28:05 | Robb\nOkay. Thank you. Shane, appreciate it again. Bye bye. "
