            "Oleg, thanks for passing this along. Here are my concerns:\n\nThe primary issue with the family next door is the noise from their children. While it has somewhat improved, it remains a problem. The children are simply bored and trying to entertain themselves. Though it can be disruptive, this is not something within our control, and further discussion on this matter is not productive.\n\nHere are the actionable issues the landlord must address:\n\n1. **Mice/Rats**: I have observed mice and their droppings in my house, a first in my four years of residence. Additionally, I hear scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor\u2019s house, suggesting an infestation there as well. The landlord must take immediate action by hiring an exterminator to eliminate this problem and secure entry points. This will mitigate the issue for both properties.\n\n2. **Back Yard**: The landlord is responsible for landscaping and removing the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. This must be addressed promptly as it infringes on your property.\n\n3. **Front Yard**: The overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house are unsightly and unacceptable. The landlord must trim or remove them to maintain the property\u2019s appearance.\n\n4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles are falling off the front of the house, creating an eyesore and potential hazard. A mere patch job will not suffice; the entire roof requires replacement to prevent further deterioration.\n\nTo summarize, my specific demands are:\n- Eliminate the mice and secure entry points.\n- Clean and landscape the back yard, especially where it abuts your fence.\n- Clean and landscape the front yard, removing any weeds or trees encroaching on my property.\n- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues permanently.\n\nI expect prompt action on these matters. Please inform me if there are any steps I can take to facilitate these resolutions.\n\nMark"

            "Oleg, thanks for passing this along. Here are my demands:\n\nThe main issue with the family next door is the incessant noise from their children. Although there has been some improvement, it remains a disturbance. While I understand that the children are bored and trying to entertain themselves, this disruption cannot continue, and any further discussion on this matter is pointless.\n\nThe following are the landlord's responsibilities that must be addressed immediately:\n\n1. **Mice/Rats**: I have found mice and their droppings in my house for the first time in four years. The scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor's house suggest an infestation there as well. The landlord must hire an exterminator to eradicate this issue and secure entry points. Failure to act will result in further complaints and potential legal action.\n\n2. **Back Yard**: The landlord must address the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. This is an infringement on your property and must be resolved immediately.\n\n3. **Front Yard**: The overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house are unsightly and unacceptable. The landlord must trim or remove them to maintain the property's appearance and avoid further degradation.\n\n4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles falling off the front of the house are an eyesore and pose a potential hazard. A patch job will not suffice; the entire roof requires replacement to prevent further issues. If not addressed, this will lead to further action.\n\nTo summarize, my demands are:\n- Eliminate the mice and secure entry points immediately.\n- Clean and landscape the back yard where it abuts your fence without delay.\n- Clean and landscape the front yard, removing weeds and trees encroaching on my property immediately.\n- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues permanently.\n\nImmediate action is expected on these matters. Failure to comply will result in escalation and potential legal action. Let me know if I can assist in ensuring these issues are resolved promptly.\n\nMark"

            "Oleg, thanks for passing this along. Here are my thoughts and demands:\n\nThe primary issue with the family next door is the noise from their children. While there has been some improvement, it remains a problem. The children are very sweet and friendly, and I understand they are simply bored and trying to entertain themselves. Though it can be disruptive, this is not something within our control, and further discussion on this matter is not productive.\n\nHowever, there are several serious issues that the landlord must address immediately, as they pertain to the health, safety, and overall well-being of the tenants:\n\n1. **Mice/Rats**: I have observed mice and their droppings in my house, which is a first in my four years of residence here. Additionally, I hear scratching noises from the wall adjacent to the neighbor\u2019s house, suggesting an infestation there as well. According to Baltimore County Code \u00a7 13-7-112, landlords are required to maintain their properties in a habitable condition, which includes ensuring the premises are free from rodents and other pests. Failure to address this issue constitutes a violation of this code and presents a serious health hazard to tenants. The presence of mice and their droppings is not only unsanitary but also poses risks of disease. The landlord must hire an exterminator immediately to eliminate this problem and secure all entry points. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in fines and further legal action.\n\n2. **Back Yard**: The landlord is responsible for maintaining the property, including landscaping and removing the overgrown weeds encroaching into your yard. This overgrowth infringes on your property and must be addressed promptly.\n\n3. **Front Yard**: The overgrown weeds and bushes covering my house are unsightly and unacceptable. According to Baltimore County regulations, property owners must keep their properties in a condition that does not adversely affect neighboring properties. The landlord must trim or remove these overgrowths to maintain the property\u2019s appearance and prevent further degradation.\n\n4. **Overall Appearance of the Front**: The shingles falling off the front of the house are creating an eyesore and potential hazard. This situation also falls under the maintenance obligations of the landlord, as stipulated in Baltimore County Code \u00a7 13-7-112, which requires landlords to keep the exterior of the property in good repair. A mere patch job will not suffice; the entire roof requires replacement to prevent further deterioration.\n\nTo summarize, my specific demands are:\n- Eliminate the mice and secure all entry points immediately. Failure to do so will result in filing complaints with Baltimore County authorities and pursuing further legal action.\n- Clean and landscape the back yard, especially where it abuts your fence.\n- Clean and landscape the front yard, removing any weeds or trees encroaching on my property.\n- Replace or significantly repair the roof to resolve the shingle issues permanently.\n\nImmediate action is expected on these matters. Non-compliance will result in further complaints to Baltimore County Code Enforcement and legal action to enforce these requirements. Please inform me if there are any steps I can take to facilitate these resolutions.\n\nBest regards,  \nMark"
