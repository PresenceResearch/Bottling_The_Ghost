management and prioritization \n\n#### Available on \n\n  * Everywhere you check email \n\n#### Standout features \n\n  * AI-powered inbox sorting and prioritization \n  * Automated unsubscribe and \"SaneBlackHole\" for unwanted senders \n  * Reminders, follow-up tracking, and email snoozing \n  * Integrates seamlessly with Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients \n\nIf your inbox is a source of constant stress and overwhelm, SaneBox could be the AI email assistant you need to regain control. \n\nThis powerful tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically sort, prioritize, and filter your emails based on importance.\n\nWith SaneBox, emails from key clients, colleagues, and contacts get surfaced to the top of your inbox, while low-priority messages like newsletters and notifications get neatly tucked away in dedicated folders. \n\nYou can even set up rules to automatically unsubscribe or blackhole unwanted senders entirely.\n\n[Image 11: SaneBox email follow-up] (\u301049\u2020Image Source\u2020www.sanebox.com\u3011) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nFor me, the biggest selling point of SaneBox is the sheer amount of time and mental energy it saves. \n\nNo more wading through an endless stream of clutter and noise to find the emails that actually matter. \n\nSaneBox handles all of that automatically, allowing me to focus on the high-impact tasks and messages.\n\nI'm also a big fan of SaneBox's email tracking and reminder capabilities. \n\nThe tool keeps tabs on all emails that need follow-ups or responses, ensuring nothing important gets overlooked or forgotten. \n\nYou can even set up custom snooze times for emails you want to deal with later.\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile SaneBox is incredibly useful once set up, getting there does require some initial time investment. \n\nYou'll need to train the AI on your preferences and make manual corrections early on to ensure emails are being properly categorized. \n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve involved.\n\n#### SaneBox pricing \n\nAppetizer plan: $0.07 daily or $24 annually \n\nSnack plan: $7 monthly, $59 annually + 3 months free, or $99 biannually + 9 months free \n\nLunch plan: $12 monthly, $99 annually + 3 months free, or $169 biannually + 9 months free \n\nD",

When writing a new email, look to the right half of the toolbar, click on the Copilot icon, and select Draft with Copilot.

Super helpful for searching your conversations for specific statements.\n\nBut the last one really surprised me.

examples] (\u301048\u2020Image Source\u2020www.smartwriter.ai\u3011) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nI've spent way too much time manually crafting personalized cold emails in the past, I can't overstate how much of a time-saver SmartWriter is. \n\nBeing able to generate dozens of tailored icebreakers with just a few clicks is a game-changer for outbound campaigns.\n\nI'm also a big fan of SmartWriter's automated follow-up capabilities. \n\nThe tool can intelligently generate and send customized follow-up emails to any leads that don't respond initially. \n\nThis ensures no opportunities slip through the cracks.\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile SmartWriter's AI-generated content is impressively personalized, it's not perfect. \n\nOccasionally, the suggestions can miss the mark or feel a bit generic \u2013 especially for niche industries or highly technical subject matter. \n\nA fair bit of manual editing and quality control is still required.\n\nSmartWriter is also a fairly pricey solution, with even the basic plan starting at $59/month. \n\nThis may put it out of reach for smaller teams, freelancers, or those on tight budgets.\n\n#### SmartWriter pricing (billed annually)\n\nBasic plan: $49 per month \n\nPopular plan: $124 per month \n\nPro plan: $299 per month \n\nTry SmartWriter's 7-day free trial of its paid plans, no credit card required.\n\n  CTA

management and prioritization \n\n#### Available on \n\n  * Everywhere you check email \n\n#### Standout features \n\n  * AI-powered inbox sorting and prioritization \n  * Automated unsubscribe and \"SaneBlackHole\" for unwanted senders \n  * Reminders, follow-up tracking, and email snoozing \n  * Integrates seamlessly with Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients \n\nIf your inbox is a source of constant stress and overwhelm, SaneBox could be the AI email assistant you need to regain control. \n\nThis powerful tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically sort, prioritize, and filter your emails based on importance.\n\nWith SaneBox, emails from key clients, colleagues, and contacts get surfaced to the top of your inbox, while low-priority messages like newsletters and notifications get neatly tucked away in dedicated folders. \n\nYou can even set up rules to automatically unsubscribe or blackhole unwanted senders entirely.\n\n[Image 11: SaneBox email follow-up] (\u301049\u2020Image Source\u2020www.sanebox.com\u3011) \n\n#### What I liked \n\nFor me, the biggest selling point of SaneBox is the sheer amount of time and mental energy it saves. \n\nNo more wading through an endless stream of clutter and noise to find the emails that actually matter. \n\nSaneBox handles all of that automatically, allowing me to focus on the high-impact tasks and messages.\n\nI'm also a big fan of SaneBox's email tracking and reminder capabilities. \n\nThe tool keeps tabs on all emails that need follow-ups or responses, ensuring nothing important gets overlooked or forgotten. \n\nYou can even set up custom snooze times for emails you want to deal with later.\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile SaneBox is incredibly useful once set up, getting there does require some initial time investment. \n\nYou'll need to train the AI on your preferences and make manual corrections early on to ensure emails are being properly categorized. \n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve involved.\n\n#### SaneBox pricing \n\nAppetizer plan: $0.07 daily or $24 annually \n\nSnack plan: $7 monthly, $59 annually + 3 months free, or $99 biannually + 9 months free \n\nLunch plan: $12 monthly, $99 annually + 3 months free, or $169 biannually + 9 months free \n\nD",

access its AI writing capabilities right where I needed them, without disrupting my existing workflows.\n\nThe quality of the AI-generated content is also top-notch. \n\nFlowrite does an impressive job of capturing the right tone and style, whether I need something formal for a client email or more casual for an internal team update.\u200e\n\n#### What I disliked \n\nWhile Flowrite's automations are incredibly powerful, there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to setting them up initially. \n\nThe platform could benefit from some more user-friendly onboarding and documentation to help new users get the most out of these advanced features.\n\nAdditionally, as an AI-powered tool, Flowrite isn't perfect. \n\nOccasionally, the generated content can feel a bit generic or miss the mark in terms of context and nuance. \n\nHowever, this is a limitation of AI writing assistants in general, and Flowrite does a better job than most at producing high-quality, tailored content.\n\n#### Flowrite pricing (billed annually)\n\nLight plan: $4 per month for 200 messages per year \n\nPremium plan: $12 per month for 2,000 messages per year \n\nUnlimited plan: $24 per month for unlimited

AI is one tool out of many, so these apps should offer other features and settings to help you save time and get to inbox zero faster.\n\n  * Data privacy. Your emails are private, so adding an app like this to your collection shouldn't represent a security risk. I read the privacy policy of each app to understand how secure your data will be.\n\nFor two weeks, I dug the internet for all the AI email assistants that I could find. I filtered out those that just integrated generative AI into the compose window and was left with a smaller selection. I signed up for each of them, configured the platform until it was ready to use, and sent a few emails back and forth between my email accounts. I played with the settings, observed how well the AI did what I wanted it to, and from there, picked these apps.\n\n## The best AI email assistants at a glance\n\nBest for \n\nStandout features \n\nPricing  \n\nShortwave \n\nSearch \n\nFlexible AI assistants; deep integration with Google Calendar \n\nFrom $8.50/user/month  \n\nMicrosoft Copilot Pro for Outlook \n\nImproving communication \n\nAlso unlocks features in other Microsoft apps \n\nMicrosoft 365 subscription required, starting at $9.99/ month; AI features $20/month  \n\nSuperhuman \n\nMixing AI generation with message templates \n\nLots of great keyboard shortcuts\n\n$30/user/month  \n\nSaneBox \n\nKeeping your inbox organized \n\nExcellent priority-focused categorization \n\nStarting from $0.07/day or $24/year  \n\nMailbutler \n\nGathering contact details and tasks \n\nExtracts data from email signatures; identifies tasks and integrates with task management apps \n\nStarting from $14.95/month for AI features   \n\n* * *\n\n## Best AI email assistant for searching email history\n\n### \u3010102\u2020Shortwave\u2020www.shortwave.com\u3011 (Web, Android, iOS)\n\n[Image 3: Shortwave, our pick for the best AI email assistant for searching email history]\n\nShortwave pros:\n\n  * Deep integration with Google Calendar \n\n  * AI assistant is very flexible \n\nShortwave cons:\n\n  * Interface feels cluttered at times \n\nSitting confidently on the throne here, Shortwave has the widest range of AI features of all the apps on this list. They all live in the top-right of your screen: click on the magic stars icon there, and a chat window appears docked on the right side. This is the Shortwave AI Assistant.\n\nThe most unique possibility it offers is AI-powered email search. You can ask questions to your inbox to surface old, forgotten conversations without actually having to get lost in the mess. More than this, it can extract data from email threads (\"make a list of all the tasks in the website redesign project\"), generate content (\"write a tweet based on my emails about productivity\"), or answer your questions ChatGPT-style.\n\nEmail and calendars usually go hand in hand.

Outlook is one of the apps that gets a boost, with three shiny AI features that, while not groundbreaking, are really well-implemented and easy to use. And, since we're talking about a tech giant, this list could expand quickly.\n\nThe first one is straightforward: you can write emails from scratch using AI. When writing a new email, look to the right half of the toolbar, click on the Copilot icon, and select Draft with Copilot. That will open the settings, where you can type your prompt, set the tone and length, and then start generating.\n\nThe second one is thread summarization: like others on this list, you can get a big-picture view of a conversation in a list of topics. Unlike others on this list, Copilot adds little numbers in superscript that you can use to jump to the message where that topic is discussed. Super helpful for searching your conversations for specific statements.\n\nBut the last one really surprised me. Called Coaching by Copilot, you can have your email message analyzed to see how the tone, content, and structure of the email will impact the receiver. I wrote a general project kickoff email to test this, and it told me I could be more enthusiastic, show appreciation for the reader's contribution, and break down the topics for higher clarity. This comes with a few example sentences, so you know how to take the first steps. A well-written email can save you a lot of headaches along the way, so I find this very helpful to manage projects, provide updates, and make communication more effective.\n\nOutlook wraps it up with a nice touch: if you generate an email with AI and click to send right away, it'll show a pop-up reminding you that AI may be inaccurate, inviting you to revisit the content before pushing it out. \n\nAnd, of course, this isn't the only place where you'll be getting AI. You'll also get \u3010104\u2020Copilot features\u3011 to help write documents in Word, generate presentations in PowerPoint, and analyze data in Excel.
